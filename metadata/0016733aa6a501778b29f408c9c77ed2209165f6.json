This vast repertory of chants is the oldest music known as it is the first repertory to have been adequately notated in the 10th century[citation needed]. In general, the chants were learnt by the viva voce method, that is by following the given example orally, which took many years of experience in the Schola Cantorum. Gregorian chant originated in Monastic life, in which singing the 'Divine Service' nine times a day at the proper hours was upheld according to the Rule of St. Benedict. Singing psalms made up a large part of the life in a monastic community, while a smaller group and soloists sang the chants. In its long history Gregorian Chant has been subjected to many gradual changes and some reforms. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_chant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_chant&lt;/a&gt;\n\nrecorded at 128 kbps, mp3 format &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inspirations-Gregorian-Chant/dp/B000000LOB/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1244933068&amp;sr=8-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inspirations-Gregorian-Chant/dp/B000000LOB/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1244933068&amp;sr=8-2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=43:12845&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=43:12845&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSalve festa dies, hymn in mode 4\nAlleluja, Nili Flere (Easter Procession)\nTulerant dominum meum (Easter Processions)\nEgo sum alpha (Easter Processions)\nExpurgate vetus fermentum (Easter Procession)\nAlleluja, Alleluja, Laudate Dominum (Easter Procession)\nAlleluja, Venite, Exultemus Domino (Easter Procession)\nExitu Israel de Aegypto (Easter Procession)\nAd coenam agni providi\nSalve dies dierum gloria (Easter Procession)\nMagnificat (et vaide mane...), Easter processional\nBenedicamus Domino (Exultemus. . . ), for the Easter Procession\nOffertory for the Easter Procession\nHymn for the Easter Procession\nOffertory for the Easter Procession\nAnciennes Alleluiatiques Gallicanes (Easter Processions)\nResponsory Psalms for the Ascension (Easter Processions)\nChants Mozarbes (Elegies For Kings and Princes/The Wedding At Cana)\nPlanctus Karoli\nLitanie (Elegies for Kings and Princes / The Wedding at Cana)\nPlanctus de Paulin d'Aquilee\nPlanctus Hugonis Abbatis\nIn anniversario Domni dagoberti regis\nLament for William the Conqueror\nOffice for the Dead: lesson &amp; response\nHymne de Toussaint (Elegies For Kings and Princes/The Wedding At Cana)\nLe Miracle des Noces de Cana\nAncienne (Elegies For Kings and Princes/The Wedding At Cana)\nJesu Corona Celsior, hymn\nOratoire de l'ancien testament (Elegies For Kings and Princes/The Wedding At Cana)\nDominus, for the midnight mass at Christmas\nPuer natus est nobis, introit for morning mass at Christmas\nResurrexi et adhuc tecum sum, introit for Easter in mode 4\nVictimae paschali laudes, sequence in mode 1 for Easter (1.
