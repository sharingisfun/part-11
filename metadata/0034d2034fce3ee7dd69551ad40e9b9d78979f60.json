A video series of six lessons is now presented on two DVDs with a total duration of three hours. Juan Martin explains and demonstrates the essential techniques and rhythmic forms of flamenco Guiar playing in six lessons, designed for all players from beginning to advanced. The lessons show you in detail many varieties of basic rhythms which form the foundation of flamenco Guitar styles. They also give a wealth of traditional and modern flamenco solos, accurately transcribed into music notation and easy-to-follow 'cifra' tablature, all presented in a video series of six lessons. In this way you learn not only how to play but also what to play, as the lessons build into a substantial repertoire of flamenco music. Juan Martin is a Guitarist in the great tradition of flamenco. From early beginnings immersed in the flamenco culture of Andalucia, he mastered the skills of accompanying flamenco singers and dancers before his emergence as an innovative soloist, who is now an internationally-celebrated concert and recording artist with many albums to his credit.\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.moltengold.com/cgi-bin/eBzget6A.pl?shop=1478Flamencov&amp;trolley=448237&amp;page=http://www.flamencovision.com/music_books.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.moltengold.com/cgi-bin/eBzget6A.pl?shop=1478Flamencov&amp;trolley=448237&amp;page=http://www.flamencovision.com/music_books.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Guitarra-Flamenca-Pvg-Juan-Martin/dp/0571531024/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239814697&amp;sr=8-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Guitarra-Flamenca-Pvg-Juan-Martin/dp/0571531024/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239814697&amp;sr=8-2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0034d2034fce3ee7dd69551ad40e9b9d78979f60","amp;dn":"Juan+Martin%3A+La+Guitarra+Flamenca+%282008%2C+Book+%26+2DVDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0034d2034fce3ee7dd69551ad40e9b9d78979f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,52,210,3,79,206,62,231,221,105,85,26,212,14,155,157,120,151,159,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
