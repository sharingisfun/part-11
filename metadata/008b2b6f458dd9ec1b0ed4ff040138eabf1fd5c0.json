Born November 17, 1967, he's one of a handful of bright rising stars on the modern blues scene. For most of the 1990s and into the 2000s, he's worked each of his records the old-fashioned way, by playing anywhere and everywhere he and his band can play. Unlike so many others before him, Benoit understands that blues is not a medium in favor with 50,000-watt commercial rock radio stations, so as a consequence, he's combined each of his releases with as many shows as he can possibly play. Since the release of his first album for Justice, Benoit has taken his brand of Cajun-influenced blues all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Nice and Warm, his debut album for Houston-based Justice Records, prompted some critics to say he was sometimes reminiscent of three blues guitar gods: Albert King, Albert Collins, and Jimi Hendrix.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Medicine\n02.Sunrise\n03.A Whole Lotta Soul\n04.Come And Get It\n05.Broke And Lonely\n06.Long Lonely Bayou\n07.In It To Win It\n08.Can't You See\n09.Nothing Takes The Place Of You\n10.Next To Me\n11.Mudboat Melissa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:008b2b6f458dd9ec1b0ed4ff040138eabf1fd5c0","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Tab+Benoit+-+Medicine+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"008b2b6f458dd9ec1b0ed4ff040138eabf1fd5c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,139,43,111,69,141,217,236,27,14,212,255,4,1,56,234,191,31,213,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
