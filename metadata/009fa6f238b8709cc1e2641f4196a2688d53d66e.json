But such ordeals are colorful stories for another time because\n   these guys are simply thrilled (but not to death) with the finished product.\n   ÃƒÂ´We&amp;#039;re more influenced by hardcore music than anything else,ÃƒÂ¶ Frost says of\n   Search The City&amp;#039;s sound. ÃƒÂ´It doesn&amp;#039;t show so much because we&amp;#039;re pretty pop-y\n   in parts. But collectively, we all love bands like Jimmy Eat World and bands\n   like that.ÃƒÂ¶ So how would they describe their unique style? ÃƒÂ´We&amp;#039;d probably say\n   progressive rock or something like that,ÃƒÂ¶ answers Frost.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
