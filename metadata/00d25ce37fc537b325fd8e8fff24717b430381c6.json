Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper \n(bass) had been fired in June 1969 and were replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, respectively.\n\nDeep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the \ncharts for months. (The band's prior MK I albums had been much better received in North America than in their \nhomeland.) The album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.\n\nAlthough this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had \nearlier recorded the live Concerto for Group and Orchestra. The album was also preceded by two singles, the \nfirst studio recordings that Gillan made with Deep Purple. The first single, released in 1969, was a Greenaway-Cook \ncomposition called &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, which flopped. The second single, &quot;Black Night&quot;, fared much better as it rose all \nthe way to #2 on the UK charts.\n\nIn 2005 the album won the Classic Rock Roll Of Honour Award (given by the British monthly magazine Classic Rock) \nin the category Classic Album. The award was presented to Ian Gillan, Ian Paice and Jon Lord.\n\n[SHM-CD Japanese WPCR-13110]\n\n\n   1. Deep Purple - Speed King                                [04:23]\n   2.
