Both members alternate as lead vocalists and play rhythm guitar in the duo. They first performed together in 1998, and after writing several songs for other country artists, they were signed to a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2003.\nTheir first studio album, Horse of a Different Color, was released in 2004. This album featured what has become their signature song, &quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot;, as well as three other top 40 singles, including their debut single, &quot;Wild West Show&quot;. The album featured collaborations with Cowboy Troy, Gretchen Wilson, and Martina McBride.\nComin' to Your City, released in November 2005, added another top-20 single, the Vietnam War-inspired &quot;8th of November&quot;, as well as two other songs that reached the top 40. Joining the duo on this album were Cowboy Troy, Wilson, and Kris Kristofferson. Their third studio album, Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace, produced their first Number One single, the wedding ballad &quot;Lost in This Moment&quot;. The duo also branched out beyond country music, collaborating with John Legend, Wyclef Jean, and Lil Jon.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f1fac9246ae657da7b4728c18b596d913763f5","amp;dn":"Big+%26+Rich-4+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f1fac9246ae657da7b4728c18b596d913763f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,241,250,201,36,106,230,87,218,123,71,40,193,139,89,109,145,55,99,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
