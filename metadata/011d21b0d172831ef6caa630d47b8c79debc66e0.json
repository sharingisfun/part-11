Although most of their lyrics are in English, vocalist Carmelo Orlando sings in Italian occasionally in many of their songs. They released their first two albums, Wish I Could Dream It Again and Arte Novecento, through Italian label Polyphemus. In the mid-90's, they signed with Century Media to release their next three albums, Classica, Novembrine Waltz, and Dreams d'Azur. More recently, Novembre signed to Peaceville Records, to release their sixth album Materia, which took on a progressive rock influence, and their seventh album, The Blue, which saw a return to addition of death metal-esque passages. After 8 years of absence, Novembre is about to commence work on a new studio album, to be released on Peaceville Records on April 1, 2016. But at the time, it has also been announced that the bandâ€™s longtime drummer &amp; co-founder Giuseppe Orlando left the band, leaving Carmelo Orlando as the only original member.\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n  \t[1994.00, POLYPH-001] Wish I Could Dream It Again [CD, album]\r\n  \t[1996.02, POLYPH-008] Arte Novecento [CD, album]\r\n  \t[2001.10, 77364-2] Novembrine Waltz [CD, album]\r\n  \t[2002.11, 77464-2] Dreams D'Azur [CD, album]\r\n  \t[2006.04, CDVILEF131] Materia [CD, album]\r\n  \t[2006.04, self-released] Memoria Stoica [Web, EP]\r\n  \t[2007.11, CDVILEF177] The Blue [CD, album]\r\n  \t[2008.10, CDVILED252] Classica [CD, album, reissue, remastered]\r\n         2016      Ursa\r\n\r\nFor individual tracks click on files\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Carmelo Orlando - guitar, vocals, keyboards, instruments (1990â€“present)\r\n    Massimiliano Pagliuso - guitar (1995â€“present)\r\n    Fabio Fraschini - Bass (2002-2007, 2015-present)\r\n    David Folchitto - Drums (2015-present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:011d21b0d172831ef6caa630d47b8c79debc66e0","amp;dn":"+Novembre+Discography+1994+-2016+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"011d21b0d172831ef6caa630d47b8c79debc66e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,29,33,176,209,114,131,30,246,202,166,48,212,123,140,121,222,188,102,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
