Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.\nThen, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.\n\nColton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go. \n\nFalling Into Us (Falling #2) by Jasinda Wilder (June 19th 2013)\n\nTHE STORY YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW...\n\nWhen Kyle Calloway died, he took a part of Nell with him. She wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one left to pick up the pieces, however; KyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death left a gaping hole in the hearts and lives of his parents and his older brother Colton, and ultimately broke the will of the girl he loved.\n\nTHE STORY YOU NEVER IMAGINED...\n\nBecca de Rosa is NellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. When Kyle died, Nell was so devastated that no one could reach her, not even her best friend Becca. As she tries to help Nell through her grief, BeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own life is thrust into turmoil, and everything she knows is changed.\n\nJason Dorsey asked Nell out the week after her sixteenth birthday, but that date never happened. Instead, he ended up going out with NellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, Becca. He had no way of knowing, then, how that one date would send him on a life-long journey with Becca. He had no way of knowing the tragedies and triumphs he would experience, or that in Becca, he might find the love of a lifetime.\n\nTHE HEARTACHE YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢LL NEVER FORGET...\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01203002a9f860051e1e09ac1817b6b81b6fe0e1","amp;dn":"Falling+Series+%281-2%29+by+Jasinda+Wilder+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01203002a9f860051e1e09ac1817b6b81b6fe0e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,32,48,2,169,248,96,5,30,30,9,172,24,23,182,184,27,111,224,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
