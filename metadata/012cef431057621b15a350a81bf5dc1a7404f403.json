Expert authorship, an engaging writing style, and an interesting collection of cases combine to communicate the importance of managing operations and processes within a successful organisation. Operations Management provides a strategic perspective, whilst also examining the practical issues which organisations face on a day to day basis. It uses over 120 examples from all over the world, reflecting the balance of economic activity between service (c.75%) and manufacturing (c.25%) operations.\n\n# Paperback: 686 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 6 edition (January 27, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0273731602\n# ISBN-13: 978-0273731603","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:012cef431057621b15a350a81bf5dc1a7404f403","amp;dn":"Operations+Management%2C6th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"012cef431057621b15a350a81bf5dc1a7404f403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,44,239,67,16,87,98,27,21,163,80,168,27,245,220,26,116,4,244,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
