This will enable him to achieve a proper design of process equipment.\n\nThe book covers various interesting topics such as units and dimensions, mass relations, properties of gases, vapour pressure, psychrometry, crystallization, mass balance including recycle and bypass, energy balance and unsteady state operations. The second edition is now enriched with additional worked examples and exercises to give additional exposure and practice to students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0152ec998e38cb897ae23a509b56fb74035f0036","amp;dn":"Process+Calculations+2nd+ed+%28PHI%2C+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0152ec998e38cb897ae23a509b56fb74035f0036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,82,236,153,142,56,203,137,122,226,58,80,155,86,251,116,3,95,0,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
