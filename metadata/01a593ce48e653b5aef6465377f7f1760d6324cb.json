Lead singer Freddie Garrity (born November 14, 1940) began playing in skiffle groups in the late '50s, switching to rock &amp; roll in the early '60s. After the Beatles broke the American market wide open, Freddie &amp; the Dreamers followed in the flood of acts that tried to duplicate the overwhelming success of the Beatles. The group's hits were more numerous in the U.K. than in America, where they had only one Top Ten hit, the number one &quot;I'm Telling You Now.&quot; As 1965 turned into 1966, the group stopped charting in the U.S. and the hits began to dwindle in the U.K.; by 1968 the original group disbanded. Garrity continues to tour with a new version of the Dreamers.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqe5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqe5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere is a listing, but no review here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3nfpxqudldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3nfpxqudldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KPPT60&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KPPT60&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
