This unclear prose was a &quot;contagion&quot; which had spread even to those who had no intent to hide the truth, and it concealed a writer's thoughts from himself and others. Orwell advocates instead Plain English.\n\nPublished 1946\n\nPDF\n\n9 Pages\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d4621c81fb0a8155ce640ce3849ecc0fd59641","amp;dn":"George+Orwell+-+Politics+and+the+English+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d4621c81fb0a8155ce640ce3849ecc0fd59641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,212,98,28,129,251,10,129,85,206,100,12,227,132,158,204,15,213,150,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
