But seeding an uncompressed audio  was a pain in the butt for everyone.\nSo, it has been taken care of. Sound quality has been improved through denoising,\nmost of the 'tape noise' has been removed, then encoded with Ogg Vorbis Q2.\n\nTape 2 and 3 were copied, recorded and transoded by a generous - but actually\nnever seen - friend. He made directly MP3s from the tapes and I was in\nno position to complain. They are as is, quality is not that bad, anyway.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d6a4f566fbbb3eb9229abdb2dd83d2599c1421","amp;dn":"Japanese+For+Everyone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d6a4f566fbbb3eb9229abdb2dd83d2599c1421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,214,164,245,102,251,187,62,185,34,154,189,178,221,131,210,89,156,20,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
