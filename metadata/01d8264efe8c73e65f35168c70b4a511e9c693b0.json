So she decided to do what surprised many -- including herself: she decided to write about it, to tell her own story, in her own words.\n\n\nAnd now, in this intimate memoir, she explores the highs and lows of her life, both in front of the camera and behind closed doors, revealing the real Jennie Garth -- smart, funny, and stronger than she ever realized.\n\n\nThis is one unforgettable, utterly loveable Hollywood Blonde, and these are her deep thoughts.\n\n\nAuthor:\n======\n\nJennie Garth is an actress, writer, and director. She lives in Los Angeles with her daughters and their animals. \n\nEmily Heckman is a writer based in California.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114158-deep-thoughts-from-a-hollywood-blonde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114158-deep-thoughts-from-a-hollywood-blonde&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001259/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001259/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d8264efe8c73e65f35168c70b4a511e9c693b0","amp;dn":"Jennie+Garth+-+Deep+Thoughts+From+a+Hollywood+Blonde+%282014%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d8264efe8c73e65f35168c70b4a511e9c693b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,216,38,78,254,140,115,230,95,53,22,140,112,180,165,17,233,198,147,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
