Becky Bee's manual is a friendly guide to making your own earth structure, with chapters on design, foundations, floors, windows and doors, finishes, and of course, making glorious cob.\n&quot;I believe that building with cob is a way to recreate community and experience the joy of working together while taking back the right to build our own homes and look after our Mother Earth.&quot;\nShe loves doing something that makes sense in a world where lots of things don't. \n\nAbout the Author\n\nBecky Bee has built natural structures in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Central America, and Samoa. Her company Groundworks, has been at the forefront of the cob revival: building, teaching workshops, and hosting natural building symposiums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f0507b0d601bc6a23ba5a3d8813e0f13dab326","amp;dn":"Cob+Builder%5C%27s+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f0507b0d601bc6a23ba5a3d8813e0f13dab326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,240,80,123,13,96,27,198,162,59,165,163,216,129,62,15,19,218,179,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
