During this VTC course, students will learn how to build modern, scalable web applications. The focus here is on building web-enabled applications that employ Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Tag Libraries to exploit the services provided by Java 7. This course covers architectural design issues as well as specific coding models for Java Web Applications. Students will build an application that uses the following technologies: JavaServer Faces or JSF, Jquery, Ajax, Json, Servlets, JSP, and JSTL. Seasoned Java Developer David Saenz will demonstrate the power of Java Web Applications and why Java is favored in the industry to provide real world solutions. Source code is provided to implement and see real world web applications perform. The work files will allow you to deploy, test, and modify actual application logic.
