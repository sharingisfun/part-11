King live than the home of the blues, Chicago? This set recorded in November 1966 showcases King's guitar playing and vocals in a spirited and exciting live set with a band consisting of Kenneth Sands on trumpet, Bobby Forte on tenor saxophone, Duke Jethro on organ, Louis Satterfield on bass and Sonny Freeman on drums. Blues fans consider this one of King's best live recordings and among his best albums overall.\n\n\n By 1967, King had refined his singing and guitar style (which were always intertwined) to a fine point. What was just beginning to emerge during this period was King the showman, the singer with a story to tell his audience; sometimes a sad story, sometimes an angry one, occasionally even a downright mean one. Nowhere was this more apparent than in live performance. Here he's captured in concert in Chicago, home of the blues and the ideal place to testify to the congregation. From &quot;Tired of Your Jive&quot; to &quot;I Know What You're Puttin' Down&quot; to the unequivocal &quot;Baby Get Lost,&quot; B.B. lets his audience in on the ups and downs of romance in no uncertain terms, both through his impassioned vocals and characteristically stinging guitar. The effect is both cathartic and awe-inspiring.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Introduction\n 02 - Waitin' On You\n 03 - Introduction Pt. 2\n 04 - Gambler's Blues\n 05 - Tired Of Your Jive\n 06 - Night Life\n 07 - Buzz Me\n 08 - Don't Answer The Door\n 09 - Blind Love\n 10 - I Know What You're Puttin' Down\n 11 - Baby, Get Lost\n 12 - Gonna Keep On Loving You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:023d74b6bdc7c17c0de62f740eb20bc633610639","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+-+Blues+Is+King+%281967%29+%5B2015+_24-96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"023d74b6bdc7c17c0de62f740eb20bc633610639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,61,116,182,189,199,193,124,13,230,47,116,14,178,11,198,51,97,6,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
