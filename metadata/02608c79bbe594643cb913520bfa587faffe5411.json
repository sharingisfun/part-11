Opening with a expansive version of &quot;Summertime,&quot; Redman&amp;#039;s tone is both hearty and buoyant. With the tasteful accompaniment of Brad Mehldau on piano, Larry Grenadier on bass, and Brian Blade on drums, he covers a range of once-contemporary pop and rock classics including &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin,&quot; and even a tune by Prince. Using the tenor, alto, and soprano saxophones in his instrumental arsenal, Redman reveals a vibrant imagination while staying solidly within the mainstream of jazz. Embracing beautiful ballads like &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean&quot; and jaunty old compositions like &quot;Love for Sale,&quot; Joshua Redman exhibits discerning taste in his chosen selections and distinctive playing style. \n\nPersonnel:\nJoshua Redman -saxophone\nBrad Mehldau - piano\nLarry Grenadier -double bass\nBrian Blade -drums\n\nTrack listing:\n   1. &quot;Summertime&quot; (George Gershwin)\n   2. &quot;Interlude 1&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n   3. &quot;Visions&quot; (Stevie Wonder)\n   4. &quot;Yesterdays&quot; (Jerome Kern)\n   5. &quot;Interlude 2&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n   6. &quot;I Had a King&quot; (Joni Mitchell)\n   7. &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&quot; (Bob Dylan)\n   8. &quot;Interlude 3&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n   9. &quot;It Might as Well Be Spring&quot; (Rodgers-Hammerstein)\n  10. &quot;Interlude 4&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n  11. &quot;How Deep is the Ocean&quot; (Irving Berlin)\n  12. &quot;Interlude 5&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n  13. &quot;Love For Sale&quot; (Cole Porter)\n  14. &quot;Interlude 6&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n  15. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; (Lennon-McCartney)\n  16. &quot;Interlude 7&quot; (Joshua Redman)\n  17. &quot;How Come U Don&amp;#039;t Call Me Anymore?&quot; (Prince)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02608c79bbe594643cb913520bfa587faffe5411","amp;dn":"Joshua+Redman+-+Timeless+Tales%28For+Changing+Times%291998+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02608c79bbe594643cb913520bfa587faffe5411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,96,140,121,187,229,148,100,60,185,19,82,11,250,88,127,175,254,84,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
