This requires the student to read the problem and truly comprehend exactly what is being asked before any solution can be attempted. In addition to this, the concepts in probability are usually completely foreign to the students as they begin class. The result is that students usually have an uneasy feeling when beginning to study probability. This DVD is guaranteed to improve your understanding is essential for any student taking Probability and Statistics at the high school or university level.\n\nThis DVD set is very comprehensive at 10 hours long so you can be assured that the topics are covered in detail. All topics are taught by fully worked example problems which helps the student improve problem solving skills immediately. This DVD set also serves as a reference as students work homework problems - offering practical advice every step of the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02a949d4722dbb74607eda34f0f70478d3b4854e","amp;dn":"The+Probability+and+Statistics+Tutor+-+Jason+Gibson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02a949d4722dbb74607eda34f0f70478d3b4854e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,169,73,212,114,45,187,116,96,126,218,52,240,247,4,120,211,180,133,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
