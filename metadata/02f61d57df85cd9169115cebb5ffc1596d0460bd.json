The DC-10 crashed during an emergency landing at Sioux City Gateway Airport on July 19, 1989. 184 people survived, partly thanks to the ground rescue workers who had 40 minutes to prepare for the event. The local community had also previously performed a large-scale emergency drill for such an event.\n\nOne of my favourites since 1996, and it is a scandal that this exciting film with such an experienced cast has not been published on DVD in the U.S. However, I incidentally found out that it has been released on DVD in Spain, and immediately bought a copy.\n\nThe picture quality of this rare, old film is not great on the DVD, but the story all the more exciting. The film even runs a little unevenly in the very beginning.\n\nDVDrip, original color fullscreen and mono sound.\n\nP.S. for the interested: \nThe cause of the disaster was an explosion in the middle (tail) engine that severed all hydraulic lines so that all hydraulic power was lost. To avoid similar situations, the producer later installed reduction valves. \nThe pilots managed to control the plane by applying different thrust on the remaining left and right engines. This technique was fed into flight simulators and later helped pilots in similar distress.\n\nThe ill-fated DC-10 had several major crashes due to a strange combination of errors in construction (cargo door), the General Electric engines and bad maintenance routines by the airlines. I flew with the plane several times before this was known, and found it very comfortable and spacious.\n\nWith its successor MD-11 which looked almost identical, McDonnell Douglas had corrected the errors, but also this plane proved to be ill-fated, especially with the Swissair Flight 111 on September 2, 1998 crashing into the ocean outside Halifax on its way from New York to Geneva. The cause of the crash was determined to be a fire caused by improper wiring of Swissair-added passenger entertainment system units.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.airdisaster.com/special/special-ua232.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.airdisaster.com/special/special-ua232.shtml&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-11#Accidents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-11#Accidents&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f61d57df85cd9169115cebb5ffc1596d0460bd","amp;dn":"Crash+Landing%3A+The+Rescue+of+Flight+232+%281992%29%5BTrue+DC-10+crash%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f61d57df85cd9169115cebb5ffc1596d0460bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,246,29,87,223,133,205,145,105,17,92,235,181,255,193,89,109,4,96,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
