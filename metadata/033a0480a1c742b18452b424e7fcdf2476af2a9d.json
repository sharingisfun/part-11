A great deal of the story credits go to Floyd, as well. Most of the inks in this volume were done by Ted Thwaites. \n\n&quot;Oh, for gosh sakes!&quot; Floyd Gottfredson's classic 1930s Mickey Mouse is back for another round of thrills, chills, and epic quests - taking him from the depths of teeming jungles to the halls of spooky Blaggard Castle. Mickey's classic Disney bad guys are here, too, with arch-enemy Pegleg Pete joined for this book by the mysterious &quot;Bill Shakespeare&quot; and hypnosis-happy Professors Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex!\n\nFloyd Gottfredson, artist of Mickey Mouse from 1930-1975, made it the most popular cartoon-based comic of its time. Unafraid to tackle social satire and grown-up action-adventure, Gottfredson produced a Mouse for all ages - truly popular in a way that Mickey's blander 1950s image could never be.\n\nIn this book you'll relive Mickey's fight with pirates on desolate Treasure Island; his quest with Goofy to catch ruthless counterfeiters; and his battles to save windy Horace Horsecollar from mad scientists, a robbery frame- up Ã¢â‚¬â€ and himself!\n\nLovingly restored from Disney's original negatives and proof sheets, &quot;Mickey Mouse: Trapped on Treasure Island&quot; also includes more than 50 pages of fascinating supplementary features. You'll enjoy rare behind-the-scenes art, vintage publicity material, and vivid commentary by a full team of seasoned Disney scholars.\n\nWalt Disney often said that his studio's success &quot;all started with a mouse&quot; - and today Mickey is among the world's most recognizable icons in the world. Now it's time to rediscover the wild, unforgettable personality behind the icon: Floyd Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033a0480a1c742b18452b424e7fcdf2476af2a9d","amp;dn":"Mickey+Mouse+Vol+2+Trapped+on+Treasure+Island","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033a0480a1c742b18452b424e7fcdf2476af2a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,58,4,128,161,199,66,177,132,82,180,36,231,252,223,36,118,175,42,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
