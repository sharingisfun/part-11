She chronicles the many accomplishments in America of Chinese immigrants and their descendents: building the infrastructure of their adopted country, fighting racist and exclusionary laws, walking the racial tightrope between black and white, contributing to major scientific and technological advances, expanding the literary canon, and influencing the way we think about racial and ethnic groups. Interweaving political, social, economic, and cultural history, as well as the stories of individuals, Chang offers a bracing view not only of what it means to be Chinese American, but also of what it is to be American. \n\nApril 2003\nPublisher: Viking Adult\nFormat: Hardcover , 448pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038292d2d643fc274c930245d270d423b07498ea","amp;dn":"The+Chinese+in+America+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038292d2d643fc274c930245d270d423b07498ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,130,146,210,214,67,252,39,76,147,2,69,210,112,212,35,176,116,152,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
