Count Basie Plays Joe Williams Sings Standards\nYear: 1957\nLabel: Verve (1991)\nTotal time: 35:21\nBitrate: 320 kbps\n\nI first bought the reel-to-reel version of this album in 1963.  It is now 43 years since, and finally, found a copy of it on cd.  Without a doubt, the quintessential combination of Joe Williams' voice and Count Basie's band are beyond comparison.  &quot;Standards&quot; sung and played the way they should have been.  No &quot;gimmicks,&quot; etc.  Just plain, honest and musically incomparable renditions of these songs.  It was a sad day for me, when it was announced that, Williams and Basie would no longer appear and record together again.  Even sadder is the loss of both of these &quot;GIANTS&quot; within the Jazz and music world.  I miss both of them beyond comprehension.  This is a MUST recording to include in your musical library.  ~ Tony Page, Amazon. com\n\nHow does Joe like singing with the Basie crew behind him? Well, Joe once put it this way to an interviewer: &quot;When I'm finished with a song, I don't feel like taking a solo bow - I just say 'we' instead of 'I' when I talk to the audience. . .  This is a group effort and Basie is the greatest. &quot; And how does the Count feel about his singing star? &quot;My boy, Joe&quot; says Basie, &quot;is the kind of singer that comes along once in a generation.  Joe Williams is the greatest. &quot; ~ from the original liner notes\n\nPersonnel:\nCount Basie (Piano and Organ) \nJoe Williams (Vocals) \nFrank Wess (Tenor Saxophone and Flute) \nBill Graham (Alto Saxophone) \nMarshall Royal (Alto Saxophone and Clarinet) \nFrank Foster (Tenor Saxophone) \nCharlie Fowlkes (Baritone Saxophone) \nThad Jones, Reunald Jones, Wendell Culley, Joe Newman (Trumpet) \nBill Hughes, Henry Coker, Ben Powell (Trombone) \nFreddie Green (Guitar) \nEddie Jones (Double Bass) \nSonny Payne (Drums) \nBuddy Bregman (Arranger) \n\nCount Basie &amp; Joe Williams Tracks:\n01  Thou Swell (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 2:22 \n02  There Will Never Be Another You (Harry Warren/Mack Gordon) 2:54 \n03  Our Love Is Here To Stay (George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin) 3:41 \n04  'S Wonderful (George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin) 2:38 \n05  My Baby Just Cares (Walter Donaldson/Gus Kahn) 2:27 \n06  Nevertheless (Bert Kalmar/Harry Ruby) 3:57 \n07  Singin' In The Rain (Nacio Herb Brown/Arthur Freed) 2:28 \n08  I'm Beginning To See The Light (Duke Ellington/Don George/Johnny Hodges/Harry James) 3:08 \n09  A Fine Romance (Dorothy Fields/Jerome Kern) 2:31 \n10  Come Rain Or Come Shine (Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer) 4:01 \n11  I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me (Clarence Gaskill/Jimmy McHugh) 2:41 \n12  This Can't Be Love (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 2:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:039af2747686a72ac6e2c9acd7f507564ec90130","amp;dn":"Count+Basie+%26+Joe+Williams+-+The+Greatest%21+%281957%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"039af2747686a72ac6e2c9acd7f507564ec90130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,154,242,116,118,134,167,42,198,226,201,172,215,245,7,86,78,201,1,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
