Mia Doi Todd grew up in a creative household; her father, Michael Todd, is a sculptor of note, and her mother, Kathryn Doi Todd, is an Associate Justice in the California Court of Appeals as well as a patron of the arts who has helped bring traditional Japanese dance and theater troupes to Los Angeles. As a child, Mia became involved in theater and choral performance, and she studied classical vocal technique. As a teenager, she began writing songs, influenced by the work of the Beatles, Leonard Cohen, and particularly Joni Mitchell, and her work developed a keener focus when she moved east to attend Yale University and became interested in indie rock. \n\nAlbums: \n\nCome Out of Your Mine - 1999\n\nThe Golden State - 2002\n\nManzanita - 2005\n\nLa Ninja - 2006\n\nGEA - 2008\n\nMorning Music - 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c57d52b667eaaabea0c967c277e26237d8f66e","amp;dn":"Mia+Doi+Todd+-+6+Albums+%281999-2009%29+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c57d52b667eaaabea0c967c277e26237d8f66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,197,125,82,182,103,234,170,190,160,201,103,194,119,226,98,55,216,246,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
