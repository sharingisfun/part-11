This program resembles L. Spiro's &quot;Memory Hacking Software&quot;, TSearch, and ArtMoney. It searches for values input by the user with a wide variety of options that allow the user to find and sort through the computer's memory. Cheat Engine can also create standalone trainers that can operate independently of Cheat Engine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e95814c82d43b1514cdaa6346e734fe7dbddf1","amp;dn":"Cheat+Engine+5.6.1+%28MAC%29%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e95814c82d43b1514cdaa6346e734fe7dbddf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,233,88,20,200,45,67,177,81,76,218,166,52,110,115,79,231,219,221,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
