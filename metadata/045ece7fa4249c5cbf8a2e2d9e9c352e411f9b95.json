Indeed, their status is remarkably similar to that of the Monkees and it's not a coincidence that both groups' music was intended to appeal to younger teenagers. The difference is that as early as 1976, the Monkees began to be considered cool by people who really knew music; it has taken 35 years for Herman's Hermits to begin receiving higher regard for their work. Of course, that lack of respect had no relevance to their success: 20 singles lofted into the Top 40 in England and America between 1964 and 1970, 16 of them in the Top 20, and most of those Top Ten as well. Artistically, they were rated far lower than the Hollies, the Searchers, or Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, but commercially, the Hermits were only a couple of rungs below the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/hermans-hermits-p4476/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/hermans-hermits-p4476/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nBritish budget reissue label Prism Leisure licensed the material on this live compilation from Marathon Music, and while it does not contain any of Herman's Hermits' original 1960s studio recordings, fans may be happy to know that it does feature lead singer Peter Noone. (A Noone-less version of the band has toured and recorded.) Prism deceives potential customers by using photographs of the original band from the '60s in the package when the recordings clearly were made decades later. But by using the subtitle &quot;The Concert Collection&quot; on the cover, the label acknowledges that these are live recordings. Noone remains in good voice, and he is an engaging frontman as he runs through many of the group's big hits. Also included are several other people's hits and a few songs dating from Noone's '80s band the Tremblers. Of course, albums of the original Herman's Hermits hits are preferable, but those who already have those records might enjoy hearing what Noone's oldies shows sound like. And they may be relieved to hear that the singer really is on the album. It could have been worse, and it has been!\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfpxqeald0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfpxqeald0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004T2C4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004T2C4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
