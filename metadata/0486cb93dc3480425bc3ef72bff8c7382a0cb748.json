With our recipes, anyone can prepare delicious and sophisticated, yet surprisingly simple dishes that will impress fussy in-laws, placate implacable bosses, and seduce sexy strangers through the proven method of knocking their socks off at the dinner table.\n\nAs the lazy gourmets themselves like to say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCooking a great meal can be just as easy as cooking a crappy meal!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So relax!
