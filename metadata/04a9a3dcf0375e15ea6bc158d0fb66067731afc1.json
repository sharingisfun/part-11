This had the effect of the UK that the &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast did in America.  The movie is intense, and scares you on a psychological level.  I've had a hard time finding it, and did a while back, now letting everybody see.  You have to watch this movie, at least once.\n\nOriginal airing: October 31, 1992 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200659/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200659/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a9a3dcf0375e15ea6bc158d0fb66067731afc1","amp;dn":"Ghostwatch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a9a3dcf0375e15ea6bc158d0fb66067731afc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,169,163,220,240,55,94,21,234,107,193,88,208,251,102,6,119,49,175,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
