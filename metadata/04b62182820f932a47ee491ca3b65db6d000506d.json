DVD9 game backups\n      may need a different way to get working such as using a hard drive and\n      a dvd9 loader or something along those lines, to work on a ps2 console.\n      I guess of course if all else fails find a dvd5 ripped version or\n      Just buy this game it's cheap.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - This is the DVD9 version, As far as if you have a\n                mod-chipped ps2 it must support DVD9 Backups and you\n                gotta find a DVD DL disc that you can run. If you\n                Can't run this game using all methods Just use the \n                emulator provided. For some reason DVD9 backups can \n                be tricky to get working, but here's the full game \n                ripped probably.\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nExperience the intense, fast speed of open street racing with the latest in customization.
