Which is why Riki is now on TWO special missions. The not\nso secret one: recruiting new members so the Busters can form a baseball team. Preferably FEMALE recruits, as the current dude/babe\nratio is an inconvenient 4 to 1. The OTHER mission, though... That's the strange one. Because Riki and Rin, the group's singular girl, are\nreceiving odd messages, delivered by cats, concerning the existence of a &quot;secret world&quot; and assigning them tasks they have to complete.\nWere their youthful dreams of being crusaders not so fanciful after all? Or is there something even more vital at stake? Between steeling\nhis courage to talk to girls, dealing with his own narcolepsy and facing his feelings concerning Rin, Riki may just need the strength of a\nsuperhero to solve the ultimate mystery of the Little Busters!\n\nVIDEO\n- Video Source: BD-J\n- Video Codec: H.264/AVC\n- Video Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\n- Video FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\n- Codec: AAC\n- Track 1: English: Stereo\n- Track 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\n- Track 1: English Signs/Songs\n- Track 2: English Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bcd66d0e2a4d4098c60dfe540bb9b2e1ef3a1b","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Little+Busters%21+1-26+Complete+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-720p-8bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bcd66d0e2a4d4098c60dfe540bb9b2e1ef3a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,188,214,109,14,42,77,64,152,198,13,254,84,11,185,178,225,239,58,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
