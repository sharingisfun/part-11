Granger plays the famed 18th-century dandy and social arbiter who rises from poverty to become the adviser and severest critic of the Prince of Wales (marvelously portrayed as a self-involved neurotic by Peter Ustinov). Secure in his station in life, Brummell goes one step too far when he jokes about the Prince's obesity. The future King George IV will forget the whole thing if Brummell will apologize, but the haughty trendsetter refuses to do so. Brummell is banished from court, losing everything -- including his chance at finding happiness with the aristocratic Elizabeth Taylor -- in the process. Filmed on location in England, Beau Brummell was based on the same war-horse play by Clyde Fitch that had served as the inspiration for the 1924 Brummell starring John Barrymore.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046759/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046759/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4007949/beau-brummell-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4007949/beau-brummell-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:46:56\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x464 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1248 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 58 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04f7a65af5130c74c63b818451d7f8e463096acb","amp;dn":"Beau+Brummell+%281954%29+Elizabeth+Taylor+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04f7a65af5130c74c63b818451d7f8e463096acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,247,166,90,245,19,12,116,198,59,129,132,81,215,248,228,99,9,106,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
