Evidence can be found for its nutritional and medicinal use beginning with prehistoric and ancient civilizations. Currently, there is a resurgence of scientific interest in natural medicinal products, such as honey, by researchers, the medical community, and even the general public. Honey in Traditional and Modern Medicine provides a detailed compendium on the medical uses of honey, presenting its enormous potential and its limitations.\nThe book covers honeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethnomedicinal uses, chemical composition, and physical properties. It discusses the healing properties of honey, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. It also examines the botanical origin of honey, a critical factor in relation to its medicinal use, along with the complex subject of the varying composition of honey. HoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s antibacterial qualities and other attributes are described in a chapter dedicated to Leptospermum, or Manuka honey, a unique honey with potential for novel therapeutic applications.\nChapters explore a variety of medicinal uses for honey, including its healing properties and use in burn and wound management. They review honeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beneficial effects on medical conditions, such as gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetic ulcers, and cancers as well as in pediatrics and animal health and wellness. The book also examines honey-based formulations, modern methods for chemical analysis of honey, and the history and reality of &quot;mad honey.&quot; The final chapters cover honey in the food industry, as a nutrient, and for culinary use.\n\nAbout the Author\nLaÃƒÂ¯d BoukraÃƒÂ¢, DVM, MSc, PhD, associate professor, is a veterinary surgeon who did his postgraduate studies in microbiology at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Montreal University in Quebec, Canada.
