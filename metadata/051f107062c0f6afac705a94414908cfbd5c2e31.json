Don't Say a Word was directed by Gary Fleder and written by Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly.\n\nMichael Douglas as Dr. Nathan R. Conrad \nBrittany Murphy as Elisabeth Burrows \nSean Bean as Patrick Koster \nSkye McCole Bartusiak as Jessie Conrad \nGuy Torry as Dolen \nJennifer Esposito as Det. Sandra Cassidy \nShawn Doyle as Russel Maddox \nVictor Argo as Sydney Simon \nConrad Goode as Max Dunlevy \nPaul Schulze as Jake \nLance Reddick as Arnie \nFamke Janssen as Agatha &quot;Aggie&quot; Conrad \nOliver Platt as Dr. Louis Sachs \nAidan Devine as Leon Edward Croft \nAlex Campbell as Jonathan \n\nMuch of the filming was, for cost reasons, undertaken in Canada. The Canal Street subway station was actually filmed in a set constructed in Toronto's unused Lower Bay subway station, with columns, beams, mosaics and dressing covering all the existing surfaces. The Toronto Transit Commission was so impressed with the work of American production designer Nelson Coates' conversion to the New York subway that it requested the set to be left up after filming was completed to attract future filming revenue; however, fire inspectors deemed its long term installation hazardous, so it was taken down three weeks later.\n\nThe final scenes of the film, which are set in Potter's Field on Hart Island and located east of Manhattan in the Long Island Sound, were filmed indoors in an enormous warehouse, with more than 4,000 tons of earth, 38 mature trees, 180,000 leaves, three buildings and 126 graves, as well as a collapsing 50'x10'x8' grave trench. Unlike the movie version, the real Hart Island Potter's Field has no individual grave markers. An air conditioning system and misting machines were installed to create visible breath.\n\nSurveillance and technology feature heavily in the film, so much so that in characterization the shot of Bean speaking to Douglas and Janssen on the cell phone was real. In one scene, Janssen's character plays with a Game Boy, a skill taught to her by Skye McCole Bartusiak.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:051f107062c0f6afac705a94414908cfbd5c2e31","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+Say+a+Word+%5B2001%5D+Gary+Fleder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"051f107062c0f6afac705a94414908cfbd5c2e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,31,16,112,98,192,246,175,172,112,90,148,65,73,8,207,189,92,46,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
