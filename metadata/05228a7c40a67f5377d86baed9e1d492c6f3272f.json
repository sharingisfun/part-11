Creating and printing exams and quizes is now a lot easier than ever!\n\n\nTest makes a time-consuming chore a whole lot easier and the result considerably more professional. Some of our customers have even hinted that creating tests with Schoolhouse Test can actually be an enjoyable process.\n\nCreate your first test in minutes\nAnd Schoolhouse Test is surprisingly easy to use and very intuitive. It incorporates three views or work areas depending on the current task. You use the design view to construct your test, the document view to format the test and see exactly what it will look like when printed, and the answer sheet view to format the answer sheet and see what it will look like when printed, if you have opted to use an answer sheet that is.\n\nSave paper and cut marking time\nOne of the more popular features of Schoolhouse Test is the answer sheet. You can automatically create an answer sheet for students to record their answers on and save the actual test document for future use. Saves paper and photocopier costs. The answer sheet also makes for easy marking. Simply place a student answer sheet on top of the answer key on a lighted surface (such as an overhead projector) and you can score an entire test in seconds.\n\nOne test, different questions\nOne of the top time-saving features in the design view is the option to activate and deactivate questions. You can, for example, design a master test with 100 questions but only use selected questions at a given time, turning them on and off as the situation demands.\n\nOr same questions, different tests\nAnother time-saving feature in the design view is the randomize function. You can, with a just a couple of mouse clicks, randomize all the selected questions in the test so that they are in a different order. You can even randomize elements within questions. So you can generate many different tests using the same question set.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here\nLOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE\n                                                                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                                                                                                                                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1550+ Torrents                                                                                                                                                                                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\t\t\t\ncredit to the original creator encoder \t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05228a7c40a67f5377d86baed9e1d492c6f3272f","amp;dn":"Schoolhouse.Technologies.Schoolhouse.Test.v3.1.14.0-BEAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05228a7c40a67f5377d86baed9e1d492c6f3272f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,34,138,124,64,166,127,83,119,216,107,174,217,225,212,146,198,243,39,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
