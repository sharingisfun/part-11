In 1999, Refactoring revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly anticipated Refactoring to Patterns, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring.\nThis book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055d94885482c70e4492ed7a4aec8a86bd33c86b","amp;dn":"Refactoring+To+Patterns-+Joshua+Kerievsky+v1.13.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055d94885482c70e4492ed7a4aec8a86bd33c86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,93,148,136,84,130,199,14,68,146,237,122,74,236,138,134,189,51,200,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
