It's free, does a great job and can utilize your dual or quadruple or whatever core through multithreading.\n\nEnjoy : )\n\nH&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0579760ef068d63b69ccf9c4e9cfbbbc863da744","amp;dn":"Bruckner+-+Symphonies+3-9+%2B+-+Celibidache+-+flac+%28lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0579760ef068d63b69ccf9c4e9cfbbbc863da744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,121,118,14,240,104,214,59,105,204,249,196,233,207,187,188,134,61,167,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
