Sneak peeks are shown for some of the ads for 2014 and behind-the-scenes footage from this year's Volkswagen commercial. Also, the five finalists for Doritos' Crash The Super Bowl contest are briefly interviewed and their entries are shown.\n\nThis aired on CBS HD on Jan 29, 2014. The quality is something like A8 V8 since it was recorded using analog methods.  \n\nYou can leave me comments at kickass or thepiratebay.\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Super.Bowls.Greatest.Commercials.2014.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            524,320,768 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             44:10.975\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            29.970 fps\nBitrate:              1445 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              128 kbps\nBitrate Type:         CBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b56dc9a506f84cb7f6ff8f94777e519f101124","amp;dn":"Super+Bowls+Greatest+Commercials+2014+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b56dc9a506f84cb7f6ff8f94777e519f101124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,181,109,201,165,6,248,76,183,246,255,143,148,119,126,81,159,16,17,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
