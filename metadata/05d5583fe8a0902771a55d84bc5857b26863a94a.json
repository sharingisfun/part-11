Guera mixed crime and Native American culture in &quot;Scalped.&quot; The series begins with undercover agent Dashell &quot;Dash&quot; Bad Horse as he returned home to Prairie Rose Reservation to infiltrate the tribal leader's criminal organisation. Hired to be a cop by the reservation, Dash soon found himself caught up in the reservation's problems and became conflicted between life as an FBI agent and as a tribe member. &quot;Scalped&quot; remains a brutal noir thriller that is not scared to reflect the grim reality of life for many modern-day Native Americans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d5583fe8a0902771a55d84bc5857b26863a94a","amp;dn":"Scalped+%28%2301-60%29+%28Jason+Aaron%29+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d5583fe8a0902771a55d84bc5857b26863a94a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,213,88,63,232,160,144,39,113,165,93,132,188,88,87,178,104,99,169,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
