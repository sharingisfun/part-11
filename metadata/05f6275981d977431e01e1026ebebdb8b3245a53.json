In the latter year he moved to Goes, where he died around 1546. He is also named Marinus de Seeu (from Zeeland, a province of the Netherlands). He studied at the University of Leuven (1504) and was trained as a painter in Antwerp (1509). His name is known from a small number of signed panels. A number of other paintings are attributed to Marinus on stylistic grounds.
