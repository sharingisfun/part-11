There are four of her in this, including the dressed down scientist real life one.  Glasses were always a symbol, if only that, of homeliness (or perhaps braininess...in men). Their dance sequences show a lack of rhythm, but that's not surprising, they're told to act more robotic.\n\nA couple of Hal Hartley mainstays, James Urbaniak and Thomas Jay Ryan, as well as a mumbling Jeremy Davies fill out the staff. Oh, and Karen Black!\n\nThe director, Lynn Hershman-Leeson, is also responsible for &quot;Conceiving Ada&quot; and &quot;Strange Culture&quot;, also starring Tilda.\n\nThere is a director's commentary and some trailers.  The film itself is but 82 minutes.\n\nUncompressed DVD5 VIDEO_TS files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0615ca6ea74df095d045a1a1625c9e3eb5dbab76","amp;dn":"Tilda+Swinton+-+Karen+Black+-+Teknolust+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0615ca6ea74df095d045a1a1625c9e3eb5dbab76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,21,202,110,167,77,240,149,208,69,161,161,98,92,158,62,181,219,171,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
