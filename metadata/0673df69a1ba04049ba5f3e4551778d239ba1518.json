With no prior knowledge of the subject assumed, the opening chapters offer a broad overview of the basics of fungal biology, in particular the physiology and genetics of fungi and also a new chapter on the application of genomics to fungi.  Later chapters move on to include more detailed coverage of topics such as antibiotic and chemical commodities from fungi, new chapters on biotechnological use of fungal enzymes and fungal proteomics, and fungal diseases of humans, antifungal agents for use in human therapy and fungal pathogens of plants.\n\n \n# Paperback: 376 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley; 2 edition (December 20, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0470977094\n# ISBN-13: 978-0470977095","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0673df69a1ba04049ba5f3e4551778d239ba1518","amp;dn":"Fungi%3A+Biology+and+Applications%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0673df69a1ba04049ba5f3e4551778d239ba1518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,115,223,105,161,186,4,4,155,165,243,228,85,23,120,210,57,186,21,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
