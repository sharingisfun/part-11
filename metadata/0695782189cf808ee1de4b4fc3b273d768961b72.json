Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975) has given us some of the most distinct film scores of any composer. As the lists of titles show, Herrmann did a number of Alfred Hitchcock movies--Psycho, Marnie, North by Northwest, Vertigo, and Torn Curtain. What is remarkable is how these works cohere as atmospheric tone poems. Fahrenheit 451: Suite for Strings, Harps, and Percussion has the same kind of atmospherics as some of Arnold Bax's tone poems of the 1930s. This music does not need a visual medium. It's that good. --Paul Cook\n\nHermann was one of the great film music composers of all time, and his scores fit naturally into a great and illustrious tradition, nowhere more so than in this award-winning recording. --David Hurwitz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0695782189cf808ee1de4b4fc3b273d768961b72","amp;dn":"Bernard+Herrmann%3A+The+Film+Scores","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0695782189cf808ee1de4b4fc3b273d768961b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,149,120,33,137,207,128,142,225,222,75,79,195,178,115,215,104,150,27,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
