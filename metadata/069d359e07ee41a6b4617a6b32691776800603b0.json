THE 1ST DIDN'T SEED CORRECTLY.\n\n\nThe Case Against The Case For Christ: A New Testament Scholar Refutes the Reverend Lee Strobel (2010)\n\nLeading New Testament scholar Robert M. Price has taken umbrage at the cavalier manner in which Rev. Lee Strobel has misrepresented the field of Bible scholarship in his book The Case for Christ. Price exposes and refutes Strobels arguments chapter-by-chapter. In doing so he has occasion to wipe out the entire field of Christian apologetics as summarized by Strobel. This book is a must-read for anyone bewildered by the various books published by Rev. Strobel.\n\nThis book is not available as an EPUB or MOBI, so I had it digitized into PDF. Included is my calibre metadata.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:069d359e07ee41a6b4617a6b32691776800603b0","amp;dn":"The+Case+Against+The+Case+For+Christ+-+Robert+M.+Price+%28New%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"069d359e07ee41a6b4617a6b32691776800603b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,157,53,158,7,238,65,166,180,97,122,107,50,105,23,118,128,6,3,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
