It belongs to my cousin &amp; I used it extensively during my junior college days in the 80's. The syllabus has undergone many changes now but the topics are equally useful even today! You can use this book in conjuction with another one that I had scanned &amp; uploaded a few months back called 'Teach Yourself Algebra'.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Sets .... 1\n2 Real Numbers ..... 43\n3 Complex Numbers 79\n4 Indices (Exponents) ... 92\n5 Logarithms ... 115\n6 Surds ... 141\n7 Quadratic Equations ... 177\n8 Method of Induction ...213\n9 Progressions ... 222\n10 Summation of Series  ... 265\n11 Permutations and Combinations ... 280\n12 Binomial Theorem ... 307\n13 Determinants ... 325\nAppendix\n1 Logarithmic and Anti-logarithmic Tables ... 355\n2 Important Formulae and Results ... 359\n3 Test Papers ... 369 \nBombay University Papers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a86eeb44a4915ba338bbcb1a641a6ae7eba980","amp;dn":"College+Algebra+%289th+Ed%29%281973%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a86eeb44a4915ba338bbcb1a641a6ae7eba980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,168,110,235,68,164,145,91,163,56,187,203,26,100,26,106,231,235,169,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
