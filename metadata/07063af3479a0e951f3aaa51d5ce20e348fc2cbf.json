His occasional reunions with \nStephen Stills, Graham Nash, and sometimes Neil Young get the most \nattention, but he also appeared on David Gilmour's 2006 album On an Island \nand, more notably, often worked with his son James Raymond on a band \ncalled CPR. Raymond is David's chief collaborator on Croz, a skillful evocation \nof Crosby's early-'70s haze as filtered through early-'90s professionalism. As \nalways, Crosby is supported by a cast of heavy-hitters, but where 1993's A \nThousand Roads sometimes seemed weighed down by cameos (an emphasis \non covers also helped shift the spotlight away from the man at the center), \nCroz is tastefully decorated with sly solos by Mark Knopfler and Wynton \nMarsalis, the focus forever remaining on Croz himself. At the age of 72, his \nvoice remains sweet, sometimes airy, and he and Raymond take advantage \nof both qualities, occasionally conjuring ghosts of CSN's early-'80s soft rock \n(&quot;Radio&quot; could easily have slipped onto Daylight Again), but usually allowing \nthe music to amiably drift and linger, sometimes settling in the conscious, \nsometimes dissipating. Even with songs as spare and haunting as &quot;If She \nCalled&quot; -- nothing more than an electric guitar and voice there -- Croz is too \ndedicated to tasty, in-the-pocket grooves and cleanly sculpted digital \nproduction to truly be an heir to If I Could Only Remember My Name, but it's \nthe only other solo record of Crosby's that attempts to reckon with similar \nemotions and sounds. That Croz prefers certainty to the untrammeled \nmelancholy of If I Could Only Remember My Name is a reflection of where he \nstands in 2014: he's aware he's building upon a past he sometimes pines for, \nyet he's restless enough to forage ahead into new territory, but only when \nhe's surrounded by cozy, familiar settings. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07063af3479a0e951f3aaa51d5ce20e348fc2cbf","amp;dn":"David+Crosby+-+Croz+%282014%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07063af3479a0e951f3aaa51d5ce20e348fc2cbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,6,58,243,71,154,14,149,31,58,170,81,213,206,32,227,72,252,44,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
