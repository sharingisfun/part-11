Songs 4 Worship Kids: Awesome God passes the test and is a worthwhile product for any parent seeking to expose their child to safe and quality music. Well recorded and arranged, the CD offers standard contemporary worship fare like &quot;Give Thanks,&quot; &quot;Change My Heart, O God,&quot; &quot;More Precious Than Silver,&quot; and &quot;Thy Word.&quot; The release also features a creative reworking of Rich Mullins's &quot;Awesome God,&quot; intersplicing choruses with Bible verses read by the children artists. &quot;Jesus Sees&quot; is another track that will speak to children in their own voice and language. The upbeat &quot;Every Move I Make&quot; is also a winner. There are a few dull moments that fall flat, like the too-adult &quot;Open the Eyes of My Heart.&quot; But for the most part, parents will be relieved to know that the CD is lively enough to keep kids' interest before they start wanting the latest Britney Spears, N'Sync, or Nelly release. --Michael Lyttle \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072de7a9bd2f64dc1ad2ae0a2f656ebcaef52e05","amp;dn":"Songs+4+Worship+Kids+-+2002+-+Vol+01+-+Awesome+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072de7a9bd2f64dc1ad2ae0a2f656ebcaef52e05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,45,231,169,189,47,100,220,26,210,174,10,47,101,110,188,174,245,46,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
