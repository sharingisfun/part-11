Step \ninto the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to \ndual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will \nbuild on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever \nimagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of \ncourse! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that's your thing! Want to try \nother styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose \nfrom!\nDynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both \nonline and via LAN.

On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to \nany other!\nWorld Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of \nPandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil\nsurrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a \nuniverse-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. \n(Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)\n87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust \nafter procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, \nmuch more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!\nBrand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of \nPandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the \ndangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you'll \nbe surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!\nBrand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in \nBorderlands 2.
