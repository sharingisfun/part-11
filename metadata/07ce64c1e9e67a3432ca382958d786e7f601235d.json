Among the people named in the file in connection with this group are President Franklin Roosevelt's Administrative Assistant Lauchlin Currie (Venona cover name &quot;Page&quot;) and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White (Venona cover names Ã¢â‚¬Å“LawyerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Ã¢â‚¬Å“JuristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; &quot;Richard&quot;).\n\nAlso named in the file are Victor Perlo (Venona cover name &quot;Raider&quot;), chief of the Aviation Section of the War Production Board, and contacts of his Perlo group, including Alger Hiss (Venona cover name Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), secretary general of the United Nations Charter Conference. (Like several others identified by Bentley, Hiss had been identified independently by another defecting Soviet courier, Whittaker Chambers, to Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle in 1939.) Among dozens of others named by Bentley in this file in connection with this network is Duncan Lee (Venona cover name Ã¢â‚¬Å“KochÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), confidential assistant to William Donovan, founder and director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), wartime predecessor of the CIA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ce64c1e9e67a3432ca382958d786e7f601235d","amp;dn":"FBI+Silvermaster+File%2C+150%2B+Volumes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ce64c1e9e67a3432ca382958d786e7f601235d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,206,100,193,233,230,122,52,50,202,56,41,88,215,134,231,246,1,35,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
