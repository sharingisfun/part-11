But a small group of people who control the bettings in town try to get advantage of his simple-mindedness.\n\n        I found this movie very entertaining. It's a nice, funny movie, and well produced, specially when compared to many films made in Brazil at that time. It's really a &quot;time capsule&quot; that allows the viewer to immerse himself in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Brazil, the 1950's. You can see the city of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo at the height of it's economic development, but in a moment of time in which the violence and urban deterioration of the present didn't exist; you can see the early days of television, the TV sets that appear in the movie are of the &quot;Invictus&quot; brand, the first Brazilian TV brand, and the TV studio scenes were shot at the studio of &quot;TV Tupi&quot; , the first South American TV station; you can hear the way people talked and the slangs used in Brazil at the time; see the early days of Rock and Roll. To the nostalgic crowd ( on which I include myself ), it's a movie that not only you must see, but also a movie that you must have in your collection.
