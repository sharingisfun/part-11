Carter views the shifting alliance entanglements of the Great Powers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and especially the growing animosity and rivalry between Britain and Germany, with particular focus on the attitudes and actions of three royal first cousins: Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and King George V of Great Britain (who also reigned as emperor of India, hence the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title reference to three emperors). Rich in concrete detail, elegant in style, and wise, fresh, and knowledgeable in interpretation, the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account observes a profound anachronism at play: that these three monarchs, in what they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize were the waning days of the institution of monarchy, handled foreign diplomacy as if it were a family business. Despite the reality of growing fissures separating their countries, Ã¢â‚¬Å“each emperor continued to paper over the cracks with cousinly gestures, each increasingly irrelevant.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Europe plunged over the precipice of war in August 1914, revealing in stark terms the inability of royal familial ties to control and contain national disagreements; as the author has it, the fact that Wilhelm, Nicholas, and George were out of touch with actual politics could not have been more apparent. An irresistible narrative for history buffs. --Brad Hooper\n\nReview\n\nPraise for Miranda Carter's George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Miranda Carter has written an engrossing and important book. While keeping her focus on the three cousins and their extended families, she skillfully interweaves and summarizes all important elements of how the war came aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Carter has given us an original book, highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ---_The Dallas Morning News_\n\n&quot;Masterfully crafted. . . Carter has presented one of the most cohesive explorations of the dying days of European royalty and the coming of political modernity. . . Carter has delivered another gem.&quot; --_Bookpage_\n\n&quot;Ms. Carter writes incisively about the overlapping events that led to the Great War and changed the world. . . George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm is an impressive book. Ms. Carter has clearly not bitten off more than she can chew for she -- as John Updike once wrote of Gunter Grass -- 'chews it enthusiastically before our eyes.'&quot; --The New York Times \n\n&quot;An irresistably entertaining and illuminating chronicle . . . Readers with fond memories of Robert Massie and Barbara Tuchman can expect similar pleasures in this witty, shrewd examination of the twilight of the great European monarchies.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;A wonderfully fresh and beautifully choreographed work of history.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Craig Brown, Mail on Sunday\n\n&quot;A hauntingly tempting proposition for a book . . . The parallel, interrelated lives of Kaiser Wilhelm II, George V, and Nicholas II are . . . a prism though which to tell the march to the first World War, the creation of the modern industrial world and the follies of hereditary courts and the eccentricities of their royal trans-European cousinhood . . . An entertaining and accessible study of power and personality.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Simon Sebag Montefiore, _Financial Times\n_\n&quot;Carter draws masterful portraits of her subjects and tells the complicated story of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s failing international relations well . . . A highly readable and well-documented account.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Margaret MacMillan, _The Spectator\n_\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put this book down. The whole thing really lives and breathes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very funny. That these three absurd men could ever have held the fate of Europe in their hands is a fact as hilarious as it is terrifying.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Zadie Smith\n\n&quot;[An] enterprising history of imperial vicissitudes and royal reversals.&quot; --The New York Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f0f7a539749252aaaab99fd48fe9b4aed4031c","amp;dn":"George%2C+Nicholas+and+Wilhelm+by+Miranda+Carter.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f0f7a539749252aaaab99fd48fe9b4aed4031c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,240,247,165,57,116,146,82,170,170,185,159,212,143,233,180,174,212,3,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
