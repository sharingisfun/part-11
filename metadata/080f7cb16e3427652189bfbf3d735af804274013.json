Now, with a single faultless shot, Harry Bosch thinks he has ended the city's nightmare.\n\nBut the dead man's widow is suing Harry and the LAPD for killing the wrong man - an accusation that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker's macabre signature.\n\nSo, for the second time, Harry must hunt down a death-dealer who is very much alive, before he strikes again. It's a blood-tracked quest that will take Harry from the hard edges of the L.A. night to the last place he ever wanted to go - the darkness of his own heart.\n\n\n--\n\nLength: 13:57:14\nNarrator: Dick Hill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080f7cb16e3427652189bfbf3d735af804274013","amp;dn":"Michael+Connelly+-+The+Concrete+Blonde+%28Harry+Bosch+3%29+%281994%29+Un","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080f7cb16e3427652189bfbf3d735af804274013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,15,124,177,110,52,39,101,33,137,191,191,61,115,90,248,4,39,64,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
