The book also examines the challenges the sector faces as it competes for influence and investment with the fossil fuel industry across the globe.\n\nThe wind power business has grown from a niche sector within the energy industry to a global industry attracting substantial investment in recent years. In Europe wind has become the biggest source of new power generation capacity, while wind is successfully competing with the gas, coal and nuclear sectors in China and the US.\n\nThe specialist wind turbine companies that pioneered the business have gone global over the last decade, while big industrial conglomerates have entered the fray. European companies are struggling to maintain their technological and market lead in the sector, in a three cornered battle with China and the US.\n\nMeanwhile, the industry is fighting to drive down costs in the face of a fossil fuel generation industry bolstered by the onset of cheap shale gas. And wind companies continue to wrestle with a stop-go cycle of investment across the world, with some traditional markets stuttering under the impact of the financial crisis and fiscal austerity, while new power hungry markets in Asia and South America emerge.\n\nWind Power Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Struggle for Control of a New Global Industry analyses the industry climbers, the investment trends and the technological advancements that will define the future of wind energy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0830290dcb2f9b5ffbb13adead64bd56be42fc58","amp;dn":"Wind+Power+-+The+Struggle+for+Control+of+a+New+Global+Industry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0830290dcb2f9b5ffbb13adead64bd56be42fc58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,48,41,13,203,47,155,95,251,177,58,222,173,100,189,86,190,66,252,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
