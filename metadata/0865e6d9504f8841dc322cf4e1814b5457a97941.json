It becomes important, therefore, for the designer to cultivate an aesthetic eye as well as develop a high degree of computer savvy.\n\nBy combining basic theory with hands-on technique, Digital Design for Print and Web takes the unique approach of uniting two subjects traditionally approached separately into one complete volume. As a result, you will gain a clearer understanding of the entire creative process, from project management to working with graphics to designing for print and, ultimately, the Web. In this book, you'll find:\n\n- Full-color text and illustrated, step-by-step instruction supported by more than 75 video tutorials\n- Coverage of professional software including the Adobe Creative Suite\n- A wide variety of inspirational images from well-known designers\n- Online full-length project assignments from entry level to advanced\n\nAn ideal resource for design students or practitioners, Digital Design for Print and Web will show you to how to create more effectively and guide you on the path toward digital design mastery.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 352 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (March 1, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470398361\nISBN-13: 978-0470398364","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0865e6d9504f8841dc322cf4e1814b5457a97941","amp;dn":"Digital+Design+For+Print+And+Web+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0865e6d9504f8841dc322cf4e1814b5457a97941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,101,230,217,80,79,136,65,220,50,44,244,225,129,75,84,87,169,121,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
