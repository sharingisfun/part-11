But he was also a fine singer and interpreter of traditional English and Scots folk music; his musical and marital partnership with Peggy Seeger produced some haunting and beautiful recordings, many of which are difficult or impossible to find -- hence the value of this generous 20-track collection. It features such classics as &quot;Dirty Old Town,&quot; &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; (performed here by Peggy Seeger in a style that seems archetypally American in its raw openness), as well as more obscure originals and traditional songs. &quot;Sheath and Knife&quot; is an a cappella tour de force, an ancient incest ballad delivered with an eerie combination of gravity and gusto; MacColl's &quot;Nobody Knew She Was There&quot; is a touching tribute to his mother and her life of invisible toil. MacColl sings in a voice that is both rich and reedy, and Seeger accompanies him skillfully on a variety of instruments. Their chemistry is like gravity, silently and invisibly holding the songs together and lending weight to the music. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0878f03f7d62475e8b22f053f14e80a20ef02957","amp;dn":"Ewan+Maccoll...Black+and+White%281986%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0878f03f7d62475e8b22f053f14e80a20ef02957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,120,240,63,125,98,71,94,139,34,240,83,241,78,128,162,14,240,41,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
