B. YEHOSHUA (b. 1936) is an internationally-acclaimed Israeli novelist, essayist, and playwright.  He became a notable figure in the &quot;new wave&quot; generation of Israeli writers who differed from earlier writers in their focus on the individual and interpersonal rather than the group.  His works have been published in translation in 28 countries, and many have been adapted for film, television, theatre, and opera.  He has won the National Jewish Book Award and the Koret Jewish Book Award in the U.S, and the Israel Prize for Hebrew literature.\n\nDescribed by The New York Times as &quot;a kind of Israeli Faulkner,&quot; Yehoshua's writing has a particular gift for capturing the mood of contemporary Israel.  In a style which has been called &quot;anti-stream of consciousness,&quot; he explores the animal instincts which threaten the facade of civilized people and examines their isolation from each other, their community and themselves.  The Financial Times said of FIVE SEASONS (1987), &quot;the novel succeeds in charting the ways in which grief and passions cannot be cheated.&quot;  The Village Voice wrote &quot;Yehoshua's stories find their way right into the unconscious. . . Nobel prizes have been given for less.&quot;\n\nHis most celebrated novel, MR MANI (1989), is a multigenerational look at Jewish identity and Israel through five conversations that go backwards in time to cover over 200 years of Jewish life in Jerusalem and around the Mediterranean basin.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* FIVE SEASONS (Doubleday, 1989).
