In Seattle, we view them more like a rich, reckless uncleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not someone whose debts we'd pay or help to build a new home. Remember how the Mariners narrowly lost a public vote to build Safeco Field before the legislature bailed them out, and how Qwest Field was fundedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on the backs of touristsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by a scant 51.1 to 49.9 percent margin in Paul Allen's special election.\n\nThat's the context for the documentary Sonicsgate, directed by Seattle filmmaker and fan Jason Reid. (He has also created short videos for SW's Web site.) By the time, four years ago, that Howard Schultz's Sonics ownership group came to feed at the taxpayer trough for yet another makeover of KeyArena, voters were in revolt. Initiative 91, which effectively prohibited city subsidization of sports arenas, passed overwhelmingly in 2006. In what can only be described as a poor-sport temper tantrum with dire consequences, Schultz and his partners then sold the team to an Oklahoma City ownership group at a time when anyone who knew anything about pro basketball knew Oklahoma City was angling for its own team. The leader of that group, Clayton Bennett, declined to consent to an interview for Sonicsgate, as did the other three menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½NBA Commissioner David Stern, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, and SchultzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Reid portrays as archvillains in his film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d2684eee678241bb75ae3cbdb0689cd849f1a6","amp;dn":"Sonicsgate+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d2684eee678241bb75ae3cbdb0689cd849f1a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,210,104,78,238,103,130,65,187,117,174,60,189,176,104,156,216,73,241,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
