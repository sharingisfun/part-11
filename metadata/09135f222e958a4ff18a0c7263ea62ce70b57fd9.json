People who pay for websites sometimes say that the professionals they hire donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand business and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stick to deadlines. A project manager is right in the middle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a shrewd project manager can clear up misconceptions in both directions while inspiring everyone involved to work together creatively.\n\nVeteran project manager BreandÃƒÂ¡n Knowlton has been working on the web since its beginning, and has seen spectacular successes and disastrous failures along the way. In Managing Web Projects he provides advice, checklists and guidelines for each phase of your work on a typical web project, whether or not you have a formal background in project management. From initial inception through to final evaluation, this book is filled with practical ideas to help you make your next web project a positive experience for everyone.\n\nWho should read this book?\nThose who share responsibility for projects arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always called project managers. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a web professional, agency principal, or represent an organisation commissioning a website, this book will give you the detail you need to keep things on track in your area, anticipate risks and create smooth relationships among stakeholders.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09135f222e958a4ff18a0c7263ea62ce70b57fd9","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Guide+to+Managing+Web+Projects+Opsylum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09135f222e958a4ff18a0c7263ea62ce70b57fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,19,95,34,46,149,138,79,241,138,12,114,99,234,98,206,112,181,127,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
