This energy technology roadmap identifies the key tasks that must be undertaken in order to achieve a vision of over 2 000 GW of wind energy capacity by 2050. Governments, industry, research institutions and the wider energy sector will need to work together to achieve this goal.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDisclaimer\nForeword\nKey Roadmap Findings\nIntroduction\nRationale for wind energy\nThe purpose of the roadmap\nRoadmap content and structure\nWind Energy Today\nEconomics\nVision for Deployment and CO2 Abatement\nPotential for cost reductions\nGlobal investment to 2050\nWind Technology Development and Deployment: Actions and Milestones\nWind energy resource assessment\nImproved wind turbines\nSupply chains\nIncreased research and development\nDelivery and System Integration: Actions and Milestones\nTransmission deployment to connect wind resources\nReliable system operation with large shares of wind energy\nPolicy Frameworks: Actions and Milestones\nIncentivising investment\nPublic engagement and the environment\nPlanning and permitting\nInternational Collaboration: Actions and Milestones\nRoadmap Action Plan and Next Steps\nActions led by the wind industry\nActions led by governments\nActions led by power system actors\nNext steps\nAppendix: References","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096924871f145bef434bfeb8aa4577e5b1854f54","amp;dn":"Technology+Roadmap+-+Wind+Energy+%282010%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096924871f145bef434bfeb8aa4577e5b1854f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,105,36,135,31,20,91,239,67,75,254,184,170,69,119,229,177,133,79,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
