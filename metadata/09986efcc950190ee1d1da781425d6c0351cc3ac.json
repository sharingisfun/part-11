Nevertheless, in past years, pasta has also been included in the Dominican's food habits due to its low cost and versatility. When a meal is going to be prepared, the first step is taken well ahead, sometimes the day before, by selecting the meat which is rinsed in cold running water and sprinkled with juice of sour oranges. By doing this, the meat is cleaned and reading to be seasoned. In the Dominican Republic, food is always fresh, beautifully presented, and prepared with pride and taste. This book is an invitation to all the ones who enjoy eating and cooking and would like to share the Dominican culinary experience with us.\n\nPublisher: Pilon; 1st edition (1993)\nLanguage: English\nby Maria Ramirez de Carias (Author)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09986efcc950190ee1d1da781425d6c0351cc3ac","amp;dn":"Dominican+Cookbook+by+Maria+Ramirez+de+Carias+%28Author%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09986efcc950190ee1d1da781425d6c0351cc3ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,152,110,252,201,80,25,14,225,209,218,120,20,37,214,192,53,28,195,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
