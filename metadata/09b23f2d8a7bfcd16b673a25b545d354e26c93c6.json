The evening they played with Tony Allen was just amazing. This is Jazz with Afro-Caribbean flavours at its best. Although in the past they were not really able to capture their amazing live sound onto disc, on this album they have succeeded! A truly must have for everyone who likes this style of music! (and for pastafari in particular ofcourse :)\n\nQuote from jazzlinks.net\n&quot;New Cool Collective was born in 1994 when these eight cool musicians ignited the Amsterdam club scene and then set fire to the rest of the Dutch music scene, spreading the heat rapidly to international festivals. From the start they were hot and never cooled down, releasing albums, winning the Edison Jazz Award in 2000 (the Dutch Grammy) and touring extensively. Whether playing at the London Jazz CafÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, North Sea Jazz Festival, Edinburgh Fringe Festival, or at clubs in Istanbul, Budapest, Letland, Estland, Vienna, Uganda and Russia, the band's steaming mix of highly danceable soul and jazz spiced with Latin flavors has turned on clubbers and jazz buffs alike. After a couple of years, the New Cool Collective founded their Big Band extension. The band loved playing with the groovy 19-piece line up and once again the crowd went mad. So they initiated monthly New Cool events at an Amsterdam club, where the big band played with different guest musicians. At one of these events the Afro-drummer Tony Allen (formerly involved in Fela Kuti's Band, and co-creator of the style known as highlife) played with them. This party lasted for several nights and instigated the Afrobeat club tour of the New Cool Collective Big Band featuring Tony Allen and the kora-player Ali Boulo Santo.&quot;\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
