There is also an option to create a installer package so you can easily setup the app and configuration on other pc's easily.\n\nOS Migrations\n\nQuickly migrate your legacy applications to Windows 7 or Windows 8 by eliminating the need to recode, retest and recertify. Faster deployments with less testing mean your business applications will be in production sooner, minimizing downtime and reducing business risks.\nTo make things even easier, you can automatically convert silent-installed applications to ThinApp packages. And, if you've already packaged applications with ThinApp for use on XP or other versions of Windows, you can easily convert them to the ThinApp Windows format with ThinApp's Relink feature.\n- See more at: http://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp/features.html#sthash.y50ZgzVO.dpuf\n\nApplication Isolation\n\nPackage an entire 32-bit or 64-bit application and its settings into a single .MSI or .EXE executable that can be deployed to many Windows operating environments. These virtual applications are isolated from each other and execute independently without making changes to the underlying operating system, eliminating application-to-application conflict as well as application-to-OS conflicts.\nIsolated applications in ThinApp run in a virtual bubble in restricted user accounts without requiring any host modification. Because applications run independently of each other, you can deploy Office 97, 2003, 2007, Internet Explorer and .NET applications or custom applications on the same OS without conflict.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\tInstallation Information\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRun VMware-ThinApp-Enterprise-5.0.0-1391583.exe\n\nfollow Installer instructions\n\nuse one of these serials to activate:\nAU3JL-F4Z9K-HZXNX-ZWZNX-QC5WZ\nGU5Q0-2WGE7-2ZN3W-LGYQC-QAMYA\nAG3ZP-DAW0K-HZDMM-MZQ79-MAJ8E\n\nEnter Name to Display in Portable App Startup Screen\n\nFinish Installation and run\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHANKS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ba69bb67891a8c45a89ec1aa7d08d74a1ccd51","amp;dn":"VMware+ThinApp+Enterprise+v.5+%5Bdanhuk%5D+%5Bdanhuk2k13%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ba69bb67891a8c45a89ec1aa7d08d74a1ccd51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,186,105,187,103,137,26,140,69,168,158,193,170,125,8,215,74,28,205,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
