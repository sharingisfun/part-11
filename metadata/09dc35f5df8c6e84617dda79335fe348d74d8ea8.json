First, thanks to K-Slender for the original upload. Unfortunately I like to read on a Kindle which is not good with a double column book. So, I have done an OCR on it, formatted it to single column, and moved the paragraphs together. While I was at it I made another PDF with bookmarks, which is fully searchable. I know that an OCR can have many typoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, but I have spent some time on this and think that I have got them all, if you find any please let me know. I have not bothered with the index as the page numbers would not be correct.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09dc35f5df8c6e84617dda79335fe348d74d8ea8","amp;dn":"Stalingrad+1942-1943+-+Stephen+Walsh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09dc35f5df8c6e84617dda79335fe348d74d8ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,220,53,245,223,140,110,132,97,125,218,121,51,95,227,72,215,77,142,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
