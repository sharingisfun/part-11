The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen. Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child &quot;unwound,&quot; whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end. Connor is too difficult for his parents to control. Risa, a ward of the state is not enough to be kept alive. And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound. Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a314d800a37cd6f5900e97518c6c02a549a0945","amp;dn":"Unwind+-+Neal+Shusterman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a314d800a37cd6f5900e97518c6c02a549a0945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,49,77,128,10,55,205,111,89,0,233,117,24,198,192,42,84,154,9,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
