Stavely was later replaced by Alan Wills and although bass players came and went, Joseph Fearon played on both of the studio albums, recorded by a reincarnated Mark II version of the band.\n\nEnjoying a degree of success and/or cult status in the USA, Germany, UK, Japan, and especially the Philippines, The Wild Swans also spawned two interesting splinter projects; Care and The Lotus Eaters. As the parent outfit, The Wild Swans remained the cornerstone and historically, will probably be remembered as the most revered and influential of the three projects.\n\nMembers: Paul Simpson (guitar, vocals), Jeremy Kelly (guitar), Gerard Quinn (keyboards, 1980-86), Rolo McGinty (bass, 1981-82), Joe Fearon (bass, 1985-90) \n\n01 Bringing Home the Ashes\n02 Young Manhood\n03 Bible Dreams\n04 Whirlpool Heart\n05 Northern England\n06 Mythical Beast\n07 Melting Blue Delicious\n08 Chocolate Bubblegum\n09 I'm a Lighthouse\n10 The Worst Year of my Life\n11 Butterfly Girl\n12 Space Flower\n13 Magic Hotel\n14 Bitterness\n15 Now and Forever\n16 Immaculate\n17 Archangels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a82664e6789eea935e01da745e200cec4d3dda2","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Swans+-+The+Platinum+Collection+%5BSophistipop%2FNew+Romant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a82664e6789eea935e01da745e200cec4d3dda2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,130,102,78,103,137,238,169,53,224,29,167,69,226,0,206,196,211,221,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
