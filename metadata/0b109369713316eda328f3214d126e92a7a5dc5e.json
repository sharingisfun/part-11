I&amp;#039;m not sure he knows it, but he is. In a new series, Comedy Lab kicked off with Karl Pilkington: Satisfied Fool (Channel 4, Monday, 11.05pm). Of course, Pilkington is best known for his world conquering podcasts with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, which sees Pilkington generally being called a fool. This show set out to discover just how intelligent... or dim... he really is. More importantly, Pilkington&amp;#039;s quest is to find out whether more knowledge would make him happier.\n\nPilkington left school with only one GCSE and a deadpan voice. The exam he passed was an E in history. That doesn&amp;#039;t sound out of the ordinary, but when you look at the fact that Pilkington thought he had two GCSEs (one in English and one in Art), it turns out that he doesn&amp;#039;t even recall taking the exam that he passed. Herein lies the brilliance of Karl Pilkington. He then went on to talk to some very clever people indeed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b109369713316eda328f3214d126e92a7a5dc5e","amp;dn":"Comedy+Lab+-+Karl+Pilkington%3A+Satisfied+Fool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b109369713316eda328f3214d126e92a7a5dc5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,16,147,105,113,51,22,237,163,40,243,33,77,18,110,146,167,165,220,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
