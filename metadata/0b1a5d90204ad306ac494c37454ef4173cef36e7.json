Though you wouldn't know it based on my torrent history, I'm actually a HUGE Batman fanatic. Also, naturally I have a soft spot for the Joker. This short-lived series looks at the clown prince of crime in his mid-70's heyday, right around &quot;The Joker's Five Way Revenge&quot; when he was just turning into a more lethal, credible and chaotic threat while retaining his humorous charm - and not yet approaching the near-complete darkness and sadism that would follow in the decades to come. Written by classic Batman scribe Denny O-Neil with great artwork from the likes of Dick Giordiano and others, this is definitely worth checking out if you love the Joker. And really, who doesn't? Thanks to Flattermann for the nice new scans, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1a5d90204ad306ac494c37454ef4173cef36e7","amp;dn":"The+Joker+01-09+%281975-1976%2C+C2C%2C+Flattermann%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1a5d90204ad306ac494c37454ef4173cef36e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,26,93,144,32,74,211,6,172,73,76,55,69,78,244,23,60,239,54,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
