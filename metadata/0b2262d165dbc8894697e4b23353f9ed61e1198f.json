Nello Balocchi (Neri MarcorÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©), 35, is a shy and clumsy man devoted to the academic world. His lack of interest in women has become an increasing source of anxiety to his womanizing father (Giancarlo Giannini), a tailor for the Pope. He sends Nello to teach in a high school in Bologna with the hopes that he will find a wife. After a series of mishaps, he finds himself at a dance in a home for blind women, where he meets Angela, a beautiful society girl who went blind in an accident. She turns his life upside down and teaches him that there is a lot more to love than meets the eye.[/QUOTE]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic1.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic2.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic3.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic4.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic5.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/ic6.png[/IMG]\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,115,566,080                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:47:15                \nFrame Count:....................................154272             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................304                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.316                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1185                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.231&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n---my rip-----\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
