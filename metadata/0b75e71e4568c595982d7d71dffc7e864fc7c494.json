Much of his time was spent as an organist and composer of sacred works, though he is known to have written several secular collections (such as madrigals) that have not survived. His style was modern, affected by both the Gabrielis, Frescobaldi, and Merulo. It's believed he kept up correspondence and an exchange of manuscripts with other musicians throughout Itally and abroad, which probably accounts for the sophisticated character of his secular music  heard here.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio of Corradini is enclosed.
