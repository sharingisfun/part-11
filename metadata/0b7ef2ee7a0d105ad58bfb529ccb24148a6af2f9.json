Within the game Fix-It Felix, Jr., the characters celebrate its titular hero but shun the villain, Wreck-It Ralph. At a support group for video game villains, Ralph reveals his desire to stop being a bad guy. Returning to his own game, Ralph finds the other characters celebrating their game's 30th anniversary without inviting him. Felix reluctantly invites Ralph to join them, but the others refuse to accept him, saying he would have to win a medal like Felix.\n\nWhile visiting Tapper's, Ralph meets a soldier from the first-person shooter Hero's Duty, who tells him the game's winner receives a medal. Ralph enters the game and encounters Sergeant Calhoun, its no-nonsense leader. Between game sessions, Ralph climbs the game's central beacon and collects the medal, accidentally hatching a Cy-Bug, one of the game's enemies. The Cy-Bug clings to Ralph as he stumbles into an escape pod that launches him out of the game. Meanwhile, with Ralph missing, a girl reports to Litwak that Fix-It Felix, Jr. is malfunctioning. Since broken games are unplugged, leaving their characters homeless, Felix sets off to find Ralph.\n\nRalph crash-lands in Sugar Rush, a kart-racing game. As he searches for his medal, he meets Vanellope von Schweetz, a glitchy character who makes off with the medal, planning to use it to buy entry into an after-hours race. King Candy and the other racers refuse to let Vanellope participate, claiming that she is not really part of the game. Ralph helps Vanellope build a kart, then teaches her how to drive in Diet Cola Mountain, an unfinished game level where Vanellope lives.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7ef2ee7a0d105ad58bfb529ccb24148a6af2f9","amp;dn":"Wreck-It+Ralph.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7ef2ee7a0d105ad58bfb529ccb24148a6af2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,126,242,238,122,13,16,90,213,139,251,82,156,203,36,20,138,106,242,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
