This collection of 25 knitted projects is the first to focus exclusively on beautifying the neck and shoulders. There are romantic capelets that float and flutter about, bold collars, and high-drama cowls that frame the face when worn slipped over the head or that drape elegantly when pushed down. With these projects-done up in a variety of yarns with simple stitches and techniques such as cabling-knitters of all skill levels will soon see how so little fabric can convey so much.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd39ee4b2e981e7d72ad01d6489dc1995c2f189","amp;dn":"Knit+%26amp%3B+Wrap%3A+25+Capelets%2C+Cowls+and+Collars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd39ee4b2e981e7d72ad01d6489dc1995c2f189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,211,158,228,178,233,129,231,215,42,208,29,100,137,220,25,149,194,241,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
