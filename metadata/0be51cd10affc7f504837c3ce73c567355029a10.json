Known as the Maritime Unit, it comprised AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first swimmer-commandos, an elite breed of warrior-spies who were decades ahead of their time when they created the tactics, technology, and philosophy that inspire todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Navy SEALs.\n\nThe pioneering men of the Maritime Unit conducted some of the most daring operations behind enemy lines and even survived one of the Third ReichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous concentration camps. But after the war, their astonishing record of activity and achievement was classified, lost, and largely forgotten...until now. In First SEALs, Patrick K. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donnell unearths their incredible historyÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the greatest untold stories of World War II","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be51cd10affc7f504837c3ce73c567355029a10","amp;dn":"First+SEALs-+Patrick+K+O%27Donnell+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be51cd10affc7f504837c3ce73c567355029a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,229,28,209,10,255,199,245,4,131,124,60,231,60,86,115,85,2,154,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
