On Friday the 13th of October, 1972, just such a story began when a charter plane carrying 45 rugby team members crashed in the remote Andes Mountains. For 72 days, the world thought they were dead. But what 16 survivors endured was far worse than death, driven to what would become headline-making acts of cannibalism in their struggle for life.\n\nI'M ALIVE! recounts one of the most historic human survival stories of all time as it has never been told before -- through the first person, on-camera account of one of the survivors, Nando Parrado.\n\nNando's simple, yet powerful and evocative storytelling will allow viewers to experience the nearly two and half months of heroism and tragedy through the eyes and memories of the man who lived it. His experience will also become a window for viewers into the history of other stories of extreme survival. Viewers will be further immersed into Nando's story through new, high-resolution imagery of photos shot by the survivors throughout their ordeal, and rarely seen footage of the crash site, as well as blended CGI/live action recreations of the crash itself, and the amazing struggle for survival that followed. \n\nFile Size ------- 699mb\nLength ---------- 1:27:54\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso Supported by \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bebb99edefec36072f62af8f0a697319e8d6ec7","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+I+Am+Alive+-+Surviving+The+Andes+Plane+Crash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bebb99edefec36072f62af8f0a697319e8d6ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,235,185,158,222,254,195,96,114,246,42,248,240,166,151,49,158,141,110,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
