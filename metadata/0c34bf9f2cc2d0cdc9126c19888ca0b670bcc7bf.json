It stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, and features appearances by Rodney Dangerfield, Robert Downey, Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Tommy Lee Jones. It is based on a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by Stone with writer Dave Veloz and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Notorious for its violent content, the film was named the 8th most controversial movie of all time by Entertainment Weekly. [2]\n\nThe film was promoted with the tagline &quot;A bold new film that takes a look at a country seduced by fame, obsessed by crime and consumed by the media.&quot;, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 26, 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Born Killers Soundtrack 1994\n\n\n\nNatural Born Killers is the soundtrack to the film Natural Born Killers, produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Reznor reportedly produced the soundtrack using a portable Pro Tools in his hotel room while on tour.[1][2] On his approach to compiling the soundtrack, Reznor told MTV:\n\nI suggested to Oliver [Stone] to try to turn the soundtrack into a collage-of-sound, kind of the way the movie used music: make edits, add dialog, and make it something interesting, rather than a bunch of previously released music.[3]\n\nSome songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack, such as &quot;Burn&quot; by Nine Inch Nails, and &quot;What Would You Do&quot; by Tha Dogg Pound.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tLeonard Cohen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot; (Edit)\n2.\tL7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Shitlist&quot;\n3.\tDan Zanes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Moon over Greene County&quot; (Edit)\n4.\tPatti Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Rock N Roll Nigger&quot; (Flood Remix)\n5.\tCowboy Junkies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; (Edit)\n6.\tBob Dylan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;You Belong to Me&quot;\n7.\tDuane Eddy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;The Trembler&quot; (Edit)\n8.\tNine Inch Nails ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Burn&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Route 666&quot; \nfeaturing Robert Downey Jr., and Brian Berdan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;BB Tone&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Totally Hot&quot; \ncontains an edit of Remmy Ongala And Orchestre Super Matimila ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Kipenda Roho&quot;\n11.\tPatsy Cline ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Back in Baby's Arms&quot;\n12.\tPeter Gabriel And Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Taboo&quot; (Edit)\n13.\t&quot;Sex Is Violent&quot; \ncontains excerpts of Jane's Addiction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Ted, Just Admit It...&quot; and Diamanda GalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;\n14.\tA.O.S.
