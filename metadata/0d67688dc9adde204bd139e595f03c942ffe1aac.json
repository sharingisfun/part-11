Haphazard assembly aside, much of it's great, including the huge hit &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot; and the controversial, string-laden acoustic ballad &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (a Top Ten item in America). \n\nRaiding the R&amp;B closet for the last time, they also offered a breathless run-through of Larry Williams' &quot;She Said Yeah,&quot; a sultry Chuck Berry cover (&quot;Talkin' About You&quot;), and exciting live versions of &quot;Route 66&quot; and Hank Snow's &quot;I'm Moving On.&quot;\n\nMore importantly, Jagger-Richards' songwriting partnership had now developed to the extent that several non-A-side tracks were reasonably strong in their own right, such as &quot;I'm Free&quot; and &quot;The Singer Not the Song.&quot; And the version of &quot;You Better Move On&quot; (which had been featured on a British EP at the beginning of 1964) was one of their best and most tender soul covers.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - She Said Yeah\n02 - Talkin' About You\n03 - You Better Move On\n04 - Look What You've Done\n05 - The Singer Not The Song\n06 - Route 66\n07 - Get Off Of My Cloud\n08 - I'm Free\n09 - As Tears Go By\n10 - Gotta Get Away\n11 - Blue Turns To Grey\n12 - I'm Moving On\n\n*2006 ABKCO Records / Universal Music Japan | UICY-93018\n      {Japan Mini LP Remastered 2006, UICY-93018}\n\n\n\n\nMore Rolling Stones Japan Mini LP DSD Remaster 2006:\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Out Of Our Heads.
