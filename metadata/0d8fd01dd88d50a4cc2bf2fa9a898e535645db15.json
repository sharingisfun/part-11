A Prequel of sorts to the currently publishing Trilogy. It gives you the first taste of the world Orson Scott Card envisioned for more then 3 decades.\n\nI'm posting this torrent that was only surviving on DHT seeds. I added some Public trackers to help breath life into this torrent as a story like this deserves to live. I hope you'll enjoy the Mither Mages as much as I do, and I encourage you to check out the new Trilogy starting with &quot;The Lost Gate&quot;(Book 1) and continuing in &quot;The Gate Thief&quot;(Book 2). Book 3 has not been given a release date yet(but I'm guessing early 2015).\n\nPlease support Orson Scott Card by Buying his Books and Short-Stories, when you're able, from book retailers. Amazon has decent prices.
