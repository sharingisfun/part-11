James&amp;#039; sympathetic pianisms best blend with the Sinocentric sonorities and syncopations on the hip-notic &quot;Gulangyu Island&quot; the Asian and French-inflected &quot;Melodia: A Quiet Place for Two&quot; and &quot;Angela with Purple Bamboo,&quot; a Silk Road update of James&amp;#039; beloved theme from the TV show Taxi. &quot;By combining the spirit of American jazz with the beauty of traditional Chinese instruments by absorbing and learning from this rich Eastern cultural heritage,&quot;&quot; James writes in the liner notes, &quot;I have sought to explore ways that we would communicate openly and freely; improvising and sharing our discoveries.&quot;\n\nPersonnel: \nBob James (piano)\nJack Lee (guitars)\nNathan East (bass)\nHarvey Mason\nLewis Pragasam (drums)\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Celebration  (4:13)\n2.Gulangyu Island (4:47)\t\n3.
