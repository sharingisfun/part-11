Vera Hillyard is a domineering and possessive woman who strives for obsessive control over a malicious older son, a youngest son who is--or isn't--illegitimate, and her younger sister, Eden, who secretly seeks to escape Vera's grasp and instead provokes a murder. This winner of the 1986 Edgar Award for best mystery novel belongs to the genre of old murders reconsidered and the question of who did what to whom and why is teasingly left unresolved.\nReview\nNo other living mystery writer complains more openly about the burden of fans expecting her to bring back series characters when she has other pursuits in mind. In A Dark-Adopted Eye . . . Rendell does what Conan Doyle never could: proves she has something far greater to offer. -- Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc20ce31394d8ec83975cdf0c012e5c45f8b139","amp;dn":"A_Dark_Adapted_Eye--OD48","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc20ce31394d8ec83975cdf0c012e5c45f8b139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,194,12,227,19,148,216,236,131,151,92,223,12,1,46,92,69,248,177,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
