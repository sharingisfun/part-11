Women's Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey was selected to coach against the winner of the Miesha Tate and Cat Zingano bout on the The Ultimate Fighter 17 finale in April 2013. Zingano won the fight, but a few weeks prior to filming was removed from the coaching position due to an injury and replaced by Tate.\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 720 x 480 (16:9 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e32b606a49ecc25a6d842e2fb85afcdc59c9cb5","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Fighter+18+-+Team+Rousey+vs+Team+Tate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e32b606a49ecc25a6d842e2fb85afcdc59c9cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,50,182,6,164,158,204,37,166,216,66,226,251,133,175,205,197,156,156,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
