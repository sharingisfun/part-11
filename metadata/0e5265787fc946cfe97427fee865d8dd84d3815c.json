The global child surrogacy industry is estimated to be worth two billion US dollars a year. Prospective parents are attracted to Mexico because it's cheaper - a successful surrogacy costs around US$45,000, less than half the price in the United States. And it's become a favoured destination for prospective parents around the world after controversies and clampdowns in India and Thailand. However, in Mexico they discover a disturbing situation, which can put surrogate mothers at risk - not least because implantations can be carried out before legally binding contracts are signed, placing the ownership of the baby in question.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/64/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7e/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Mexico-s-Baby-Business-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2592Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~122Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 23 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 456 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5265787fc946cfe97427fee865d8dd84d3815c","amp;dn":"Ch4+Unreported+World+2015+Mexicos+Baby+Business+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5265787fc946cfe97427fee865d8dd84d3815c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,82,101,120,127,201,70,207,233,116,39,254,232,101,216,221,132,211,129,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
