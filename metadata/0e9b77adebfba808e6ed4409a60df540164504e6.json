If you're the kind of person who likes to settle down with one of those gigantic, multi-generational novels, then this movie was made for you. Mao Da-bing (Xia Yu) is a water delivery guy in modern day Beijing , and he scrapes his microscopic salary together so he can escape into the movies as often as possible. One day in an alley he bumps into a young woman who picks up a brick and slams him over the head with it. At the hospital no one can get her to talk, and Mao is seething with righteous indignation over this random, ridiculous and extremely painful incident. So he's surprised to find himself doing her a favor, but that's how he winds up in her apartment feeding her fish while she's getting locked up in the local loony bin.\n\nHe discovers that her apartment is a shrine to 1930's actress Zhou Xuan, and he discovers the brick-wielding young woman's diary. Which, of course, he immediately reads. At this point the movie flashes back to rural Ningxia province, during the Cultural Revolution, and it tells the story of the woman, her mother, and how the movies kept them alive during one of the bleakest eras in Chinese history. A complicated mystery (who is this woman? Why'd she hit him with a brick? What happened to her family?) this is also a CINEMA PARADISO for Chinese film, and it reminds us that no matter how bad things get or how hopeless they may seem, there's always the movies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424273/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424273/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by: Jiang Xiao\n\nCast: Yu Xia, Haibin Li, Yijing Zhang, Zhongyang Qi, Zhengjia Wang\n\nCountry.........China\nLanguage.......Mandarin\nYear...........2004\nGenre..........Drama\nRuntime........1hr35min\nResolution.....592x320\nVideo..........896Kbps XviD\nAudio..........128Kbps MP3\nFrame rate.....25Fps\nSubtitles......English/Spanish .srt and Chinese .sub/idx\n\nJiang Xiao - Meng ying tong nian [Electric shadows] (2004)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e9b77adebfba808e6ed4409a60df540164504e6","amp;dn":"Jiang+Xiao+-+Meng+ying+tong+nian+%5BElectric+shadows%5D+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e9b77adebfba808e6ed4409a60df540164504e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,155,119,173,235,251,168,8,230,237,68,9,166,13,245,64,22,69,4,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
