Oh no. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already here, living in the head of the guy who just crossed the street in front of you, or maybe even closer than that. We saw these possibilities get played out in the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bloodsporting-anarchist-yuppie shocker of a first novel, Fight Club. Now, in Survivor, his second and newest, the concern is more for the origin of the malaise. Starting at chapter 47 and screaming toward ground zero, Palahniuk hurls the reader back to the beginning in a breathless search for where it all went wrong. This time out, the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s protagonist is self-made, self-ruined mogul-messiah Tender Branson, the sole passenger of a jet moments away from slamming first into the Australian outback and then into oblivion. All that will be left, Branson assures us with a tone bordering on relief, is his life story, from its Amish-on-acid cult beginnings to its televangelist-huckster end. All of this courtesy of the planeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flight recorder.\n\nSpeaking of little black boxes, Skinnerians would have a field day with the presenting behavior of the folks who make up PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world. They pretend theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re suicide hotline operators for fun. They eat lobster before itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ done. They dance in morgues. The Cleavers they are not. Scary as they might be, these characters are ultimately more scared of themselves than you are, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what makes them so fascinating. In the wee hours and on lonely highways, they exist in a perpetual twilight, caught between the horror of the present and the dread of the unknown. With only two novels under his belt, Chuck Palahniuk is well on his way to becoming an expert at shining a light on these shadowy creatures. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bob Michaels ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nThe rise and fall of a media-made messiah is the subject of PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impressive second novel (after the well-received Fight Club), a wryly mannered commentary on the excesses of pop culture that tracks the 15 minutes of fame of the lone living member of a suicide cult. Tender Branson, aged 33, has commandeered a Boeing 747, emptied of passengers, in order to tell his story to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblack boxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while flying randomly until the plane runs out of gas and crashes. Branson relates in his long flashback the vicissitudes of his life: a member of the repressive Creedish Death Cult, supposedly founded by a splinter group of Millerites in 1860, he is hired out as a domestic servant who must dedicate his earnings to the cult. Despite his humble beginnings, Branson finds himself on the edge of fame and fortune when the cult members begin their suicide binge, and he keeps himself on the media radar by using the psychic dreams of his potential romantic interest, Fertility Hollis, in which the girl accurately predicts a series of strange disasters. After a brief period at the top of the freak-show heap, Branson succumbs to the excesses of his trade when his agent mysteriously dies at the Super Bowl as Branson predicts the outcome of the game at half-time, simultaneously triggering a riot and turning him into a murder suspect. BransonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spookily matter of fact account of his bizarre experiences does not excite tension until the narrative is well under way, but the novel picks up momentum during the homestretch when Branson goes on the lam with Fertility and his murderous brother Adam, and the story steamrolls toward its nightmarish climax. PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DeLilloesque cultural witticisms and his satirical take on the culture of instant celebrity invest the narrative with a dark humor that does not quite overcome its lack of a coherent plot. Agent, Edward Hibbert. (Feb.) FYI: Fight Club is being filmed by David Fincher.\nCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.
