Lyrically, the group displays the same warmth and compassion so evident in their choice of a name (taken, by the way, from a Japanese comic book character); songs tackle sex (&quot;Trouser Minnow&quot;), ethnicity (&quot;Hated Chinee&quot;), and classic rock (&quot;Radar Love Lizard&quot;); there's even a Sonic Youth 'homage' called &quot;Kim Gordon's Panties.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0edd2ade18343e1494d16b0b4d29dc0b30906672","amp;dn":"Rapeman+-+Two+Nuns+and+a+Pack+Mule+%281988%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0edd2ade18343e1494d16b0b4d29dc0b30906672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,221,42,222,24,52,62,20,148,209,107,11,77,41,220,11,48,144,102,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
