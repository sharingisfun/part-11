It has all streets and trails marked.\n\nTo provide one single map all of Norway has been projected into the\ncoordinate system for UTM Zone 32, although some parts should be in\nother zones. This may cause some slight distortion in the easternmost\nparts of the map.\n\nIf you are planning a hike in the mountains, remember that although\nmountains and lakes often stay at the same place huts and trail markers \ncan be moved or removed - always bring a recent map!\n\nThe map is in the JPEG/JGW format and should work with most map software.\nIf it doesn't work with yours there are free tools to convert to lots of\nother formats.\n\nPlease help seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f184b74a87a4e2adbd45887cff4c89953116bec","amp;dn":"Norgekart+N50+-+Topographical+map+of+Norway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f184b74a87a4e2adbd45887cff4c89953116bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,24,75,116,168,122,78,42,219,212,88,135,207,244,200,153,83,17,107,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
