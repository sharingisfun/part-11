With Arms Wide Open (Radio Version) \nCreed's second album continues in the vein of MY OWN PRISON, combining heavy guitar rock with lyrics that aspire to something beyond standard rock &amp; roll hedonism. There's plenty of head-banging riffs for lead singer Scott Stapp's Vedder-esque ... Full Descriptionwail to ride over (although the band is surprising nimble considering how heavy it plays) and this time out there's also some softer stuff --&quot;Say I,&quot; &quot;Wrong Way&quot;--with more than a hint of Led Zeppelin in its Middle-Eastern experimental mode. Even more surprising, there's actually a ballad here--&quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;--with a wistfully beautiful melody. \n\n&quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song and was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f44520bfb65a3ca7356d17035d55a00ccae8b44","amp;dn":"Creed+-+Human+Clay+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f44520bfb65a3ca7356d17035d55a00ccae8b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,68,82,11,251,101,163,202,115,86,209,112,53,213,90,0,204,174,139,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
