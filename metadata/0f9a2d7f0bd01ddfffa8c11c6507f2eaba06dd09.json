Based on past experience and this first wave of thusly-tagged rips, anything below 400 dpi (2,560 pixels wide, at standard aspect ratio) is to be considered &quot;ordinary&quot; and anything above 450 dpi (~3k pixels wide at standard AR) &quot;ultra&quot;.\n\nTo illustrate what the releases are actually like, I'm replacing the usual cover image by an interior sample here - a scaled-down page on the left, and a full-size detail from the centre of that page on the right, with the green frame pointing out the corresponding portions.\n\nEnjoy! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9a2d7f0bd01ddfffa8c11c6507f2eaba06dd09","amp;dn":"%5BuHD%5D+Spawn+249+%28Image%29+%28December+2014%29+%28Digital%29+%28Empire%29+%28Nem%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9a2d7f0bd01ddfffa8c11c6507f2eaba06dd09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,154,45,127,11,208,29,223,255,168,193,28,101,7,242,234,186,6,221,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
