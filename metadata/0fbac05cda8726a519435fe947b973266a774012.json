The three-part series explores Burma's forests. The filmmakers are Gordon Buchanan, Ross Piper and Justine Evans. The scientists for the series are Chris Wemmer, Darrin Lunde, Khyne U Mar, Kristofer Helgen and Nicole Edmison\n\n\nWild Burma: Nature's Lost Kingdom - Episode 1\n\nFor the first time in over 50 years, a team of wildlife filmmakers from the BBC's Natural History Unit and scientists from the world renowned Smithsonian Institution has been granted access to venture deep into Burma's impenetrable jungles. Their mission is to discover whether these forests are home to iconic animals, rapidly disappearing from the rest of the world - this expedition has come not a moment too soon.\n\nOn the first leg of their journey, wildlife filmmakers Gordon Buchanan and Justine Evans set out to discover whether the mountains of western Burma are home to a population of Asian elephants that could prove critical to the survival of the species. Finding elephants in a dense bamboo forest is a challenge. Notoriously grumpy, Asian elephants are likely to charge if caught unaware. It is a race against time as the world eyes up Burma's natural riches - what the team finds could change the future of Burma's wilds forever.\n\nWild Burma: Nature's Lost Kingdom - Episode 2\n\nOn the second leg of their journey, wildlife filmmakers Gordon Buchanan and Justine Evans, along with a team of scientists, head deep into the mountains of western Burma. This is where they hope to find the shy sun bear and two of the world's rarest and most beautiful cats: the Asian golden cat and the clouded leopard.\n\nMeanwhile, zoologist Ross Piper and the science team are on a mission to create a wildlife survey to present to the government of Burma to persuade them that these forests are so unique they must be protected. High on the forest ridges, Gordon finds evidence to suggest that Burma's wildlife might be in danger. Undercover filming in a border town known as the 'Las Vegas of the jungle' leads to a shocking discovery.\n\nWild Burma: Nature's Lost Kingdom - Episode 3\n\nFor the last leg of their journey, the team search for the most iconic animal of them all, the tiger. To find it, they must split up. Wildlife camerawoman Justine Evans and the science team head to the tangled jungles of northern Burma, one of the largest swathes of unbroken forest in Southeast Asia. Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan heads to the only other place in Burma where tigers may still exist, the far south. The forests of Karen State were once home to a thriving population of tigers, but this region has been isolated by war for over 60 years and little is known about the fate of the animals.\n\nThe team must overcome intense physical hardship and tough field conditions to find the evidence they need to help preserve this unique and largely untouched wilderness. What they discover could change the future of Burma's forests forever.\n\ncast\n\nNarrated by:...Paterson Joseph\nPresented by:...Gordon Buchanan/Ross Piper/Justine Evans\nProducer(s):...Tim Martin/Susanna Handslip\nProduction:...BBC Natural History Unit\n\n\n\nVideo:-\n\nFormat :mkv/AVC\nWriting Library :x264 /&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0941606e6149453d2739&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nDuration : 52mn 3s  /52mn 21s /53mn 13s  \nBitrate : 3 700 Kbps/ 3 750 Kbps/ 3 800 Kbps\nResolution=Width/Height :1 920 x 1 080  pixels\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio:-\n\nFormat :AC-3  \nBitrate : 640 Kbps\nChannels :2 Channels\nChannel Positions : Front: L R  \nSample Rate : 48KHz\nLanguage : English\n\nRelease info:-\n\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG\nTitle/Year : &quot;Wild Burma: Nature's Lost Kingdom&quot;/ 2013\nFile Size : 1.61 GiB /1.64 GiB  /1.68 GiB\nGenre :  Documentary\nSource : Blu-ray 1080p AVC DD2.0 - HDCLUB [Thanks]\nChapters : Yes\nSample : Yes\nSubtitles(VobSub): Dutch.\nIMDB :   www.imdb.com/title/tt3560618/\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/2yvSPqH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/2yvSPqH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Rp8UAtx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Rp8UAtx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/B2GWEJB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/B2GWEJB&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nGreetz To: SaM |oziman|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|3Li|Extratorrent|.\n\n\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fbac05cda8726a519435fe947b973266a774012","amp;dn":"Wild.Burma.Natures.Lost.Kingdom.2013.1080p.Blu-Ray.x264-tomcat12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fbac05cda8726a519435fe947b973266a774012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,186,192,92,218,135,38,165,25,67,95,233,71,185,115,38,106,119,64,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
