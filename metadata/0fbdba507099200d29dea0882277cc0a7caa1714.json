Here, I\\'ve done my best to outline the basic concepts and, again, I\\'ve done that without all of the mainstream Chaos babble. I haven\\'t read all of the PDFs (only skimmed) but i have listened to the audios. I can attest that they are, in fact, awesome.\n\nEverything has an element, a tool, a belief that is useful. It\\'s like cooking. Sure you can use some one else\\'s recipe or one style but, it\\'s not until you make something your own that you create greatness. Brothers and Sisters, never be afraid to explore outside of the Occult to grow in the Occult and Magick.\n\nHonestly I\\'m not satisfied with this. I\\'ll make a version 2 sometime in the future. Or if you want to, let me know of a good article or book, etc, and we\\'ll collaborate.\n\nCONTENTS:\n-Audio\n\nLimitless\nBegin With End In Mind\nParadigm Shifting\nThe Flow\n\nKC01 - 01 - Introduction\nKC01 - 02 - Ken Willber- Kosmic Storyteller\nKC01 - 03 - Integral map-making\nKC01 - 04 - I, We, and It - the Good, the True, and the Beautiful\nKC01 - 05 - The Four Quadrants\nKC01 - 06 - The Lines of Development\nKC01 - 07 - The special importance of cognitive development\n\n-PDFs\nAn-Introduction-to-Chaos-Magick\nConsequentialising-Practical-Reason\nCycles-of-Chaos-Deconstructing-Initiation\nDeconstructing-the-Mind\nFlowers-of-Kairos\nmagick_is_dangerous\nMoral-Nihilism\nNo-Belief\nParadigms\nParadigms Lost - Paradigms Regained\nParadigms-and-Principles\nParadigm-Shift\nStephen-Mace-Seizing-Power\nThe-illusion\nThe-Paradigm-of-Debt\nUtilitarianism\nTorrent downloaded from\n\n-Html/webpage docs\nDoze Green on Chaos Magick\nmagic-101-for-marxists\nmagick_man_by_rak_razam\nWhy Chaos Magicians Are Such Assholes\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSEED SEED SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fbdba507099200d29dea0882277cc0a7caa1714","amp;dn":"Making+Chaotes+-+The+Psychology+Behind+Chaos+Magick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fbdba507099200d29dea0882277cc0a7caa1714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,189,186,80,112,153,32,13,41,222,160,136,34,119,204,10,124,170,23,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
