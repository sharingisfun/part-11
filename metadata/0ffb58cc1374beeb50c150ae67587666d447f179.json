He lives in San Francisco, California. Many of his pieces, self-described as &quot;rural folk piano&quot;, evoke the essence of a season and reflect natural landscapes. He also is known for his tribute album of Vince Guaraldi's compositions for the Peanuts animations.\nWinston dresses unassumingly for his shows, playing in stocking feet, stating that it quiets his &quot;hard beat pounding&quot; left foot. For years, the balding, bearded Winston would walk out on stage in a flannel shirt and jeans, and the audience would think he was a technician, coming to tune the 9-foot Steinways that are his piano of choice.\n\nHere are his complete recordings from '72 to '96. Every album has a jewel case and its own artwork, and a separate folder in the torrent. They are put together in a gift box. There is another booklet in this giftbox and I also scaned the front of the gift box, so If one decide, can make also the box for this seven gems.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
