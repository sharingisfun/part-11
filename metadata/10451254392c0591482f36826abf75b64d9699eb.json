Corporal Blutch is a reluctant soldier, highly critical of authority, whose only wish is to get out of the army and return to civilian life, often threatening to desert and coming up with ways to avoid going into yet another senseless battle. Blutch does have a heroic side and will not hesitate to fight against the Confederate troops even to the risk of his own life. Sergeant Cornelius Chesterfield is by contrast a devoted and obedient career soldier, always determined that he and Blutch should be in the thick of the action. He is proud of his scars and dreams of military glory. Though strong and brave to the point of recklessness, he is clumsy and narrow-minded, unable to clearly perceive the madness of the war around him. Though their relationship is often antagonistic, they are comrades for life and have saved each other's lives many times in spite of repeated threats made by both of doing the other in.\n\nYou might think it seems familiar, that might be because you played the computer game based on it, North vs South, which was out on the C64, amiga and PC, and remade a few years ago :)\n\nThe series is child friendly, so can safely give it to your kids :)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/7906/thebluecoats1robertsonv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/7906/thebluecoats1robertsonv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img442/7906/thebluecoats1robertsonv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img442/7906/thebluecoats1robertsonv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img341/8097/thebluecoats2thenavyblu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img341/8097/thebluecoats2thenavyblu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img831/8097/thebluecoats2thenavyblu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img831/8097/thebluecoats2thenavyblu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img819/9694/thebluecoats3theskyride.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img819/9694/thebluecoats3theskyride.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/9694/thebluecoats3theskyride.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/9694/thebluecoats3theskyride.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/1531/thebluecoats04thegreenh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/1531/thebluecoats04thegreenh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img208/1531/thebluecoats04thegreenh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img208/1531/thebluecoats04thegreenh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img26/8397/thebluecoats05rumberley.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img26/8397/thebluecoats05rumberley.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img84/8397/thebluecoats05rumberley.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img84/8397/thebluecoats05rumberley.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10451254392c0591482f36826abf75b64d9699eb","amp;dn":"The+Bluecoats+1-5+%28data9724-DCP+and+The+Man-Arr-Tee-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10451254392c0591482f36826abf75b64d9699eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,69,18,84,57,44,5,145,72,47,54,130,106,191,117,182,77,150,153,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
