The music of Charles Mingus goes beyond simple categorization. Schooled in classical music, with his early professional exposure in the Los Angeles swing scene, Mingus moved through numerous styles, working with the major innovaters, such as Bud Powell, Charles Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, &amp; Eric Dolphy. A volatile personality, his gentle and extreme sides are both in view. My favorite scenes are of Mingus' responses to stupid questions. By the end of this film, even those people who do not appreciate jazz will agree to Charles Mingus' place as one of the finest composers &amp; musicians in American history.
