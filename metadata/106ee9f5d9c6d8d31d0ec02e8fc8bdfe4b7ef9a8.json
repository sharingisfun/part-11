I enjoyed them tremendously. I found them hidden at the back of the bookshelf, dusted them off, and relived the memories of eight years ago. Today I shall share them with everyone.\n\nNote: These are VERY old CDs. They are unlikely to work even in Windows XP due to sound card issues. The best way is to install and use them in Windows 98/2000 computers or virtual machines. Free virtualisation software include Microsoft Virtual PC or Virtualbox.\n\nThese CDs are a valuable resource for children aged 7-16, they will enjoy them a lot and learn a lot from it. There are 4 CDs in this package:\n\n1.
