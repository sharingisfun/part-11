Norman Granz, head of Verve and Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s producer, gives a flowery introduction that Fitzgerald goes on to justify. The opening &quot;St Louis Blues,&quot; with an extended, intricate scat solo, is simply transcendent, and the ballads, like a slinky version of Duke Ellington&amp;#039;s &quot;Just Squeeze Me (But Please Don&amp;#039;t Tease Me),&quot; are stunning. The hour-long program also features a small-combo set with the always-amazing Oscar Peterson Quartet and a salute to Louis Armstrong, with whom Fitzgerald had recently recorded three albums. The entire performance is simply remarkable, and a must for Fitzgerald fans.\n\nPersonnel: \nElla Fitzgerald (vocals)\nLou Levy (piano)\nMax Bennett (bass)\nGus Johnson (drums)\nOscar Peterson (piano)\nHerb Ellis (guitar)\nRay Brown (bass)\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Introduction  [in Italian]\n2.St. Louis Blues\n3.These Foolish Things (Remind Me Of You)\n4.Just Squeeze Me\n5.Angel Eyes\n6.That Old Black Magic\n7.Just One Of Those Things\n8.I Loves You Porgy\n9.It&amp;#039;s All Right With Me\n10.I Can&amp;#039;t Give You Anything But Love\n11.Introduction  [in Italian]\n12.When You&amp;#039;re Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You)\n13.Foggy Day, A\n14.Midnight Sun\n15.Lady Is A Tramp, The\n16.Sophisticated Lady\n17.Caravan\n18.Stompin&amp;#039; At The Savoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1071b555fe045b64b60bf6c1f58edd3c149b98aa","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+-+Ella+in+Rome%3A+The+Birthday+Concert+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1071b555fe045b64b60bf6c1f58edd3c149b98aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,113,181,85,254,4,91,100,182,11,246,193,245,142,221,60,20,155,152,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
