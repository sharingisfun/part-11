For instance, liquid is used as a way of transporting what you get out of the mine, which might be better than shoveling it into freight cars and carrying it out by train.\n\nSlurry systems are fundamental to dredging, many mineral processes, bridge and tunnel construction, and to the manufacturer of synthetic petroleum products from oil sands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10786927b012f3189cf1cc0da8b7732d15c44cf2","amp;dn":"Slurry+Systems+Handbook+-+Baha+Abulnaga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10786927b012f3189cf1cc0da8b7732d15c44cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,120,105,39,176,18,243,24,156,241,204,13,168,183,115,45,21,196,76,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
