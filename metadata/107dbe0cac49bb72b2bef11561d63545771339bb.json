Vol 2\nLabel: bootleg recording \nTracks:9+12 \nTotal Time: 57:10 + 72:33 \nRelease Date: 1997 \nBitrate: mp3 320 kbps \n\n&quot;Great bootleg live set from 1997 with excellent audio quality to boot as it was recorded directly from console to DAT capturing all the nuances and ambiance of a live performance, featuring the great vocalist Queen Bey from Kansas City in a loving tribute to another great, late blues queen, Dinah Washington. The supporting band is led by the great Arthur Blythe on alto sax and piano player Mike Hennessey from the UK who spices things up with a touch of British wit every time he makes an announcement through the microphone. The repertoire is full of timeless standards expertly delivered. Great stuff indeed, enjoy. &quot;\n\nQueen Bey &amp; Arthur Blythe - Live!
