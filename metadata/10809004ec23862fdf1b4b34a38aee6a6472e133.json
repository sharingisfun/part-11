It sounds and looks fantastic! \nIncludes &quot;Money&quot; - is a bonus!\n\nFor the DVD I recommend ImgBurn. Why? Because only ImgBurn uses the most flexible \nalgorithm for determining the transition point on the DVD-9. Among the programs that \nspecialize in recording, ImgBurn - actually the only one able to create a conformal \nDVD-Video in all cases where it is physically possible (and honestly refuse to write \nthe disc, if it is not possible). Another plus - the program is absolutely free to get better at the official site, it has rusifikotor.And so, using ImgBurn to create an ISO file (Create image from files / folders), the program prompts you to select a cell for the transition between layers, select the cell 12, then write the DVD (Burn image to disk). 4x write speed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10809004ec23862fdf1b4b34a38aee6a6472e133","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Delicate+Sound+of+Thunder+%2F+DVD+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10809004ec23862fdf1b4b34a38aee6a6472e133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,128,144,4,236,35,134,47,223,27,75,52,163,138,238,106,100,114,225,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
