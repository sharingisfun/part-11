To stop Lucifer from erasing the past, they must find the place where the angels fell to earth.\n\nDark forces are after them, and Daniel doesn't know if he can do this: live only to lose Luce again and again. Yet together they face an epic battle that will end with lifeless bodies ... and angel dust. Great sacrifices are made. Hearts are destroyed.\n\nAnd suddenly Luce knows what must happen, for she was meant to be with someone other than Daniel. The curse they've borne has always and only been about her - and the love she cast aside. The choice she makes now is the only one that truly matters. In the fight for Luce, who will win?\n\nThe astonishing conclusion to the Fallen series. Heaven can't wait any longer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10b6efbd269208b85c8d744a792c2c7a160fdd13","amp;dn":"Lauren+Kate+-+Rapture+-+Fallen+Book+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10b6efbd269208b85c8d744a792c2c7a160fdd13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,182,239,189,38,146,8,184,92,141,116,74,121,44,44,122,22,15,221,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
