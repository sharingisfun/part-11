It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly ShÃ…ï¿½nen Jump magazine since July 19, 1997, with the chapters collected into seventy-eight tankÃ…ï¿½bon volumes to date. One Piece follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man whose body gains the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his diverse crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the ocean in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as &quot;One Piece&quot; in order to become the next Pirate King.\n\nThe manga has been adapted into an original video animation (OVA) produced by Production I.G in 1998, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999 and has aired 700 episodes to date.\n\nThe series begins with the execution of Gol D. Roger, a man known as the King of the Pirates (Ã¦ÂµÂ·Ã¨Â³Å Ã§Å½â€¹ KaizokuÃ…ï¿½). Just before his death, Roger announces that his treasure, the One Piece (Ã£ï¿½Â²Ã£ï¿½Â¨Ã£ï¿½Â¤Ã£ï¿½ÂªÃ£ï¿½Å½Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã§Â§ËœÃ¥Â®ï¿½ (Ã£Æ’Â¯Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’â€Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ¹) Wan PÃ„Â«su), will be available to anyone who finds it, beginning the Great Pirate Era (Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂ·Ã¨Â³Å Ã¦â„¢â€šÃ¤Â»Â£ Daikaizokujidai). As a result, countless pirates set out to the Grand Line to look for the treasure.\n\n[PLOT - SPOILER ALERT]\n\nTwenty-two years have passed since Roger's execution, and Monkey D. Luffy, a young man inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate &quot;Red Haired&quot; Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue sea to find the One Piece and proclaim himself as the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates (Ã©ÂºÂ¦Ã£â€šï¿½Ã£â€šâ€°Ã¦ÂµÂ·Ã¨Â³Å Ã¥â€ºÂ£Ã§Â¯â€¡ Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan?), Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a liar; and Sanji, a womanizing chef; in their journey, they acquire a ship named the Going Merry and engage in confrontations with pirates including Buggy the Clown, Captain Kuro and Don Krieg. Later, Luffy encounters Arlong, a fishman and member of the former Sun Pirates who thinks that fishmen are superior to humans. After Luffy defeats Arlong, Nami officially joins Luffy's crew and the Navy places a bounty on Luffy's head. Luffy, then meets Captain Smoker, a Navy captain who can turn into smoke. He briefly captures Luffy, but Luffy is saved by his father, Monkey D. Dragon. After making their way through the Grand Line, the group meets Nefeltari Vivi, a princess who wants to help save her country, the Alabasta Kingdom, from the crime syndicate Baroque Works. They later befriend the doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer Tony Tony Chopper while in Drum Island.\n\nThe Straw Hat Pirates arrive in Alabasta, leading to battles with Baroque Works and their leader, Sir Crocodile. Luffy finally defeats Crocodile and liberates Alabasta. Soon after, Nico Robin, an archaeologist formerly employed by Baroque Works, joins Luffy's crew. They soon encounter Blackbeard, the alias of Marshall D. Teech, who also aspires to become the King of the Pirates. After traveling to the floating island of Skypiea, the crew gets involved in a war between the Skypieans and the Shandorians, leading to a confrontation against the island's ruler, Eneru, who has the power of lightning. Luffy defeats Eneru to save Skypiea and end the war. The crew soon meets the navy admiral Aokiji, who reveals that Robin was involved in searching for Poneglyphs, which are stones with markings left by an ancient civilization to reveal the missing 100 years of history that the World Government had erased. The group goes to Water 7, where they battle the cyborg shipwright Franky and are informed that the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, leading to Usopp's temporary departure from the Straw Hat Pirates. However, Cipher Pol No. 9, the World Government's intelligence agency, captures Robin and Franky for information regarding the Poneglyphs and the ancient weapons that may come from them. Franky liberates himself from the government after burning his blueprints for one of the weapons and teams up with the Straw Hat Pirates to declare war on the government, resulting in battles between CP9 and its members. The final long battle with CP9 ends when the crew saves Robin. To replace the sunken Going Merry, Franky constructs a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, for the Straw Hats and officially joins the crew. Soon after, the crew helps a musician skeleton named Brook, who was revived after eating a Devil Fruit, find his shadow aboard the gigantic pirate ship Thriller Bark, which has been stolen by Gecko Moriah. After defeating Moriah, Brook joins Luffy's crew.\n\nAfter arriving at Saboady Archipelago, the crew prepares to sail to the New World, the second half of Grand Line. While there, they befriend Silvers Rayleigh, the vice captain of Roger's pirate crew who they ask to coat their ship so they can travel underwater. The crew eventually gets separated during a battle with Bartholomew Kuma, a huge cyborg under the control of the Navy, at the Sabaody Archipelago; Luffy is transported to the all-female island Amazon Lily.\n\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\n\nVideo &amp; Source: Webrip/BD/HDTV\nAudio Source: Webrip/BD/HDTV/DVD\n\nFile Container: MKV\nVideo Format: h.264/Mpeg4 AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\n\nAudio Type: 2 Channel Stereo\nTrack 1: Japanese\nTrack 2: English\nAudio Format: AAC for All English &amp; Most Japanese tracks / AC3 for the rest\n\nSubtitle Language: English\nSubtitle Format: Mixture of SSA/SRT\n\n[SCREENSHOTS]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/izfbbuy4x/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/izfbbuy4x/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jarwdc1jn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jarwdc1jn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nmgi2c8gj/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nmgi2c8gj/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ivqqet02f/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ivqqet02f/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jnkobt82p/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jnkobt82p/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10cd2958252220119e90ce4ae96cf5e5abbc9a59","amp;dn":"One+Piece+001-409+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10cd2958252220119e90ce4ae96cf5e5abbc9a59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,205,41,88,37,34,32,17,158,144,206,74,233,108,245,229,171,188,154,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
