Developers can modify the core code and add features and functionality by installing extensions from the Magento Connect marketplace.\n\nBusinesses using Community Edition to run their stores will want to have access to their own Magento experts, since Magento does not provide technical support for this software. Answers to many technical questions are available on our user forum.\n\nSmall businesses that prefer to have access to technical support and a more comprehensive feature set should consider Magento Go, our &quot;commerce in the cloud&quot; solution. Mid-large size businesses that need support, additional features and our best performance should consider Magento Enterprise Edition.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.magentocommerce.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.magentocommerce.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f5cd88d68b6a9a99b0048e1f14c0cda7f10ca6","amp;dn":"Magento+ZendServer+with+MySQL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f5cd88d68b6a9a99b0048e1f14c0cda7f10ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,245,205,136,214,139,106,154,153,176,4,142,31,20,192,205,167,241,12,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
