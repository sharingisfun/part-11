Lord Bless All\n\nTrembling Bells meets Bonnie 'Prince' Billy on what is, for our money, one of the finest releases either act has put their name to. The 'Bells trade in their ghostly, none-more-British folk style for something more American in flavour, summoning all those amazing, lavishly orchestrated country-soul albums cut in LA and Nashville in the 1970s - think Micky Newbury, Jimmy Webb, David Wiffen, et al - but with such gusto, and attention to detail, that it never feels like mere pastiche. Lavinia Blackwall's vocals, ordinarily so ominous and eldritch, sound alternately romantic and ribald here, revelling in the interplay with Will Oldham' oak-smoked croon; Oldham too is clearly having a ball playing the role of suitor and rogue in Alex Neilson's terrifically wrought songs, particularly on 'I Can Tell You're Leaving'. Blackwall's Scotch heritage bubbles to the fore on the heart-stopping acapella 'My Husband's Got No Courage In Him', and towards the end there's some outright rock 'n roll action: 'Riding' recalls No Other-era Gene Clark and trippy closer 'Lord Bless All' posits a parallel universe where Dark Side Of The Moon was cut by The Byrds rather than Pink Floyd.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1129a941589c545b37943cec4fb2e2abe16a7b3a","amp;dn":"Trembling+Bells+%26amp%3B+Bonny+%27Prince%27+Billy...The+Marble+Downs%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1129a941589c545b37943cec4fb2e2abe16a7b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,41,169,65,88,156,84,91,55,148,60,236,79,178,226,171,225,106,123,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
