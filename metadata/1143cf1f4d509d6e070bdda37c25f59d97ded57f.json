With his customized, flamethrower-equipped motorcycle, and temporary super-strength courtesy of the experimental drug Q-47, the Los Angeles, California-based Hell-Rider battled the Claw, a masked, heroin-smuggling, secret society leader in issue #1, and a bestial rampager called the Ripper in issue #2. The stories featured scantily clad rock starlets, nightclub waitresses, and groovy, pot-smoking ' 70s chicks all quickly losing what little clothing they wore.\nThe series was created by Gary Friedrich, who would go on to co-create the better-known, Marvel Comics supernatural motorcyclist Ghost Rider, and illustrated by the veteran team of penciler Ross Andru and inker Mike Esposito","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1143cf1f4d509d6e070bdda37c25f59d97ded57f","amp;dn":"Hell-Rider+%23+1-2+%28Skywald%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1143cf1f4d509d6e070bdda37c25f59d97ded57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,67,207,31,77,80,157,110,7,11,221,163,124,37,245,157,151,222,213,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
