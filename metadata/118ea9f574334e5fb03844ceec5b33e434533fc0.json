As the story unfolds, two step-siblings hold together amidst schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, family breakdown, animal telepathy, misguided love, and the tiniest hope that everything will someday make sense.\n\nThanks goes to wsz for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
