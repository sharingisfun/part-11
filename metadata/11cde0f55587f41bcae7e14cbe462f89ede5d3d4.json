Surer, maybe, since C&amp;J have made far more recordings than C&amp;W.\nCelia Cruz is the nearest thing to an icon in contemporary salsa, and since she reaches at least two generations, you can bet on this reaching at least the Top Three, if not the zenith. (AMG)\n\n\n\nThis album, The Winners, originally released in 1987 on Vaya Records, was the last of three collaborations between the late, great sonera, Celia Cruz and world renown trombonist, producer and singer, Willie Colon.\nCelia's readily apparent improvisational vocal prowess leaves no doubt as to why she was the most sought after female sonera of the era. Por algo le decian &quot;La Reina&quot;! Willie does not play any musical instruments, but his phenomenal skills as a producer and innovator are tantamount. As evidence of the high esteem and affection that Willie held for the trombone, he recruited not one, not two, not three, but FIVE excellent trombonists for this album: Steve Turre, Barry Rogers, Angel Vazquez, Leopoldo Pineda and Lewis Kahn.\nAlso, in addition to producing the album, Willie sings the chorus lines along with some of the most mellifluous voces of the era: Milton Cardona, Tito Allen, Domingo Quinones and Adalberto Santiago. With a cast of seasoned musicians, this album had all the important elements in place for a blockbuster recording.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/157/frontrv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/157/frontrv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Un Bembe Pa' Yemaya\n02 - Son Matamoros\n03 - Vendedores\n04 - El Paraiso\n05 - Dice Anton\n06 - Yo Si Soy Veneno\n07 - Se Tambalea\n08 - Ache Para Todos\n\n\n\nOriginally Released by Vaya Records, Inc.
