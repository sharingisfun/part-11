Packed with features across all classical music genres, its globally acclaimed writers inform and entertain you with independent and intelligent editorial and more than 150 reviews in every issue. Gramophone's reputation is founded on its acclaimed critical analyses of the latest CD releases, in-depth features and interviews with classical stars, and its comprehensive coverage of recorded and live music.\n\nIN THE MAY ISSUE: This year marks the 300th anniversary of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's birth and to celebrate Richard Wigmore has written an in-depth study of the man and his highly original music; Jeremy Nicholas speaks to leading organists Cameron Carpenter and Thomas Trotter about how they are revolutionising the organ recital to appeal to new audiences; Caroline Gill meets violinist Renaud CapuÃƒÂ§on and discovers a man who, no matter what life throws at him, won't be distracted from his art; the Musical Director of the Dunedin Consort, John Butt, discusses a new edition of Mozart's final work, the Requiem; Tully Potter evaluates the legacy of recordings of the Smetana Quartet; Marc Rochester explores the music of Scottish composer James MacMillan, whose music is proof that accessibility needn't involve artistic compromise; Edward Breen chooses 10 recordings of music that demonstrate the oriental influences in Early music; and Andrew Achenbach seeks out the most rewarding recording of Vaughan Williams's ferocious Fourth Symphony.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
