Guiding the reader from the campaignÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins to its aftermath, and covering the commanders and forces of King Richard III and Henry Tudor, this is a complete treatment of one of the most important events in English history. Shakespeare was to immortalize the battle and RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death in Richard III, and the life and reign of the last Plantagenet have sparked centuries of debate. Christopher Gravett cuts through myth and propaganda as he clearly details the course of this pivotal campaign","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12f2acf8796b605b73418c9b663d849a0a9e9c56","amp;dn":"Bosworth+1485%3A+Last+Charge+of+the+Plantagenets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12f2acf8796b605b73418c9b663d849a0a9e9c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,242,172,248,121,107,96,91,115,65,140,155,102,61,132,154,10,158,156,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
