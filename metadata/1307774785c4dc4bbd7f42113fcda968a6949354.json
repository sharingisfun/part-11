It can also teach adults a thing or two!\r\nEach answer is short and to the point--less than one page in length. The reader can learn about such things as the origins of the metric system, the origins of April Fool's Day, the invention of elevators and typewriters, the presidential faces on Mount Rushmore, and much more. One chapter even addresses questions about love and romance.\r\nMost of the content is science-related, making it especially useful for science teachers. The chapter on the human body discusses things such as cancer. Other chapters address questions about various living things, such as rattlesnakes and jellyfish. Still others correct misconceptions about such things as poisonous mushrooms, color-blindness in animals, hyenas, and the construction of igloos.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nChapter I The World We Live In 12\r\nChapter II Animal Ufe 158\r\nChapter III Our Body and What Happens To It 240\r\nChapter IV How Things Began 302\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/rp4sb41hx/Still_More_Tell_Me_Why_Answers_to_Hundreds_of.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1307774785c4dc4bbd7f42113fcda968a6949354","amp;dn":"Still+More+Tell+Me+Why+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1307774785c4dc4bbd7f42113fcda968a6949354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,7,119,71,133,196,220,75,189,127,66,17,63,205,169,104,166,148,147,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
