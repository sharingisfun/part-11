Quincy Griffin ; director of photography, Robert Shepard ; editors, Veronica Silver, Rhonda Collins ; co-producer, Mridu Chandra ; \n\n  A documentary examining the life of Bayard Rustin who, although one of the first &quot;freedom riders,&quot; an adviser to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and A. Philip Randolph, and an organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, was forced to play a background role in landmark civil rights events because he was homosexual.\n\n\nMy notes:\n\n   A look behind the scenes at the Civil Rights movement through the story of Bayard Rustin: a formidable organizer who went unrecognized as the architect of the first planned mass civil rights march on Washington in 1958.\n\n   I was not aware of Bayard Rustin over the 50 years of the civil rights movement.  I heard the name given the relevance it deserves only last week and following that, as a result of seeing this film.  That is sometimes how things work out.\n\n  Watch for the short scene from the film &quot;Boycott&quot;.  It is likely the best role that Jeffrey Wright has ever done. &quot;Boycott is worth seeking out here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255851/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255851/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  If there is interest, I will torrent it myself.\n\nNotes written July 13, 2012\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130dea31dd8f08c3e1e8fab47ae1786b4c7cfb1e","amp;dn":"Brtother+Outsider+%282002%29+documentary+on+civil+rights+leader+Baya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130dea31dd8f08c3e1e8fab47ae1786b4c7cfb1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,13,234,49,221,143,8,195,225,232,250,180,122,225,120,107,76,124,251,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
