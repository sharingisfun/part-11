Meeting gorgeous, smart, uber-snarky Casper Kennedy was the highlight of SlaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last trip home to New York. The soldier in him carefully plans his conquest. Unfortunately, CasperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wearing some seriously strong armor and SlaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm offensives bounce right off. CasperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refusal to fall for him is puzzling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention incredibly annoying. When Slater gets leave again after grueling back-to-back tours in Afghanistan, all he wants is another shot at wooing Casper. He jumps right into the battle for the other manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart, but Casper does not intend to entertain the troops. A heartbreaking revelation changes the rules of romantic warfare, and Slater suddenly realizes he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just want Casper. He wants to capture his heart, too.\n\nCasper Kennedy is fighting a losing battle. A certain outrageously demonstrative Army Ranger has been a thorn in his side since his last trip home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the main character in his steamiest dreams. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back. He launches an all-out sensual assault and no matter how hard Casper pushes Slater away, the man somehow manages to inch closer. So close, in fact, that CasperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s once-impenetrable defenses are in danger of collapsing. Should he throw up the white flag and take a chance at love? Or start firing back and keep his heart protected? When the handsome Ranger shows his true colors, Casper just might have to surrender the fight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134dc91b08ce95da2908275308e645ef02d77afd","amp;dn":"A+Fighting+Man+%28Sandrine+Gasq-Dion%29+EPUB+MOBI+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134dc91b08ce95da2908275308e645ef02d77afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,77,201,27,8,206,149,218,41,8,39,83,8,230,69,239,2,215,122,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
