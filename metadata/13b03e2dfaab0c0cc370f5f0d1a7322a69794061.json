Elizabeth is about to be crowned queen of England and wants her personal musician Kate Haywood to prepare music for the festivities. New to London, Kate must learn the ways of city lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and once again school herself as a sleuth.\n\nLife at the center of the new royal court is abuzz with ambition and gossipÃ¢â‚¬â€very different from the quiet countryside, where Kate served Elizabeth during her exile. Making her way among the courtiers who vie for the new queenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favor, Kate befriends Lady Mary Everley. Mary is very close to Elizabeth. With their red hair and pale skin, they even resemble each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€which makes MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder all the more chilling.\n\nThe celebrations go on despite the pall cast over them. But when another redhead is murdered, Kate uncovers a deadly web of motives lurking just beneath the polite court banter, and follows the trail of a killer whose grievance can only be answered with royal blood.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nPraise for the series: \n\n&quot;Meticulously researched and expertly told...Amanda CarmackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent for creating a richly drawn setting, populating it with fully realized characters, and giving them a tight and engaging narrative is unparalleled.
