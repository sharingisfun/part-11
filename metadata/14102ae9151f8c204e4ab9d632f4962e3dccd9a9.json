ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not necessarily a goal youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trying to attain, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just an overall vibe of what can be good.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nBoth LevyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach and filmmaking skills made him the perfect choice for director of the Shambhala Music Festival documentary. Levy has made close to ten short films for CBC, has made numerous scratch videos and is the director of the New Forms Film Festival in Vancouver.\n\nThe documentary captures the spirit of the first ten years of Shambhala, the people, the music, the mountains, the river that runs through the site and the feeling of gathering for four days with 10,000 other people.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe have the ability to express ourselves with festivals like Shambhala or Burning Man and the ability to have autonomy and freedom around those things,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Levy said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think the one thing I get out of Shambhala more than anything is just how lucky and fortunate each and every one of us are to have places like that to congregate and communicate.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLevy and his crew of ten spent nearly two years going through 300 tapes of footage.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe shot for seven years at Shambhala as well as received footage from people who had been there for the years before that,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Levy said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo really, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s footage in the film from almost every year of the festival as well as archival footage.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLevy employed a non-linear narrative, which, to a certain degree, mirrors being at the festival itself.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe narrative of the film follows different characters through a year in the life of Shambhala from the perspective of DJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, people in charge, first aid attendants and others,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Levy said. At the same time itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the story of how the festival was born and created, the history of it and the story of the stages. By using a narrative that wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t linear, we were able to create what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d consider a more objective narrative.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNumerous DJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s make an appearance in the documentary, including Adam Freeland, Z-Trip, Fort Knox Five and FreQNasty. The film also gives a beautiful overview of the festival site and includes humourous footage of random partygoers.\n\nFor Levy, working together with others and a sense of community were key in making the documentary.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe thing about a film like Shambhala is youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re really integrating within a festival. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re becoming more comfortable over the year with people who would become characters, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re building trust and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got the family [site owners Rick and Sue Bundschuh] and all the different people working on the festival. There was an interesting fluidity in working with all of these different people.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nOver the last 10 years the Shambhala Music Festival has enjoyed a global reputation as one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preeminent music and art festivals. The festival prides itself on inclusiveness, community and good vibes.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was a vision that came from many, many years of work and development,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Levy said of the documentary. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt really was a community project.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14102ae9151f8c204e4ab9d632f4962e3dccd9a9","amp;dn":"Shambhala+2007+DVDRip+%28Released+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14102ae9151f8c204e4ab9d632f4962e3dccd9a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,16,42,233,21,31,140,32,78,74,185,214,50,244,150,46,61,204,217,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
