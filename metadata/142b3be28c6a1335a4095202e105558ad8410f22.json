In this series, Julia chooses her favourite, most accessible family treks in search of the perfect walk with a view which anyone can do in a lovely morning or afternoon ramble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  The High Cup Walk, Cumbria \r\nHidden beneath the hulking great Pennines, Julia sets off from the ancient village of Dufton in search of one of Britain's best kept secrets - the Grand Canyon of the North, a magnificent hanging glaciated valley, that's been 500 million years in the making. A true highlight of the Pennine Way, it was described by walking legend, Alfred Wainwright, as a 'natural wonder' and 'unforgettable sight'. Along her route, Julia meets a family of Olympic rake makers, learns about the notorious Helm wind - the only British wind deemed worthy of a name - and meets Mike Hartley, the current record holder of the Pennine Way, who ran the whopping 268 miles in under three days! It's then on to High Cup Nick, at the top the impressive glaciated valley, with mesmerizing views over High Cup Gill. With over 16 million people visiting the nearby Lake District each year, and just 6000 getting up to High Cup - the Grand Canyon of the North is a very well-kept secret.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/16/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Best-Walks-with-a-View-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3134 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 500 MB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142b3be28c6a1335a4095202e105558ad8410f22","amp;dn":"Best+Walks+With+A+View+With+Julia+Bradbury+Series+1+4of8+Cumbria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142b3be28c6a1335a4095202e105558ad8410f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,43,59,226,140,106,19,53,164,9,82,2,225,5,85,138,216,65,15,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
