These include the wounds through the wrists, the feet, the crown of thorns, the scourging of the back and finally the spear through the side.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1473cef46954f9723e111e1f07147e95b82f8704","amp;dn":"Stigmata+1999+DvDrip+minstrel.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1473cef46954f9723e111e1f07147e95b82f8704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,115,206,244,105,84,249,114,62,17,30,31,7,20,126,149,184,47,135,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
