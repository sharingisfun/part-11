Drawing in on the millions of letters written home by American doughboys, nurses, drivers, and clerks; reveals what it was like to fight in the &quot;Great War&quot;. The real story of World War I wasn't told in official reports.

SAVE OUR HISTORY: DEAR HOME: LETTERS FROM WWI tells the story of war through the eyes of the American men and women soldiers who lived through it.
