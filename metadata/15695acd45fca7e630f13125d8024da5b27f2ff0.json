While members have come and gone in the time leading up to Candy Coated Fury, the band's seventh studio album (and first new material in five years), the band still feels like the old familiar Reel Big Fish most ska fans will remember from the mid-'90s. Not a lot has changed musically, and the album feels like it could've easily been the follow-up to Why Do They Rock So Hard?, but with ska being more of a traditionalist's art form, Reel Big Fish make the familiarity work for them. PThough folks who are unfamiliar with the band would probably do better to start with classic albums like Turn the Radio Off and Why Do They Rock So Hard?, longtime fans and lapsed ska fanatics will immediately feel transported back to the glory days of the third wave revival, making Candy Coated Fury a welcome reminder that Reel Big Fish are alive, kicking, and still not afraid to take a shot at love gone sour with a smile and a few monstrous riffs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15695acd45fca7e630f13125d8024da5b27f2ff0","amp;dn":"+Reel+Big+Fish+-+Candy+Coated+Fury+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15695acd45fca7e630f13125d8024da5b27f2ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,105,90,205,69,252,167,230,48,241,49,37,216,2,77,165,178,127,47,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
