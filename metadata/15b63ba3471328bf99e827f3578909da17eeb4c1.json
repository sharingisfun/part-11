On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½En hand i himlenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which translates to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½A Hand in HeavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), the Stockholm-based electronic artist, whose debut is slated for February on Hybris, harnesses soft vocals and dreamy synths (think A Flock of SeagullsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½WishingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to a particularly dramatic electric drum and a pulsing bassline (think New OrderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s... any song). The son of a preacher, Johansson spent three years recording songs in a bunker to get the right sound. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½En hand i himlenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is nothing youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d call new, but damned if he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make it all sound freshly autumnal, another ideal song for another overcast day.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b63ba3471328bf99e827f3578909da17eeb4c1","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Johansson+-+En+hand+i+himlen+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b63ba3471328bf99e827f3578909da17eeb4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,182,59,163,71,19,40,191,153,232,39,243,87,137,9,218,23,238,180,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
