The group's roots dated to the summer of 1966, when drummer Steve Upton formed a band called Empty Vessels with bassist/vocalist Martin Turner and guitarist Glen Turner. Empty Vessels soon changed their name to Tanglewood and moved to London; during a gig at the Country Club in Hampstead, they were seen by would-be rock manager Miles Copeland, who was impressed with the jazz and progressive rock influences within the band and offered to be their manager.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Blind Eye\n02.Queen Of Torture\n03.Jail Bait\n04.Throw Down The Sword\n05.Warrior\n06.No Easy Road\n07.Moonshine\n08.Mother Of Pearl\n09.You See Red\n10.Living Proof\n11.Bad Weather Blues\n12.Open Road\n13.Underground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160d1f4897c70c4f2b10904760515a26a390d6d5","amp;dn":"Wishbone+Ash+-+The+Collection+%282003%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160d1f4897c70c4f2b10904760515a26a390d6d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,13,31,72,151,199,12,79,43,16,144,71,96,81,90,38,163,144,214,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
