An abridged 2003 version read by Hugh Laurie (known from the TV series Black Adder and Jeeves and Wooster).\n2. An unabridged 2005 version read by Martin Jarvis.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginally published in 1889, this novel is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\n\nThe book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers the jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\n\nThe trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This was just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.\n\nThe novel was an overwhelming success and stands today as one of the great classics of early English comedy literature.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecommended to anyone who likes classic low key &quot;tea and crumpets&quot; style English humor.\n\nBy the way, the text of this novel is available in several formats and include the original illustrations (choose HTML if you just want to view it on screen):\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease seed after downloading!\n\nHappy listening!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16709b985b85fc576682ea1b6e14348e565a30c5","amp;dn":"THREE+MEN+IN+A+BOAT+-+by+Jerome+K+Jerome+%28classic+English+humor%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16709b985b85fc576682ea1b6e14348e565a30c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,112,155,152,91,133,252,87,102,130,234,27,110,20,52,142,86,90,48,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
