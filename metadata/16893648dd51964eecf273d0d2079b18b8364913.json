And yet many couples find themselves too time-starved and intimacy-shy to enjoy it to the full. Loving Sex helps couples to overcome these barriers with advice from a renowned sexual health counselor.Loving Sex offers a friendly, frank exploration of what sex means as part of a loving relationship, and how you and your partner can experience it to its full potential. Free from unrealistic media representations of perfect bodies and porn-star practices, Loving Sex shows you the positions that work, helps resolve common problems without blame or embarrassment, and explains just how important sex can be to long-term loving happiness.Each of the 11 chapters explores a different aspect of sexuality, from the anatomy and physicality of arousal and orgasm, to the psychology of lust, love, and partnership. Candid explanations of sexual practices and positions are supported by photography and illustrations, allowing couples to relish foreplay, explore new positions and techniques, and experiment with exotic practices, from dressing up to Tantra. The final chapters offer tips on safer sex, and explore the ways in which an enduring sexual relationship can be the foundation for a lifetime of loving intimacy.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nDr Laura Berman is the founder and director of the Berman Center in Chicago, which specialises in sexual health.
