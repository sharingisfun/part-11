In addition to his recorded legacy as an avatar of American roots music, his original material was covered by artists from the worlds of rock, blues, and country, from Bob Seger and Bonnie Tyler to Lou Ann Barton and the Bellamy Brothers. And Miller himself scored a surprise U.K. Top Ten smash in 1978 with &quot;Darlin',&quot; giving his likable, soulful style the popular airing many fans felt it deserved all along. \n\nFrankie Miller was born November 2, 1949, in Glasgow, Scotland; he began singing with local bands beginning in 1967, in a style influenced by American soul singers like Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and Otis Redding. After a few years, he moved to the more fertile music scene in London, where he soon met ex-Procol Harum guitarist Robin Trower in the summer of 1971. Impressed with Miller's talents as a raw soul belter in the vein of a Rod Stewart or Joe Cocker, Trower offered him a job as lead vocalist of his new band Jude. It wasn't to be Miller's big break, though; internal conflicts split the group apart by the following year, and Miller returned to the London pub rock circuit.\n\nDuring 1972, he made frequent appearances at the Tally Ho in Kentish Town, often sitting in with Brinsley Schwarz, and signed a solo record deal with Chrysalis. Using the Brinsleys as a backing band, Miller recorded his debut album, &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot;. That alone is reason enough to own this record. Add to that a nice batch of songs (mostly originals) and you have an enjoyable album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171a1f9e6d4d1f9aaf1408acff3fe7f418ce62bf","amp;dn":"Frankie+Miller+-+Once+In+A+Blue+Moon+%282013+Japan+Remaster%29+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171a1f9e6d4d1f9aaf1408acff3fe7f418ce62bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,26,31,158,109,77,31,154,175,20,8,172,255,63,231,244,24,206,98,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
