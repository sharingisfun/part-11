Find out how Jesus works through the &quot;twin sacraments&quot; of Reconciliation and the Eucharist to heal your deepest wounds. Ideal for a variety of parish ministries.\n\n---\n\nVinny Flynn is the founder of Mercysong Ministries and is best-known for his bestselling book and CD Seven Secrets of the Eucharist. He is also the man who sings the Divine Mercy Chaplet on EWTN. Along with his wife Donna, he has been serving the Church in active ministry for over thirty years through teaching, writing, retreats, speaking, counseling, and music. &quot;Healing and Holiness&quot; is the same ground-breaking talk Vinny Flynn has given at retreats all over North America.\n\nEveryone needs healing. Jesus calls you to seek holiness. Yet not many folks make the connection between these two foundational Christian necessities--that is, not until they hear this amazing talk by Vinny Flynn. No matter who you are, how old you are, and regardless of your particular circumstances in life (good or bad), we promise that &quot;Healing and Holiness&quot; will open you eyes, gladden your heart, and begin the divine process of healing that leads to realistic, authentic holiness.\n\nIf you've heard Vinny's inspiring &quot;Seven Secrets of the Eucharist,&quot; then you know he has the rare gift for translating difficult theology into layman's terms. This profound talk is the opposite of trendy--it's drawn from the timeless teachings of the saints, doctrines in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Gospels, and recent writings of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. &quot;Healing and Holiness&quot; has already helped transform the lives of countless people at retreats all across North America.
