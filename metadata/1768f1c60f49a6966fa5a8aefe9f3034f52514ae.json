The EP was, as a joke, named after the band Warrant, who had just released an album called Dog Eat Dog. The release of the Warrant EP made it possible for the band to tour the Eastcoast of the US and their first overseas tour, supporting the Bad Brains in the U.K. and 7 Seconds &amp; Big Drill Car in Europe. \nThings really started rolling with the release of the All Boro Kings album in 1994. After the release of this successful album, which eventually sold more than 500,000 copies, Dog Eat Dog went for a second European tour supporting Biohazard together with Downset. Besides the hit single No Fronts the album featured classic Dog Eat Dog songs, such as WhoÃƒÂ¢??s the King?, Pull My Finger and If These Are The Good Times. The album and hit single, produced by the late Jam Master Jay, resulted in Dog Eat Dog winning an MTV Europe video music award in 1995 for breakthrough artist, beating Alanis Morisette, Portishead and Weezer in the process. \n\n\n01.
