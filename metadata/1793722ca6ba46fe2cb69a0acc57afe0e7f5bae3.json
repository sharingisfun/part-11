Meanwhile, &quot;The Bitch Came Back&quot; gives a hilarious send-off to a bad ex with roaring guitars and flourishes of horns. &quot;Hurricane&quot; stirs up a storm of emotions over an orchestral hum of guitars and massive chorus. Then there's &quot;Head Above Water,&quot; which delivers an uplifting, contemplative message encased in mid-tempo rhythms. Theory of a Deadman are telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth, like it or not.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Lowlife                                              [03:26]\n02.Bitch came back                                      [03:39]\n03.Hurricane                                            [04:18]\n04.Out of my head                                       [03:58]\n05.Gentleman                                            [03:29]\n06.Love is hell                                         [03:31]\n07.The truth is ...
