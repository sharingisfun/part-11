The music is \r\nlistenable but not too much above that since it was taped rather \r\nfar away from the PA system.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nCD 1\r\n1. Rock And Roll  \r\n2. Celebration Day\r\n3.

The Ocean* \r\n\r\n*The cuts in The Ocean could not be fixed as the audience recording does \r\nnot include this song.\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe second show of the three night stand and the second to last of the 1973 tour, this is a very good, although somewhat loose show. Robert's voice alternates between being very strong and creaking a bit but it is surprisingly strong in Since I've Been Loving You and Stairway To Heaven. The band is playing very well, in a loose and exciting Dazed And Confused. Moby Dick is extremely long yet somewhat exciting and the last three numbers rock hard! But there's something really special with this gig - some serious excerpts are used on official movie and soundtrack; just listen to the middle section of No Quarter, Dazed And Confused and Bonham's drum solo ... fantastic!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17ae4021230a158c407ca5a98f2356a8278ca1a7","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.07.28+Madison+Square+Garden%2C+NY+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17ae4021230a158c407ca5a98f2356a8278ca1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,174,64,33,35,10,21,140,64,124,165,169,143,35,86,168,39,140,161,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
