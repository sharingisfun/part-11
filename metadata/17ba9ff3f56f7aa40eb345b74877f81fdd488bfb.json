The bold notion to team blues masters Muddy Waters and &quot;Little Walter&quot; Jacobs with rocking rhythm-and-blues king Bo Diddley works wonders throughout, achieving a creative chemistry and energy rarely seen in jam bands of this sort. The vocal and instrumental interplay on every track is intensely competitive in the tradition of jook house &quot;headcutting&quot; contests, with each performer spurring the next on to evermore impressive heights, while soaring through a repertoire of favorites like Muddy's &quot;Long Distance Call,&quot; Bo's &quot;I'm a Man&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love,&quot; Little Walter's &quot;Sad Hours,&quot; and Willie Dixon's &quot;You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover.&quot; With the powerhouse headliners backed by the likes of Otis Spann on piano and Buddy Guy on guitar, this period piece remains a fun and refreshing gem. --\n\nTracklist\n1.
