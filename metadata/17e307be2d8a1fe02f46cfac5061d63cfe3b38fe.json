Vladimir Putin, with very little governmental or administrative experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, and briefly, director of the secret policeÃ¢â‚¬â€nevertheless seemed the perfect choice: a Ã¢â‚¬Å“facelessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ creature whom Yeltsin and his cronies could mold in their own image. Russia and an infatuated West were determined to see in him the progressive leader of their dreamsÃ¢â‚¬â€even as Putin, with ruthless efficiency, dismantled the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s media, wrested control and wealth from the business class, and destroyed the fragile mechanisms of democracy. Within a few brief years, virtually every obstacle to his unbridled control was removed and every opposing voice silenced, with political rivals and critics driven into exile or to the grave.\n\nMasha Gessen has experienced and reported this history firsthand, and brings it up to its present moment of unrest and uncertainty. Her spellbinding account of PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise and reign will stand as a classic of narrative nonfiction.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nLibrary Journal\nGessen came to America as a teenager but has since returned to Russia, where she edits the magazine Snob; she's also written a handful of well-received books, mostly on Russian topics. All of which puts her in the perfect position to write rigorously about the rise to power of Vladimir Putin. Despite news reports, Putin doesn't have quite the notoriety he deserves in the West; Gessen should push him to the forefront.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e307be2d8a1fe02f46cfac5061d63cfe3b38fe","amp;dn":"Masha+Gessen+-+The+Man+Without+a+Face+-+The+Unlikely+Rise+of+Vla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e307be2d8a1fe02f46cfac5061d63cfe3b38fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,227,7,190,45,138,31,224,47,70,207,172,80,97,214,60,254,59,56,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
