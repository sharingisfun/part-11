Without an architecture that is appropriate for the problem being solved, the project will stumble along or, most likely, fail. Even with a superb architecture, if that architecture is not well understood or well communicatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in other words, well documentedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the project cannot be considered a complete success.\n\nAlthough architecture is now widely recognized as a critical element in software development, there has been little guidance independent of language or notation on how to capture it. Based on the authors\\' extensive experience, Documenting Software Architectures helps you decide what information to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in various notations, including UML), shows you how to express an architecture in a form that everyone can understand. If you go to the trouble of creating a strong architecture, you must also be prepared to describe it thoroughly and clearly, and to organize it so that others can quickly find the information they need.\n\nEssential topics for practitioners include:\n\n    * Seven rules for sound documentation\n    * The uses of software architecture documentation, including goals and strategies\n    * Architectural views and styles, with general introductions and specific examples\n    * Documenting software interfaces and software behavior\n    * Templates for capturing and organizing information to generate a coherent package\n\n\n# Hardcover: 592 pages\n# Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 2 edition (October 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321552687\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321552686","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:186ba72028de8fa19c21675852d961a5fb776db3","amp;dn":"Documenting+Software+Architectures%2C+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"186ba72028de8fa19c21675852d961a5fb776db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,107,167,32,40,222,143,161,156,33,103,88,82,217,97,165,251,119,109,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
