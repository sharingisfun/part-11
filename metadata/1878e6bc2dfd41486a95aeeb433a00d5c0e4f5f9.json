You can:\n- Sort books by title, author, series, date changed or read, with both ascending and descending sorts.\n- Group books by title, author, tags, series, publisher, and most calibre custom column types; including optional navigation by first letter.\n- View a &quot;book jacket&quot; showing all the details of a book, including calibre's custom columns.\n- Launch your book reader application to read a book (works with most reader applications).\n- Search for books using calibre-like search syntax.\n- Scan your library folders for books not in Calibre Companion's database and adding them. This process uses calibre to help get the highest quality metadata available.\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1878e6bc2dfd41486a95aeeb433a00d5c0e4f5f9","amp;dn":"Calibre+Companion+v2.1.1+Full+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1878e6bc2dfd41486a95aeeb433a00d5c0e4f5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,120,230,188,45,253,65,72,106,149,174,235,67,58,0,213,192,228,245,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
