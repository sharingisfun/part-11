The term is derived from the earlier use of &quot;jump-up&quot; to refer to tracks with often ambient intros which altered their style at the drop, often by breaking into amen breakbeats. This would make the crowd &quot;jump up&quot; and dance. Around 1994 it began to be more exclusively applied to records with hip hop samples and oscillating basslines, such as Suburban Bass artists Dream Team and DJ Hype, and by 1995 more specifically to the style associated with DJ Zinc and Ganja Records.\n\nIt is usually characterized by basslines that have a filter shaping LFO on them which gives the bass a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“wobbleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sound accompanied by uptempo drum loops.\n\nMost frequently in modern Jump-Up, an element of highly energetic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“stabsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are often heard. Jump-Up is closely related to the more popular 1996ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1997 era of jungle-drum and bass, known for its 'warmthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ through beat and melody syncopation and simpler heavy basslines (as opposed to the lighter, more distorted basslines of the precise-sounding techier styles of Neurofunk &amp; Techstep coming out around this time).\n\n\nThis series will continue every month , same goes for the dubstep torrents , if you have any dnb/jump-up tunes you want to share? send us a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7b2f1a09120a241c1e16161e101e3b13140f161a121755181416&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;,\n\nCheers!\n\nBit-Step","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:191935a21f96832399ebaf748997afb07c863188","amp;dn":"Heavy+Jump-Up+Torrents+2011+%28First+and+last+edition+of+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"191935a21f96832399ebaf748997afb07c863188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,25,53,162,31,150,131,35,153,235,175,116,137,151,175,176,124,134,49,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
