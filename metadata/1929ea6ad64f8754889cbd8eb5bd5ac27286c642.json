And there's help direct from outer space as Britain's first astronaut on the International Space Station, Tim Peake, dials in.\r\n\r\n3. The Next Frontier\r\nKevin explores the next frontier of human space travel. Live from the Station, Tim answers questions directly from the children in the lecture theatre audience. With Tim's help out in Earth's orbit, Kevin investigates how the next generation of astronauts will be propelled across the vast chasm of space to Mars and beyond. So, how will life be artificially sustained as we travel the millions of kilometres to the red planet and on into the cosmos? How will our food last for three years or more? And what is waiting what for us when we finally land? With earth-shattering experiments, top space scientists and our astronaut live from space, Dr Fong reveals how we'll survive that voyage to space's next frontier and beyond.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3211Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 1.38 GB (average)\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1929ea6ad64f8754889cbd8eb5bd5ac27286c642","amp;dn":"How.to.Survive.in.Space.3of3.The.Next.Frontier.720p.HDTV.x264-MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1929ea6ad64f8754889cbd8eb5bd5ac27286c642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,41,234,106,214,79,135,84,136,156,189,142,181,189,90,194,114,134,198,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
