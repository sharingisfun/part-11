But now, a dangerously obsessed individual has begun sending her trinkets and gifts suitable only for those in deepest mourningâ€”a black mirror, a funeral wreath, a ring set with black jet stone. Each is engraved with her initials.\r\n\r\nDesperate for help and fearing that the police will be of no assistance, Calista turns to Trent Hastings, a reclusive author of popular crime novels.
