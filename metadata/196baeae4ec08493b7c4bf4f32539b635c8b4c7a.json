It marked a major \nturning point in Carlos Santana's career as it was a sharp departure from his critically \nacclaimed first three albums. Original bassist David Brown left the group in 1971 and was \nreplaced by Doug Rauch and Tom Rutley, while original percussionist Michael Carabello left and \nwas replaced by Armando Peraza. Keyboardist/vocalist Gregg Rolie, who was having a falling-out \nwith Santana, was replaced by Tom Coster on a few songs. Caravanserai reached the top 10 of the \nBillboard 200 chart in 1972.\n\nThe sound contrasted greatly with Santana's trademark fusion of salsa, rock, and jazz, and \nconcentrated mostly on jazz-like instrumental passages. All but three tracks were instrumentals, \nand consequently the album yielded no hit singles. The album is the first among a series of Santana \nalbums that were known for their increasing musical complexity, marking a move away from the popular \nrock format of the early Santana albums towards a more contemplative and experimental jazz sound. \nWhile Caravanserai is regarded as an artistic success, the musical changes that began on its release \nin 1972 marked the start of a slide in Santana's commercial popularity.\n\nIt was the last Santana album to feature Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon, who went on to form Journey \nthe following year.\n\n\n   1.
