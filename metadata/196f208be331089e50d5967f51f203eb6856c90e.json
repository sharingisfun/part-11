The album sat in record stores collecting dust for over a year before its third single, &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; (best known for its lyric &quot;Tell me all your thoughts on God/'Cause I really want to meet her&quot;), became a number one smash on rock and alternative radio. The album contains a set of well-crafted songs (notably &quot;Haze&quot; and &quot;Give&quot;) with rich guitar textures, complemented by vocalist J.R. Richards' silky vibrato. &quot;Charlie Brown's Parents&quot; is another fine song that became a live favorite, though it failed to repeat the previous single's sales success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196f208be331089e50d5967f51f203eb6856c90e","amp;dn":"Dishwalla+-+Pet+Your+Friends+%5B1995%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196f208be331089e50d5967f51f203eb6856c90e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,111,32,139,227,49,8,158,80,213,150,127,81,242,3,235,104,86,201,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
