Requiring no technical or legal expertise, the book explains complicated concepts in clear, straightforward language.\r\n\r\nThe authorsâ€•two renowned experts on computer security and lawâ€•explore the well-established connection between social norms, privacy, security, and technological structure. This approach is the key to understanding information security and informational privacy, providing a practical framework to address ethical and legal issues. The authors also discuss how rapid technological developments have created novel situations that lack relevant norms and present ways to develop these norms for protecting informational privacy and ensuring sufficient information security.\r\n\r\nBridging the gap among computer scientists, economists, lawyers, and public policy makers, this book provides technically and legally sound public policy guidance about online privacy and security. It emphasizes the need to make trade-offs among the complex concerns that arise in the context of online privacy and security","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1977015d49d5985a58783333fc50ca90f53e680c","amp;dn":"Unauthorized+Access+-+1st+Ed+%282013%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1977015d49d5985a58783333fc50ca90f53e680c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,119,1,93,73,213,152,90,88,120,51,51,252,80,202,144,245,62,104,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
