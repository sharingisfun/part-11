As his physical and psychological travails took an ever greater toll on him, his performances became increasingly erratic, sometimes difficult to watch, as he often virtually self-destructed right before one's eyes. \n\nFortunately, the too-appropriately titled IN PAIN--which features various European live performances from 1994 to 1996--cherry-picks the most intense, rewarding moments from Van Zandt's last haunted years. \n\nThe ghosts gaining on the singer's soul give the songs an added weight. The harrowing struggle against existential pain in Nothin', written early in Van Zandt s career, seems here like a self-fulfilling prophecy. You Are Not Needed Now, Townes' ode to the late Janis Joplin, could be his own eulogy, eerily delivered in advance of his passing. Even the tender ballad Katie Belle Blues, written for Van Zandt s daughter, gains in poignancy given the darkened context in which it appears. \n\nThere are several live Van Zandt albums, but when it comes to the latter-day ones, IN PAIN is as good as any. \n\nRecorded live at \nthe Bahnfof Langendreer Club, Bochum, Germany in November 1994 &amp; November 1996; \nthe Starclub, Dresden, Germany, Germany in November 1996; \nthe Muffathalle Club, Munich, Germany in November 1995; \nthe Szene Wien Club, Vienna, Austria in November 1996. \n16 Solo Performaces;European Concerts From 1994 &amp; 1996 \n\nPersonnel includes: Townes Van Zandt (vocals, guitar); \nHans Theessink (guitar); \nWolfgang Pracht (slide guitar, dobro).\n\n\n01 Katie Belle Blues\n02 Buckskin Stallion\n03 Loretta\n04 Snowin On Raton\n05 Nothin\n06 Gone to Long\n07 To Live s To Fly\n08 Highway Kind\n09 Mr. Mudd &amp; Mr. Gold\n10 Lover s Lullaby\n11 White Freight Liner\n12 You Are Not Needed Now\n13 Rex s Blues\n14 Stopping Off Place\n15 Alone and Forsaken\n16 You Got To Move","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b1eb64b90993a0a2efb7671528dc66ed8ae85b","amp;dn":"Townes+Van+Zandt+-+2000+-+In+Pain+-+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b1eb64b90993a0a2efb7671528dc66ed8ae85b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,177,235,100,185,9,147,160,162,239,183,103,21,40,220,102,237,138,232,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
