Translated from the Swedish by John Tate.\n\nISBN: 1565843592 | 192 pages | PDF\n\n\n&quot;Exterminate All the Brutes&quot; is a searching examination of Europe's dark history in Africa and the origins of genocide. Using Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as his point of departure, Sven Lindqvist takes us on a haunting tour through the colonial past, interwoven with a modern-day travelogue. Retracing the steps of European explorers, missionaries, politicians, and historians in Africa from the late eighteenth century onward, the author exposes the roots of genocide in Africa via his own journey through the Saharan desert. As Lindqvist shows, fantasies not merely of white superiority but of actual extermination -- &quot;cleansing&quot; the earth of the so-called lesser races -- deeply informed European colonialism and racist ideology that ultimately culminated in Europe's own Holocaust.\n\nChosen as one of the Best Books of 1998 by the New Internationalist, which called it &quot;a beautifully written integration of criticism, cultural history, and travel writing, underpinned by a passion for social justice,&quot; &quot;Exterminate All the Brutes&quot; is a powerful reckoning with the past and an indispensable contribution to the literature of colonial Africa and European genocide.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;A book of stunning range and near genius. . . The catastrophic consequences of European imperialism are made palpable in the personal progress of the author, a late-twentieth century pilgrim in Africa. Lindqvist's astonishing connections across time and cultures, combined with a marvelous economy of prose, leave the reader appalled, reflective, and grateful.&quot; -- David Levering Lewis\n\n&quot;Lindqvist's disturbing, brilliant work of historical sleuthing deserves to be taken up in a thousand classrooms.&quot; -- Rob Nixon, Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;In spare but powerful prose . . . Lindqvist manages to weave together an impressive variety of themes [to] point to the continuity between prejudices and acts separated by continents and centuries.&quot; -- Washington Post\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19d0a98c2b92ecf026da31328cb087dcb8e65868","amp;dn":"Sven+Lindqvist+-+Exterminate+All+the+Brutes+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19d0a98c2b92ecf026da31328cb087dcb8e65868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,208,169,140,43,146,236,240,38,218,49,50,140,176,135,220,184,230,88,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
