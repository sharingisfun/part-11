ISBN 1-55690-027-9\n\nI could not find this recording in digital format,\nso I converted my copy of this recording to MP3.\nFrom audio cassette (Nakamichi Dragon) to CD \n(Pioneer PDR-555RW) to MP3 (iTunes 8, 96kbps VBR).\n\nDolby NR was NOT used.\nSome might say it's brighter without it, \nmore muddled with it... you can post-process or\nequalize to your liking.\n\nFrank Muller is (was), in my opinion, the best book\non tape reader, ever. Stephen King was quoted saying\n(something to the effect) that sometimes when he wrote, \nhe heard Frank Muller's voice reading it.\n(His reading of &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; is a wonderful).\n\nCheers, FerraBit\nJanuary 2009\n\nLinks:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt_Pupil\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Muller\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e578abebffa5f668e7b64d75e1ff09122f513b","amp;dn":"APT+PUPIL+-+Stephen+King.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e578abebffa5f668e7b64d75e1ff09122f513b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,229,120,171,235,255,165,246,104,231,182,77,117,225,255,9,18,47,81,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
