Released in 2004, it is the direct sequel to Need for Speed: Underground, and is part of the Need for Speed series, available on GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, wii and Windows. It was developed by EA Black Box. Like its predecessor, it was also commercially successful, and sold nine million copies worldwide.\n\nThe game is based around tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;explore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; mode (just driving around freely, like the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Bayview\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;). Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player through the story.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows\n\n    Windows 98 or better\n    933 MHz CPU\n    128 MB RAM for 98/ME (256 MB RAM for 2000/XP)\n    2 GB hard disk space\n    DirectX 9.0c compatible 32 MB AGP graphics card with Transform and lighting and one of these chipsets Radeon 7500; GeForce 2; Matrox G400; Matrox Parhelia; SIS 315\n    DirectX compatible sound card\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e5fb0f88c0b7eb969b6536a95b35279e8c13ef","amp;dn":"need+for+speed+underground+2+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e5fb0f88c0b7eb969b6536a95b35279e8c13ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,229,251,15,136,192,183,235,150,155,101,54,169,91,53,39,158,140,19,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
