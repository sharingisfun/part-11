Originally known as the Orbits, the group formed in Toledo, OH, in 1958 and was led by saxophonist Johnny Paris; other members included organist Paul Tesluk, guitarist Dave Yorko, bassist Lionel &quot;Butch&quot; Mattice, and drummer Tony Kaye. After a stint recording with rockabilly singer Mack Vickery, the group traveled to Detroit, hoping to become a backing band for up-and-coming singers. However, a pair of music promoters, Harry Balk and Irving Michanik, signed them as a group on their own, and they recorded their first single, &quot;Crossfire,&quot; for the Twirl label in 1959. &quot;Crossfire&quot; went to number 23 and the group moved to the Warwick imprint for &quot;Red River Rock,&quot; a rock &amp; roll instrumental of the standard &quot;Red River Valley&quot; that peaked at number five. The Hurricanes responded to their success with more of the same, delivering &quot;Reveille Rock,&quot; &quot;Rockin' Goose,&quot; &quot;Revival,&quot; and &quot;Beatnik Fly&quot; over the next year, touring extensively all the while. Eventually the pace -- and lack of further hit singles -- caught up with the group, and Johnny &amp; the Hurricanes disbanded in 1965. Paris moved to Hamburg, started his own label, Atila, and in 1970 formed a new Hurricanes lineup that toured until November 2005, two weeks before Paris took ill and was hospitalized. He died on May 1, 2006, due to pneumonia and septic blood after a splenectomy.\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:39frxqu5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:39frxqu5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI was not able to find this album at All Music.\n\nFor sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00145WUFI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00145WUFI&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
