She signed to Warner Music Group since 1993. Dubbed the &quot;Queen of Italian pop&quot; by entertainment news outlets, Pausini is famed for her soulful voice and romantic ballads. She is also known for multilingual music productions that span five languagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½her native Italian, Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.\n\nPausini debuted at the 43rd Annual Sanremo Music Festival in 1993. Her first place victory in the competition's New Talent division helped launch her music career in Europe. She tapped the hispanophone and lusophone markets in Ibero-America with crossover recordings. Since 1996, she has concurrently released SpanishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“language companion editions with her vernacular studio albumsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;a practice that [has] come to define her career and compound her success&quot;. In 2001, she recapped eight years of success with a greatest hits album, issued in the two customary editionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Italian and Spanish. Following an English-language crossover attempt in 2002, Pausini returned with the galvanizing studio album Escucha (2004). The recording garnered a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2006.\n\nAs of March 2009, Pausini maintains worldwide record sales in excess of 60 million. In 2004, with Pausini's sales tally at only 25 million, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered this &quot;an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative EnglishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“language market&quot;.\n\n1 Las Cosas Que Vives\n\n2 Escucha a Tu Corazon\n\n3 Inolvidable\n\n4 Cuando Se Ama\n\n5 Angeles en el Cielo\n\n6 Lo Siento\n\n7 Dos Enamorados\n\n8 Que Historia es?\n\n9 16/5/74\n\n10 Un Dia Sin Ti\n\n11 La Voce\n\n12 El Mundo que Sone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1bd9aa9caf18a6c8189e39316e496b97aa732f","amp;dn":"Laura+Pausini%5BLe+Cose+Che+vivi-1996-mp3-320k+m3u-winker%40kidzcorn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1bd9aa9caf18a6c8189e39316e496b97aa732f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,27,217,170,156,175,24,166,200,24,158,57,49,110,73,107,151,170,115,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
