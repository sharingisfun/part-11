Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFrom RecordedBooks.com:\n\nNew York Times best-selling author Bernard Cornwell is perhaps the most popular \nhistorical fiction novelist in the world. \n\nIn The Fort, a small British garrison and three sloops-of-war protect the \nunfinished Fort George in 1779. As a bold show of force, Massachusetts sends \n900 soldiers and 42 ships toward the fort to obliterate the redcoats and \nenergize the American Revolution.\n\n&quot;Cornwell's historical accuracy is excellent.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Diana Gabaldon\n\n\nFrom HarperCollins.com:\n\n&quot;The most prolific and successful historical novelist in the world today.&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Wall Street Journal\n\n&quot;Readers who havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t discovered Bernard Cornwell donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what they are missing.&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½New York Times bestselling author Vince Flynn \n\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of Agincourt, The Saxon Tales, and the \nbeloved Richard Sharpe series, Bernard CornwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Fort plunges prow-first into \nthe largest naval clash of the Revolutionary War. Fans of The Nathaniel Starbuck \nChronicles and The Burning Land will thrill to CornwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s triumphant return to \nAmerican historical fiction in this gripping story of courage, strength and \npatriotism.\nBook Description\nWhile the major fighting of the war moves to the south in the summer of 1779, a \nBritish force of fewer than a thousand Scottish infantry, backed by three \nsloops-of-war, sails to the desolate and fog-bound coast of New England. \nEstablishing a garrison and naval base at Penobscot Bay, in the eastern province \nof Massachusetts that would become Maine, the ScotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the only British troops \nbetween Canada and New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½harry rebel privateers and give shelter to American \nloyalists.\n\nIn response, Massachusetts sends a fleet of more than forty vessels and some one \nthousand infantrymen to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcaptivate, kill or destroyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the foreign invaders. Second \nin command is Peleg Wadsworth, a veteran of the battles at Lexington and Long \nIsland, once aide to General Washington, and a man who sees clearly what must be \ndone to expel the invaders.\n\nBut ineptitude and irresolution lead to a mortifying defeatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and have stunning \nrepercussions for two men on opposite sides: an untested eighteen-year-old \nScottish lieutenant named John Moore, who will begin an illustrious military \ncareer; and a Boston silversmith and patriot named Paul Revere, who will face \ncourt-martial for disobedience and cowardice.\n\nGrounded firmly in history, inimitably told in Cornwell's thrilling narrative \nstyle, The Fort is the extraordinary novel of this fascinating clash between a \nsuperpower and a nation in the making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5ead816130e54b380af765b44b65f232b92f65","amp;dn":"THE+FORT+-+Bernard+Cornwell.+Read+by+Robin+Bowerman+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5ead816130e54b380af765b44b65f232b92f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,94,173,129,97,48,229,75,56,10,247,101,180,75,101,242,50,185,47,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
