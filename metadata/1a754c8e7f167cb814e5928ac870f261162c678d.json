His UCLA teams reached unprecedented heights in the 1960s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s capped by a run of ten NCAA championships in twelve seasons and an eighty-eight-game winning streak, records that stand to this day. Wooden also became a renowned motivational speaker and writer, revered for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pyramid of Success.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSeth Davis of Sports Illustrated and CBS Sports has written the definitive biography of Wooden, an unflinching portrait that draws on archival research and more than two hundred interviews with players, opponents, coaches, and even Wooden himself. Davis shows how hard Wooden strove for success, from his All-American playing days at Purdue through his early years as a high school and college coach to the glory days at UCLA, only to discover that reaching new heights brought new burdens and frustrations. \n\nDavis also reveals how at the pinnacle of his career Wooden found himself on questionable ground with alumni, referees, assistants, and even some of his players. His was a life not only of lessons taught, but also of lessons learned.\nWoven into the story as well are the players who powered WoodenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s championship teams Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Walt Hazzard, and others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many of whom speak frankly about their coach. The portrait that emerges from DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable biography is of a man in full, whose life story still resonates today.\n\nGenre: Biography, Memoirs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a754c8e7f167cb814e5928ac870f261162c678d","amp;dn":"Wooden%3A+A+Coach%27s+Life+by+Seth+Davis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a754c8e7f167cb814e5928ac870f261162c678d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,117,76,142,127,22,124,184,20,229,146,138,200,112,242,97,22,44,103,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
