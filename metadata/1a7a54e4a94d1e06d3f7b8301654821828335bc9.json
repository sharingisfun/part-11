They arrive in the Space Station Texas for refueling but they have problems while landing in Venus. Without communication, another rocket is launched with Commander Brendan Lockhart, Andre Ferneau and Hans Walter to rescue the first team and explore the planet. They use a vehicle to seek Kern and Sherman, but they are attacked by a flying reptile. They kill the animal without knowing that it is worshiped and considered the God Terah by Venusians women that use their powerful connection with nature to destroy the invaders. Meanwhile John helps the two cosmonauts to survive in the hostile land.\n\nWe can stop off on this planet for a vacation. As long as their not TOO prehistoric. But they seem fine from the photo :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7a54e4a94d1e06d3f7b8301654821828335bc9","amp;dn":"Voyage+To+The+Planet+Of+Prehistoric+Women","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7a54e4a94d1e06d3f7b8301654821828335bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,122,84,228,169,77,30,6,211,247,184,48,22,84,130,24,40,51,91,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
