She has an old debt to settle with her brother the Devil. Taking Claire from him after losing her years ago is just icing on the cake.\n\nWill Claire win her freedom, and save herself from the Devil? Or be trapped by Mab forever?\n\nGenre: Urban Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa2fae54a66d6c3eb29d89de6a42fd155453d9b","amp;dn":"Dark+Hope+by+H.+D.+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa2fae54a66d6c3eb29d89de6a42fd155453d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,162,250,229,74,102,214,195,235,41,216,157,230,164,47,209,85,69,61,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
