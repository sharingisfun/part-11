The integrity of WagnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters has been preserved and RackhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustrations add another dimension, helping bring the characters to life while also portraying the fantastic settings that form the backdrop to the drama. \n\nThis book is a must have to accompany listening to, or watching, The Ring Cycle being performed. It's best viewed in color on Kindle for iPhone/iPad/iPod, Android/Blackberry or Kindle for PC or other devices where you can make the most of RackhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s color illustrations. (Standard Kindle is currently black and white only).\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nNote: Tested all chapter (internal and ereader application) links of both volumes in both file types. I used Calibre for PC, Moon+ Reader and Aldiko for the epub files, and Kindle for PC and Kindle for Android for the mobi. \n\n\n                         PLEASE SEED - THANK YOU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ae31341dcc9142f3ad73596d7556efa9470c35f","amp;dn":"The+Ring+of+the+Nibelung+Volume+1+and+2+Dan+McGlaun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ae31341dcc9142f3ad73596d7556efa9470c35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,227,19,65,220,201,20,47,58,215,53,150,215,85,110,250,148,112,195,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
