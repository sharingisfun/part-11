All Add-ons are tested by me personally with RailWorks2 v114.1b an works great! If you want to download RailWorks, I advise you to download the &quot;RailWorks.2-SKIDROW&quot; torrent here on the TPB which is version v114.0b and update it with the upgrade in this torrent (v114.0b_to_v114.1b.rar), that works fine for me. It's possible that the files also works with an older version of RailWorks or even with RailSimulator, but I hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t test that so I can't guarantee anything. Of course these Add-ons works also on a legal version of RailWorks, but please note that every time Steam updates RailWorks the Assets that comes with RailWorks will be overwritten! Have fun with it! \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to install?\nAt first extract the *.rar file with WinRar or something else, then there are two options:\n-   *.rar file contains a *.rwp file; Install this using the Package Manager in Railworks by pressing &quot;Install&quot; in the &quot;Package Manager&quot; tab and select the extracted *.rwp file, RailWorks will install the Assets now, if ask overwrite existing Assets.\n-   *.rar file contains &quot;Assets&quot; and/or &quot;Content&quot; and/or some other folders; copy the folders to the main folder of RailWorks for example &quot;C:\\Program Files\\RailSimulator.com\\RailWorks 2&quot;, if ask overwrite existing folders and files.\nNow you can use the installed Add-on in RailWorks, sometimes it's needed that you delete all &quot;Blueprint.pak&quot; files in the subfolders of the &quot;Assets&quot; directory to show up the installed Add-ons!\n\nNote: With some files there is an Readme.txt enclosed, please read that file carefully for installation instructions!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd-ons that are in the package (sorted on filename) for some Class xx locomotives, look also by the publisher of that loco:\n- 0-4-0ST Saddle Tank Locomotive\n- 3D Trains - Sante Fe F7 F-Units\n- 3D Trains - ScaleRoad\n- 7F Scenario Pack\n- A1 Tornado Steam Locomotive\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 1\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 2\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 3\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 4\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 5\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 6\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 7/8\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 9\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 10\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 11\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 12\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 13\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 14\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 15\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 16\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 166 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 37 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 37-9 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 40 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 43 MTU Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 43 Valenta Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 43 VP185 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 47 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 50 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 66 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - MK1 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - MK2 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - MK3 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Voyager Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Wagon Sound Pack\n- Billionair Benefactor Scenario\n- Black 5 Scenario Pack\n- BNSF Dash 9\n- BNSF Pack\n- Canadian National Locomotives\n- Challanger Steam Locomotive\n- Class 02\n- Class 08\n- Class 31\n- Class 37\n- Class 40\n- Class 47 NSE\n- Class 47\n- Class 101 DMU\n- Class 158 DMU\n- Class 170 DMU\n- Class 380 EMU\n- Class 390 EMU\n- Canadian National SD40-2 Wide Nose\n- Coach and wagon sounds\n- Diesel Shunter Pack\n- DigitalTraction - British Railways 4MT\n- DigitalTraction - Mark 1 Coaches\n- DigitalTraction - Mark 2e Coaches\n- DigitalTraction - Wagon Pack 01\n- Doncaster Works\n- Falmouth Branch\n- Flying Scotsman\n- Fort Kent to Eagle Lake\n- Fowler 4F Steam Locomotive\n- German Railroads - Class 143 at work\n- German Railroads - Freight Traffic\n- German Railroads - MegaPack\n- German Railroads - Moderne Kesselwagen\n- German Railroads - Moderne SchnellzÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ge - Baureihe 120\n- German Railroads - Wagons\n- Glasgow Airport Rail Link\n- Green and Gold HST\n- Gresley V2 2-6-2 Steam Locomotive\n- G-TraX - BerkNorthern &amp;
