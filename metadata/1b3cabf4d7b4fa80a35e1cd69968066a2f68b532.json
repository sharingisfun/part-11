The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the Tirpitz, to return to home waters rather than having a safe haven available on the Atlantic coast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b3cabf4d7b4fa80a35e1cd69968066a2f68b532","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Clarkson%3A+The+Greatest+Raid+Of+All+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b3cabf4d7b4fa80a35e1cd69968066a2f68b532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,60,171,244,215,180,250,128,163,94,28,214,153,104,6,106,47,104,181,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
