The madwoman in question is the extremely eccentric Countess Aurelia (Katherine Hepburn). Roderick (Richard Chamberlain) is the peace-loving activist who, along with a local rag picker (Danny Kaye), warns the Countess of a plot to destroy the city. A quartet of villains led by the Chairman (Yul Brynner) are after the oil reserves that bubble under the water supply. Along with the Broker (Charles Boyer), the Commissar (Oscar Homolka), and the Prospector (Donald Pleasence), the evil developers plan to secure the oil rights to the region with or without the consent of the unsuspecting public. The Countess invites Josephine (Dame Edith Evans) to judge the villains, who are locked in the Countess's cellar for their crimes against the people of Paris in this lethargic film. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064621/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064621/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:06:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x384  1.88:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 924 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b483059776ca76df03e802d90d13927f993172f","amp;dn":"The+Madwoman+Of+Chaillot+%281969%29+Katharine+Hepburn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b483059776ca76df03e802d90d13927f993172f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,72,48,89,119,108,167,109,240,62,128,45,144,209,57,39,249,147,23,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
