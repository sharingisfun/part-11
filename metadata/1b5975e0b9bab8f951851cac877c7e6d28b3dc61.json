Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the later Middle Ages some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music). Chanting (e.g., mantra, sacred text, the name of God/Spirit, etc.) is a commonly used spiritual practice. Like prayer, chant may be a component of either personal or group practice. Diverse spiritual traditions consider chant a route to spiritual development.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5975e0b9bab8f951851cac877c7e6d28b3dc61","amp;dn":"Chants+Discography+1987-2010+%2814+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5975e0b9bab8f951851cac877c7e6d28b3dc61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,89,117,224,185,186,184,249,81,133,28,172,135,124,126,109,40,179,220,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
