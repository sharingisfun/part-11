It lampoons the ever popular TV cookery programmes and introduces dozens of faux cookery terms such as embarrass, frighten, etc.\n\nWhat sets it above other spoofs however, is that we learn more about the presenters - the Honourable Simon and Minty Marchmont, who present from the kitchen of their restaurant, The Quill and Tassel at Bray. We learn that Simon is gay, Minty the working class daughter of a publican, Minty would have liked children, their dog is a child substitute and so much more.\n\nThe writing - co-written by Arabella Weir who plays Minty - is first rate.\n\nThe audio quality is fine, but the video is probably a few generations away from the original indifferent quality rip, but still very watchable.\n\nEnjoy and laugh out loud as I do every time I see this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b665acf86526b30d20ab33b3a546e7be6eeab54","amp;dn":"Posh+Nosh+-+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b665acf86526b30d20ab33b3a546e7be6eeab54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,102,90,207,134,82,107,48,210,10,179,59,58,84,110,123,230,238,171,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
