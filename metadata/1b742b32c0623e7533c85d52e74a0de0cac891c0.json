The top notch array of talent on the album reads like a WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Who of Hip-Hop: Dr. Dre, Cypress HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s B-Real, RZA and GZA/Genius from the Wu-Tang Clan, the FugeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Wyclef (a good friend of MuggÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d done a remix of CypressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoom Biddy Bye ByeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Goodie Mobb, KRS-One, Mobb Deep, Infamous Mobb, MC Eiht, and LA The Darkman. Understandably, the artistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ conflicting schedules made creating the album an often tricky proposition while the diversity of their styles added to the spontaneity and musical magic of the project.\n\nWorking with talented young guns as well as some of the most established MCs in the biz not only allowed Muggs to conjure some bona fide hip-hop magic on tape, the experience personally provided him with a fresh perspective, one which he says will no doubt pay off in dividends on the next Cypress Hill extravaganza.\n\nBy maintaining a varied musical diet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which includes everything from brooding British trip-hop to seething alternative music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Muggs is continually absorbing new sounds and ideas, blending them together, and taking them to the next level of expression. With plenty more dope beats stashed away in the vault until they propel Cypress Hill and the Soul Assassins to even higher plateaus for the next millennium, DJ Muggs is a hip-hop icon who wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop rocking until long after he retires.\n\nShare and Enjoy:\n\n\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\nDJ MUGGS AND PLANET ASIA ARE PAINLANGUAGE - MIXTAPE\n\n\nmp3 320kbs\nTracklist\n\n1 - Intro\n\n2 - God &amp; Satan\n\n3 - Shadows Of Hell\n\n4 - Nine Milli\n\n5 - Going In\n\n6 - Like That\n\n7 - Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk\n\n8 - Who Can Fuck With Us?\n\n9 - Spazz Out\n\n10 - Slang Museum\n\n11 - Respect Mine\n\n12 - Southern Dreams\n\n13 - Cops And Coke Sales (Freestyle)\n\n14 - Dunn Dunn\n\n15 - ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s What It Is\n\n16 - Top Shelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n......................................................................................................................\nDJ SOLO - Open Up The Trunk (Split Tracks)\n\n\nI just finished my latest mixtape called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Up The TrunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that features new artists (Cool Kids, Pac Div, Dyme Def, Tha Weirdos, U-N-I, The Pack, Play) who are repping for bass-heavy hip-hop, along with a lot of old school beats that inspired their style (Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, NWA, The Clipse, etc). IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been noticing over the past year or so, a lot of cats who are combining the 80s sound of 808 drum machines and what is considered the commercial sound with a kick and a clap production, dirtying it up and forging the new sound of underground hip-hop. This is nothin but bangin beats for the trunk, real emceein, real DJin and a few exclusives, freestyles, classic DJ SOLO remixes and you even get to hear your boy SOLO rap!

Originally, this mixtape was supposed to be released along with a limited edition shirt in promotion of the Mask &amp; The Assassin album. Due to some problems, that never happened and the mixtape got shelved for a minute. It exists and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m working on getting it to the people because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dope and I know cats want to hear it. It featured unreleased Psycho Realm tracks, original DJ SOLO remixes and mashups, and lots of classic SA &amp; PR music to get you sick and lifted. This mashup here is from a song off the Terror Tapes and I put it over the Funkdoobiest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBow Wow WowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ beat on the mixtape.

It features an impressively hard hitting collection of beats and rhymes. All in all, you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ask for a better Soul Assassins compilation. The lineup features: Mitchy Slick, Rass Kass w Alchemist, Muggs vs GZA, Self Scientific, Diz Gibran, Eddie Raplife, Expensive Taste, and more. Highlights include the Muggs vs GZA joint, and the homie Diz GibranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s banger donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sleep on the banger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe City (LA).ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 14 tracks deep.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nmp3 192kbs\n\ntracklisting\n1 Intro\n1.0 Same OG (Featuring Casual)\n1.1 Make It 8 Miles\n1.2 The Game (Featuring Nate Dogg)\n1.3 Haze &amp; Hash (Featuring Alchemist)\n1.4 Gangster\n1.5 Money All The Time (Featuring Junior M.A.F.I.A.)\n1.6 Freestyle\n1.7 Front 2 Back (Featuring Mabarko)\n1.8 Fuego (Featuring La Bruha)\n19 For Real\n2 We All Die Someday (Lloyd Banks, Eminem &amp; 50 Cent)\n2.0 Freestyle\n3 Gorilla Hood.mp3\n4 Hightimes (Featuring Tha Eastsidaz)\n5 Gangstaville (Featuring Butch Cassidy)\n6 In The Hood (Featuring Brooklyn)\n7 Silent (Featuring Ghostface &amp; Streetlife)\n8 Gangster Gumbo (Featuring Roscoe &amp; Jayo Felony)\n9 Keep It Thoro-Remix\n\n\n\n.................................................................................................................\nDJ Solo Classics and Exclusives\n\n\n\n\nDJ SOLO - SOUL ASSASSINS Classic &amp; Exclusive\nIn case you never had the opportunity to see us at at a show where we were either selling or giving away our mixtapes, we are now posting them one by one for FREE download! This one is the Classic &amp; Exclusive Soul Assassins mix I did in 2006 (as seen in The Source) right when I first started working here at Soul Assassins/Angeles Records. I did this before I had Serato so it was all done with actual vinyl and a few CDs, suck on that, microwave DJs!! Obviously IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m critical of my own work and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not, in my opinion, my best, up to date, skill level of mixtape making, but it is a real dope mix that you can play in your car or bump at the house when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re chillin. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full of all the classic Soul Assassins songs a lot of us grew up on, including an unrelesed Cypress Hill track that Muggs dug out from his archives, an exclusive Sick Symphonies freestyle that Jack and Cynic did for me, a few original DJ SOLO mashup mixes that were really the origins of my mashup style that you hear today, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all hosted by DJ Muggs himself. Included in the download is the front and back cover art, and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mixtape, so if you burn it to a CD, make sure you put ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³ seconds between the tracks or youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have gaps. Otherwise, just drag it into your iTunes and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ready to ride and smoke!
