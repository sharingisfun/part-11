And there is also the mortal child Timothy, the foundling son who yearns to be like those he loves: to fly, to sleep in daytime, and to live forever. Instead, his task is to witness the family's struggle with the startling possibility of its own end.\n\nBradbury is deservedly recognized as a master of lyricism and delicate mood. In this novel he weaves together individuals' stories and the overarching family crisis into a softly whispered, seductive tale of longing and loss, death and life in the shadowy places\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9634.From_the_Dust_Returned?from_search=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9634.From_the_Dust_Returned?from_search=true&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb2b8b065ec521b59fc0f521eb559980c7aaa68","amp;dn":"Ray+Bradbury+-+From+the+Dust+Returned+%28retail%29+%28epub%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb2b8b065ec521b59fc0f521eb559980c7aaa68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,178,184,176,101,236,82,27,89,252,15,82,30,181,89,152,12,122,170,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
