Hutto and Hound Dog Taylor to George Thorogood and Eric Clapton.  The remaining thirty tracks may not be as well known, but there are several gems stacked away here, and the choice of songs is generally very sensible, although I would definitely have included &quot;Madison Blues&quot; and &quot;She's Got To Go&quot;. But apart from those two, virtually all of James' best songs are here.  Elmore James always sang like he meant it. His huge voice and intense vocal delivery makes him my favorite bluesman, along with the wonderful arrangements of his songs - you just can't get enough of Elmore's burning slide guitar coupled with a sax or two and the clanging piano of Johnny Jones or Ike Turner. Elmore truly rocked, and he did it years before the official birth of rock n' roll..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Coming Home\n[02] The Twelve Year Old Boy\n[03] It Hurts Me Too\n[04] Knocking At Your Door\n[05] Elmore's Contribution To Jazz\n[06] Cry For Me Baby\n[07] Take Me Where You Go\n[08] Dust My Broom\n[09] The Sky Is Crying\n[10] Baby Please Set A Date\n[11] Held My Baby Last Night\n[12] Rollin' And Tumblin'\n[13] Done Somebody Wrong\n[14] Fine Little Mama\n[15] I Can't Stop Lovin' You\n[16] Early One Morning\n[17] I Need You\n[18] Strange Angels\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:48m:51s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Stranger Blues\n[02] Bleeding Heart\n[03] Standing At The Crossroads\n[04] One Way Out\n[05] Got To Move\n[06] My Baby'S Gone\n[07] Find My Kinda Woman\n[08] Look On Yonder Wall\n[09] Shake Your Moneymaker\n[10] Mean Mistreatin' Mama\n[11] Sunnyland Train\n[12] I Have A Right To Love My Baby\n[13] Everyday I Have The Blues\n[14] So Unkind\n[15] Make My Dreams Come True\n[16] Talk To Me Baby\n[17] It Hurts Me Too\n[18] I Gotta Go Now\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:51m:07s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:40m:00s\nTotal File Size....................... 240mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
