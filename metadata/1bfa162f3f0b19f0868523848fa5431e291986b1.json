His powerfully composed, meticulously inked pages, often featuring grotesque creatures or scenes of ghastly destruction (and some of the greatest stiffly handsome/beautiful specimens of 1950s humanity ever put to paper), were a vital part of the allure of these classic comics.\n\nFeldstein's contributions to the first year and a half of ECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two SF titles, Weird Science and Weird Fantasy Ã¢â‚¬â€ comprising 16 classic O. Henry-style shock-ending stories with such evocative, vintage title as &quot;'Things' From Outer Space.&quot; &quot;The Flying Saucer Invasion,&quot; &quot;Spawn of Venus,&quot; &quot;Destruction of the Earth,&quot; and &quot;Am I Man or Machine?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ are collected in their integrity in this volume, along with a handful of bonus stories drawn by a few of Feldstein's oft-overlooked collaborators, including Graham Ingels, George Roussos, George Olesen, Max Elkan and Sid Check. This volume also boasts a new interview with Feldstein about his years at EC, focusing in particular in his work on these science fiction titles that were the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pride and joy (and were killed a few years later by the Comics Code)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bfa162f3f0b19f0868523848fa5431e291986b1","amp;dn":"Child+Of+Tomorrow+And+Other+Stories+%282014%29%28Digital%29%28TLK-EMPIRE-H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bfa162f3f0b19f0868523848fa5431e291986b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,250,22,47,63,11,25,240,134,133,35,132,143,165,67,30,41,25,134,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
