Each book is built up around fictitious families, tracing the major fashion developments of the period and comparing the clothing and lifestyle of the wealthy with that of those who cannot afford to dress fashionably. A date list will help the reader understand how historical events affect the kind of clothes people wear. Each book has a glossary, a list of places to visit and books to read to find out more about the costume of the period, and finishes with imaginative ideas for follow-up work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c497435e32dfc8b91050a5cbc4388632df048aa","amp;dn":"Costume+in+Context+-+The+Regency+%28Art+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c497435e32dfc8b91050a5cbc4388632df048aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,73,116,53,227,45,252,139,145,5,10,92,188,67,136,99,45,240,72,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
