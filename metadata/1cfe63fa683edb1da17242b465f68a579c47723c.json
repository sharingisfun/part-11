A little harmonica now and then, and a Dobro played with a bottleneck slide on the rollicking &quot;Glad to Get You Back,&quot; but that's it for ornamentation. Although most of 13 songs are Rush originals, he also essays three standards, Larry Williams' early rock classic &quot;Boney Maroney,&quot; Muddy Waters' &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,&quot; and, fearlessly, &quot;Howlin' Wolf&quot; itself, which he slows down into a funereal dirge. Rush calls his music &quot;folk funk,&quot; but in reality, Rush is the modern equivalent of the first country bluesmen, before the moves to Memphis and Chicago added full-band arrangements and electricity. But Rush isn't a hidebound traditionalist attempting to resurrect a past form for its own sake; Raw crackles with the energy of a musician who knows that he's working in the style that best suits his own personal gifts. This is a hundred times more listenable than yet another blues band plodding through a set of tenth-generation rewrites of &quot;Sweet Home Chicago,&quot; and could well be the blues recording of 2006.\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfe63fa683edb1da17242b465f68a579c47723c","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Bobby+Rush+-+Raw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfe63fa683edb1da17242b465f68a579c47723c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,254,99,250,104,62,219,29,161,114,66,180,101,246,138,87,156,71,114,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
