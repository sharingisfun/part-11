But when she's offered a costuming assistant's job on a docudrama in the hills near Moses Lake, she jumps at the chance. She's always dreamed of following in her director-father's footsteps, and the reenactment of the legendary frontier settlement of Wildwood is a first step. The family expectations will have to wait. But in 1861, the real Wildwood held dangerous realities. Town founder Harland Delevan held helpless residents, including young Irish schoolteacher Bonnie Rose, in an iron grip. Mysterious disappearances led to myths and legends still retold in the folk songs of Chinquapin Peaks. Eventually, the entire site was found abandoned. When strange connections surface between Allie and the teacher who disappeared over a century ago, everyone in Wildwood, including Allie's handsome neighbor on the film set, Blake Fulton, seems to be hiding secrets, and Allie doesn't know who she can trust. If she can't find the answers in time, history may repeat itself . . . with the most unthinkable results","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d031882a0eda4340454f4854a5ea5108c4afd4f","amp;dn":"Lisa+Wingate-Wildwood+Creek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d031882a0eda4340454f4854a5ea5108c4afd4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,3,24,130,160,237,164,52,4,84,244,133,74,94,165,16,140,74,253,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
