They display the influence of the American Underground, especially Robert Crumb, whose work had just reached France in the early 1970s. The stories were all published in various French magazines, just before the creation of the famous Metal Hurlant magazine in 1975.\nThe most famous of these stories is undoubtedly The Horny Goof. As with The Airtight Garage, we have chosen to retain the title by which this story is best kncwn in America, although a better translation of its original French title (Le Bandard Fou )would be the Wild Horny Pecker.\nWhatever its title, The Horny Goof is interesting on several levels: its combination of bawdy humor and fairly sophisticated science-fiction is a rare one, a style best done by Philip Jose Farmer. Those who love comics in-jokes will delight in finding, on pages 11 and 12, an homage to the pirate Red-Beard, a character created by Jean-Michel Charlier and Victor Hubinon, but also known for his hilarious, disastrous encounters with the indomitable Asterix and Obelix.\nLast but not least is the fact that the story is a prequel of sorts to The Airtight Garage. Flower, the artificially-expanded pleasure asteroid which we discover at the end, eventually becomes the first level of Major GrubertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s private creation. For this, and more about Lady Kowalsky read The Airtight Garage, pages 92 seq., and Airtight Garage spin-off comic-book series, such as The Elsewhere Prince, The Onyx Overlord, etc.\nSixteen years ago, few guessed that the relative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ caused in France by the original publication of The Horny Goof was also the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbig bangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the creation of the Moebius Universe.\nWhich is still expanding today&quot;\n\nThis is the second in a series of 10 Moebius compilations. Allthough it is titled Moebius 0, it was published after Graphitti design's 'Early Moebius', which is titled Moebius Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½.\n\nI will be uploading every one of them as fast as I can (having to work as any other regular guy during the daytime).\n\nEnjoy\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nATTENTION FELLOW PIRATES:\n\nSome *ssholes are performing automated swarm attacks on mine and other users torrents.
