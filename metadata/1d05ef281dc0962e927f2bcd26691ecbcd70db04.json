He became fascinated with fat loss and the hormonal control of fat and muscle. The diet he created relies upon the idea of dividing your day up into two distinct phases and maximising the power of both with diet and training. Phase one is a concentrated fat burning phase, the second phase of the day is the muscle building one where you maximise the anabolic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ muscle building Ã¢â‚¬â€œ response to training, and support recovery (and growth if desired) with a big hit of nutrients. In essence:\n\n- A Low carb, lower calorie AM phase: from rise until 3pm\n\n- A high carb, high calorie PM phase: 4pm until bed\n\n- Training between the two, 3-4pm\n\n- Skipping breakfast\n\n- On non-training days to stick more to the lower carb diet with one carb meal in the PM\n\nIn fact CBL is not only an all-out muscle gain diet but one that can be altered to give lean mass or fat loss with minimal muscle and performance loss.\n\n=====================\nThe Fat Burning Phase\n=====================\n\nIn this AM phase you eat mostly protein and fats and avoid carbs, you skip breakfast and have a relatively small lunch of meat and vegetables.\n\nThis phase is reliant upon the idea that not eating much at the beginning of the day and staying away from carbs completely will carry on the naturally higher rate of fat burning you see in the body in the mornings.\n\nThe usual advice of course is to eat carbs in the morning, because in theory youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Ã¢â‚¬Ëœburn it offÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ through the day and also because Ã¢â‚¬ËœyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more insulin sensitive so store it in muscle betterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Keifer argues against this. Fat cells also have high insulin sensitivity in the morning, so theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll suck up carbs and store them as fat. As for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœburning off carbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the CBL argument is that you want to burn body fat and store carbs in muscle to provide energy for training.\n\n=========================\nThe Muscle Building Phase\n=========================\n\nThis is the later, after training phase. This is the time where you Ã¢â‚¬Ëœback loadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ your day with both the calories and nutrients you need to build muscle. Straight after training you have some easily absorbed liquid protein and sugars then one hour later the feasting starts. You switch from low carb and fairly low calories, to high carb, protein and calories for the rest of the day with minimal fat.\n\nLater in the day both fat and muscle cells arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so responsive to insulin, so wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so easily take up carbs but hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the important bit, after training muscle cells literally suck up carbs (as well as the amino acids from the protein foods) with or without insulin so in effect they grab the lionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s share of all the foods youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eat in the evening after training. You feed muscle and starve fat. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also why you can relax and have a little Ã¢â‚¬ËœjunkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nYes, high GI Ã¢â‚¬ËœjunkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ type carbs are actually preferred, as Kiefer states you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a long insulin release that slow absorbing carbs give, but a short sharp spike which he argues is preferable for supporting muscle without too much fat gain.\n\n================================\nA Typical Carb Back Loading Plan\n================================\n\n0700: Wake, water, coffee. No breakfast.\n\n1100: First meal, meat or fish, vegetables and healthy fats, e.g. ribeye steak, broccoli\n\n1400: 25g whey protein with coconut oil\n\n1500: Training\n\n1600: Training ends. 30g whey protein, 20-40g simple sugars, e.g. Re-Charge Drink, scoop of whey.\n\n1700: chicken sandwich with salad on white bread. Choco type cereal with skim milk\n\n2000: Pizza with extra lean meat, salad, pastry.\n\n2200: Formula 80 with low fat milk\n\n============================\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n============================\n\nCBL has some real advantages as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lots of contrast which breaks the usual diet monotony. Sometimes you have to eat less, but other times you get to really go for it. You also get to eat both high carb and higher fat meals, so nothing is off the menu, and of course the treat foods element is a big sell for some people.\n\nHowever there are disadvantages as the optimum timing of exercise, and the types of foods that go around it is fairly set in stone, this means for many itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not flexible enough. Also the type of training is more centred around muscle building and away from sports and pursuits like CrossFit where longer high intensity sessions and more varied training is used.\n\n================\nSo does it work?\n================\n\nIf you have a quick trawl through the internet you get a variety of impressive success stories so the answer would seem to be yes, but whether it will work for you is dependent as ever on whether the structure first your lifestyle, needs and goals. The main things to think about here are the timing demands and the types of training you enjoy and need to do.\n\nIf CBL doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit you needs though donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t throw it out completely. Having the majority of your carbs in the post workout period Ã¢â‚¬â€œ regardless of the time you train Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is widely accepted as a sensible way to go after lean muscle and performance whilst reducing the risk of fat gain.\n\n\nPS:\n\nThis is a good book on diet that the seller made lots of effort against being pirated. Lots of mirror sites that promise a download and redirect to a sale page, all true sources taken down or deleted because of a legal complaint. It was a nice hunt to pirate this one, after two hours of search I finally got it on a russianclone, VK. Decided to share for everybody.\n\nBuy it if you want to support the author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d05ef281dc0962e927f2bcd26691ecbcd70db04","amp;dn":"Carb+Back-Loading+by+John+Kiefer+v1_0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d05ef281dc0962e927f2bcd26691ecbcd70db04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,5,239,40,29,192,150,46,146,127,43,205,38,105,30,203,205,112,219,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
