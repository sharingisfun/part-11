Or possibly even nauseous at the naked, conspicuous consumption.\nA woman who sells caviar for a living arranges a tasting at a Russian-owned luxury goods shop that specialises in life's essentials, such as an Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£18,500, 18-carat, white-gold baby's dummy (&quot;one of our bestsellers&quot;). \nIn a Mayfair club the barman fondles a bottle of 1811 cognac that goes for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£5,000 a glass. Not to just anyone, mind you. &quot;It's not about the money,&quot; he says, &quot;[it's about] 'Do you deserve the spirit?'&quot;\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThis two-part documentary follows the companies who cater to them, with the opening episode examining how businesses must adapt and fight harder than ever before to win a foothold in this lucrative new market.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe conclusion of the documentary following the companies who cater to Britain's super-rich clients examines how competition for the attention of the mega-wealthy is driving innovation. Suppliers must deliver more than just food as their customers have already eaten in all the best restaurants, meaning it's the exclusivity of the dining experience that counts and the story behind the ingredients that matters.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2c64454b446c6018021d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3176 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160kbs VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0719f573923624a75bbdfbd005b4d53e1766c0","amp;dn":"The.Worlds.Most.Expensive.Food.1of2.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0719f573923624a75bbdfbd005b4d53e1766c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,7,25,245,115,146,54,36,167,91,189,251,208,5,180,213,62,23,102,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
