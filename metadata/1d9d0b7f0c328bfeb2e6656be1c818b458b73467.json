For each 50-minute program, the intrepid duo takes an irreverent, non-academic approach to their subject, the art of illusion as practiced primarily by street performers. In Beijing, they observe the bowl and mask tricks. Then it's off to Cairo for cups and balls, which silent partner Teller actually talks about (just not in public). Next it's Alexandria for snake swallowing, Delhi for the handkerchief trick, and Calcutta for the Indian rope trick (some of these are not for the squeamish). Along the way, they share some of their specialties, like fire eating (Penn) and the needle trick (Teller), but are careful not to give any secrets away. Penn &amp; Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour explores culture and history as much as sleight of hand, resulting in a series as enlightening as it is entertaining. --Kathleen C. Fennessy\n\nProgram Description\nJoin the maverick masters of illusion as they trek to China, India, and Egypt, and witness astounding feats of magic and other inexplicable things.
