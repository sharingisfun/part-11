Dominated by Colin Blunstone's breathy vocals, choral backup harmonies, and Rod Argent's shining jazz- and classical-influenced organ and piano, the band sounded utterly unique for their era. Indeed, their material -- penned by either Argent or guitarist Chris White, with unexpected shifts from major to minor keys -- was perhaps too adventurous for the singles market. To this day, they're known primarily for their three big hit singles, &quot;She's Not There&quot; (1964), &quot;Tell Her No&quot; (1965), and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; (1969). Most listeners remain unaware that the group maintained a remarkably high quality of work for several years.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThis is a confusing album, not so much because of anything on it, but because an identically titled (and numbered) ten-song version, dating from 1992, also exists. While that shorter CD has its virtues, at the time of its release this 24-song compact disc was a surprisingly strong compilation, offering a good overview of the Zombies' overall output, up through the single &quot;Time of the Season.&quot; That includes not only the latter hit, but also &quot;She's Not There&quot; and &quot;Tell Her No,&quot; and their cover versions of &quot;Road Runner,&quot; &quot;Summertime,&quot; &quot;Going Out of My Head,&quot; and &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; (which segues in and out of &quot;Bring It on Home to Me&quot;), all interspersed with their equally worthy originals by Chris White, Colin Blunstone, and Rod Argent. The sound was very good by the standards of the time in which this was released, though it has obviously been outstripped several times over by a multitude of remastered compilations. The notes by John Tobler are also a bit brief and sketchy, but it's all still good listening two decades-plus on, and there are worse ways to discover the many permutations to this band's sound.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/collection-24-tracks-r1384996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/collection-24-tracks-r1384996&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000040L2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000040L2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
