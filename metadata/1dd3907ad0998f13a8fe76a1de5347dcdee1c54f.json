Starting with a piece of live action footage, we'll create a match move camera, then we'll set up rain and blowing leaves using Maya nParticles. We'll finish by rendering our simulations out in V-Ray and composite them over our footage in NUKE. After completing this Maya training, you'll have created your own dynamic weather elements, that'll help you effectively change the look and feel of your own videos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd3907ad0998f13a8fe76a1de5347dcdee1c54f","amp;dn":"DigitalTutors+-+Creating+and+Integrating+Weather+Elements+in+May","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd3907ad0998f13a8fe76a1de5347dcdee1c54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,211,144,122,208,153,143,19,168,254,118,161,222,83,71,220,222,225,197,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
