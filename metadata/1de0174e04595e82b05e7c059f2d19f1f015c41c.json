Your soldiers are being flanked\nand the perimeter is slowly collapsing under a vicious alien assault.\nRobotic turrets will not last much longer. Just a little more and the\nbugs will swarm into your unprotected base. What are your orders?\n\nYou order your soldiers to fall back to a defensive chokepoint and\nrebuild your defenses. Sacrifice the forward squads to gain some extra\ntime. Gather your team while equipping them with flamethrowers and laser\nguns. Start building a siege cannon for fire support. Then, while the\naliens are busy, flank their main hives to destroy and capture them.\n\nYou have just pulled off a tactical victory - but there's no time to rest.\n\nThe aliens are constantly mutating. One moment your shotguns are ripping\nthrough the horde, the next the aliens grow hard, bullet-proof armour.\nYou must adapt as well. Equip your team with stealth suits, miniguns,\ngrenade launchers - your commands will decide the battle's outcome.\n\n******************************\n*       Key Features:        \n******************************\n\n* Real time tactical combat\n* A lengthy campaign where you develop new weapons\n* Procedural maps and random mutation system keep the game fresh\n* 21 Human weapons and buildings for you to wield\n* 33 Alien mutations to keep you on your toes\n* Fight thousands of enemies at once\n\n*****************************\n*     Install Notes:        \n*****************************\n\n1.
