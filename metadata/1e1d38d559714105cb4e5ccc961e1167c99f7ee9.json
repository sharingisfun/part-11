Terry meets and is moved by a motor neurone disease sufferer who has chosen to stay in the UK and opted for hospice care; he struggles with the decision of a younger man with multiple sclerosis who has chosen to take his own life; he is particularly moved by Peter's (another motor neurone disease sufferer's) long journey to Dignitas, and finds watching the final stage extremely difficult.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1d38d559714105cb4e5ccc961e1167c99f7ee9","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+-+Choosing+to+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1d38d559714105cb4e5ccc961e1167c99f7ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,29,56,213,89,113,65,5,203,78,92,204,150,30,17,103,201,159,126,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
