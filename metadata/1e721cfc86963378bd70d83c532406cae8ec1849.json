Aubrey Bodine was an astonishing photographer. His photos of the Maryland, Virginia-Tidewater area are probably some of the best ever created. This book does an admirable job of presenting many of these photos. There is a nice cartoon type map of region's history and places of interest on the endpapers. He was the 1st photographer to take photos of the midshipmen brigade from a helicopter and that is included. All the photos are done in black and white - they show amazing detail. The men of the Bay country is just one of the examples of the subjects that are included. There are fascinating stories of how and what happened when he took the photos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e721cfc86963378bd70d83c532406cae8ec1849","amp;dn":"Arts+of+The+South+Seas+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e721cfc86963378bd70d83c532406cae8ec1849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,114,28,252,134,150,51,120,189,112,216,60,83,36,6,202,232,236,24,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
