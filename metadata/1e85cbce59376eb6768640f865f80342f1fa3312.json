During that time, a number of excellent musicians made their way through the band, but Country Gazette retained a distinctive progressive bluegrass style, as this compilation demonstrates. Certainly, anyone wanting an idea of what the group achieved during the height of their career should pick up Hello Operator, since it sums up their music succinctly and effectively. ~ Thom Owens\n\ntracklist:\n\n01#  Saro Jane\n02# Virginia Boys, The\n03# Love, Lost and Found\n04# Fidelio, Op. 72: Overture in e Major\n05# Sweet Allis Chalmers\n06# You Can't Get the Hell Out of Texas\n07# Charlotte Breakdown\n08# Great Joe Bob, a (A Regional Tragedy)\n09# Still Feeling Blue\n10# Uncle Clooney Played the Banjo (But Mostly Out of Time)\n11# Molly and Tenbrooks\n12# Kentucky Waltz\n13# Blue Light\n14# Tallahassee\n15# Highland Dream\n16# Last Thing On My Mind\n17# Hello Operator\n18# Great American Banjo Tune, The\n19# Nothing Is Left But the Blues\n20# Cabin On a Mountain\n21# Done Gone \n\nArrangers: Joe Carr; Alan Munde; Roland White.\n\nCountry Gazette: Alan Munde (banjo and guitar on all tracks), Roland White (mandolin, guitar and vocals on all tracks), Joe Carr (guitar, mandolin, vocals), Billy Joe Foster (electric bass, guitar, fiddle, vocals), Gene Wooten (dobro, guitar, vocals), Roger Bush (bass, vocals), Kenny Wertz (guitar, vocals), Bill Smith (bass, vocals), Michael Anderson (bass, vocals).\n\nGuest Artists: Sam Bush (fiddle), Kathy Chiavola (electric bass), David Grier (guitar), Al Perkins (steel guitar), Dave Ferguson (fiddle), Lawrence White (bluegrass brushes), Dahrell Norris (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e85cbce59376eb6768640f865f80342f1fa3312","amp;dn":"Country+Gazette+-+Hello+Operator%2C+This+Is+Country+Gazette","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e85cbce59376eb6768640f865f80342f1fa3312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,133,203,206,89,55,110,182,118,134,64,248,101,248,3,66,241,250,51,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
