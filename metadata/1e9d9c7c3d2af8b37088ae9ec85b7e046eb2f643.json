Drawing on dozens of \nexclusive interviews in Russia, where he worked as a Kremlin insider \nadvising Putin on press relations, Roxburgh also argues that the West threw \naway chances to bring Russia in from the cold by failing to understand its \nfears and aspirations following the collapse of communism.\n\nThe Strongman: Vladimir Putin and the Struggle for Russia\nBy: Angus Roxburgh\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nISBN: 9781780760162\nPages: 701","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9d9c7c3d2af8b37088ae9ec85b7e046eb2f643","amp;dn":"The+Strongman+Vladimir+Putin+and+the+Struggle+for+Russia+by+Angu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9d9c7c3d2af8b37088ae9ec85b7e046eb2f643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,157,156,124,61,42,248,179,112,136,174,158,200,91,126,4,110,178,246,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
