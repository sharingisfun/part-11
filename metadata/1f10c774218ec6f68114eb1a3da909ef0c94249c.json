Travelling to Russian battlefield locations, he charts how Russia was almost annihilated within a few months as Stalin lurched from crisis to crisis, coming close to a nervous breakdown.\n\nReynolds shows how Stalin learnt to compromise in order to win, listening to his generals and downplaying communist ideology to appeal instead to the Russian people's nationalist fighting spirit. He also squares up to the terrible moral dilemma at the heart of World War Two. Using original telegrams and official documents, he looks afresh at Winston Churchill's controversial visit to Moscow in 1942 and re-examines how Britain and America were drawn into alliance with Stalin, a dictator almost as murderous as the Nazi enemy.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011wh1g&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011wh1g&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 89mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.61 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid and SRT also available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f10c774218ec6f68114eb1a3da909ef0c94249c","amp;dn":"BBC+World+War+Two+1941+and+the+Man+of+Steel+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f10c774218ec6f68114eb1a3da909ef0c94249c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,16,199,116,33,142,198,246,129,20,235,26,61,169,9,239,12,148,36,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
