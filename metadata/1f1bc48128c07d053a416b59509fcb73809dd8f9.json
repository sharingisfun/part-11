Her children were grown; she had successfully overcome illness; her beloved parents were getting older. One day she notices a dark-skinned African man tending her neighborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yard. His name is Giles Owita. He bags groceries at the supermarket. He comes from Kenya. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very good at gardening.\n\nBefore long Giles is transforming not only CarolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yard, but her life. Though they are seemingly quite different, a caring bond grows between them. But they both hold long-buried secrets that, when revealed, will cement their friendship forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1bc48128c07d053a416b59509fcb73809dd8f9","amp;dn":"Mister+Owita%27s+Guide+to+Gardening+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1bc48128c07d053a416b59509fcb73809dd8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,27,196,129,40,192,125,5,58,65,107,89,80,159,203,115,128,157,216,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
