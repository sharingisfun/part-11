Don Peyote???s profound ambient music, combined with Hemi-Sync?? frequencies, provide you the space to be fully present where you are now. Free your consciousness from the illusion of time, and allow memories from the past and worries about the future to dissolve as you move into the presence of Being. Instruments include: chimes, analog synthesizers, guitar, Tibetan throat singing, and singing bowls. Length: 55 minutes.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3e50401fb8fd9a150e1903105df52597b6625c","amp;dn":"Monroe+Institute+++Eternal+Now+with+Hemi+Sync+Metamusic+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3e50401fb8fd9a150e1903105df52597b6625c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,62,80,64,31,184,253,154,21,14,25,3,16,93,245,37,151,182,98,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
