The series showed Smith's &quot;dark side&quot;, \nas it was much more mature than his previous works. The series originally ran \nwith 3 issues a year with repeated delays, but has now been changed to a \nbimonthly schedule. The series follows the art thief RASL, who jumps to \nparallel universes in attempts to steal parallel paintings, but soon runs \ninto dangerous scenarios as he is pursued by the government.\n\nRASL is written and drawn as a sci-fi noir. It draws influences from real life \nevents, people and places in addition to Southwestern Native American culture \nand hardboiled crime fiction. The art style is high contrast black and white \nand is notably more detailed and &quot;human&quot; than Smith's previous work, Bone. \nThe story follows a central story, but is narrated extensively through RASL's \nthoughts. Smith also utilizes flashbacks to tell the story of RASL's past.\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3fcc011ec67bd9d80a9c37893b21271e19ced5","amp;dn":"RASL+%28ongoing%29+%231+-+11++%5BJeff+Smith%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3fcc011ec67bd9d80a9c37893b21271e19ced5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,63,204,1,30,198,123,217,216,10,156,55,137,59,33,39,30,25,206,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
