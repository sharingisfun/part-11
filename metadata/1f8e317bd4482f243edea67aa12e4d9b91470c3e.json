However, Anne-Marie Duff later stated that the director and scriptwriter explicitly told her to play the queen as a life-long virgin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8e317bd4482f243edea67aa12e4d9b91470c3e","amp;dn":"The+Virgin+Queen+-+Part+4++%28BBC+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8e317bd4482f243edea67aa12e4d9b91470c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,142,49,123,212,72,47,36,62,222,166,122,161,46,77,155,145,71,12,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
