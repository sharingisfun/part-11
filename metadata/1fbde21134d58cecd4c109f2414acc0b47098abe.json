This book offers a radical reassessment of Constantine as an emperor, a pagan, and a Christian. The book examines in detail a wide variety of evidence, including literature, secular and religious architectural monuments, coins, sculpture, and other works of art. \n\nSetting the emperor in the context of the kings and emperors who preceded him, Jonathan Bardill shows how Constantine's propagandists exploited the traditional themes and imagery of rulership to portray him as having been elected by the supreme solar God to save his people and inaugurate a brilliant golden age. \nThe author argues that the cultivation of this image made it possible for Constantine to reconcile the long-standing tradition of imperial divinity with his monotheistic faith by assimilating himself to Christ.\n\n\nContents\nIllustrations\nAcknowledgements\nAbbreviations\nChronology\nMap of the Roman Empire under the Tetrarchs and Constantine\nThe Families of the Tetrarchs and Constantine\nIntroduction\n1\tA Change of Image\n2\tEmperors and Divine Protectors\n3\tThe Saving Ruler and the Logos-Nomos\n4\tThe Hippodrome Procession\n5\tThe Symbol from the Sun, the Standard, and the Sarcophagus\n6\tThe Roman Colossus\n7\tConstantine and Christianity\n8\tSol and Christianity\n9\tConstantine as Christ\nEpilogue\nBibliography\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbde21134d58cecd4c109f2414acc0b47098abe","amp;dn":"Constantine%2C+Divine+Emperor+of+the+Christian+Golden+Age+%28History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fbde21134d58cecd4c109f2414acc0b47098abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,189,226,17,52,213,140,236,212,193,9,242,65,74,204,11,71,9,138,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
