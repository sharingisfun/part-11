The heavy hitting (and flat-out heavy) M14 was developed and deployed but short-lived as a main battle rifle as its limitations were exposed in the conflict. It was replaced by the lightweight M16, a smaller-caliber .223 rifle described as a &quot;Mattel toy&quot; upon its initial deployment. It, too, was limited in battle, at first, lacking a chrome-lined barrel and chamber and cleaning instructions and equipment for operators. But with the introduction of the A1 model, the weapon began to prove its worth. Examined later in episode seven is the development of the A2 version and on through to today's M4 carbine. Also highlighted are the M60 machine gun, the M249 machine gun, the M79 &quot;thumper&quot; grenade launcher, and the M203 weapons-mounted grenade launcher. Of course, the piece also explores the origins and the proliferation of the AK-47. The program ends with a single shot of a Glock pistol, a weapon one would think would have garnered more attention in the film's final chapter as a quantum-leap forward in polymer and striker-fired handguns (with all due respect to the HK VP70).\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n2)  SD Version \n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1452 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 404\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 40.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: average 414 MB\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Source: BluRay DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2045c1ba7ec709b63deb16a4f49a5197d5754e9c","amp;dn":"Guns+The+Evolution+of+Firearms+7of7+Post+World+War+2+to+Today+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2045c1ba7ec709b63deb16a4f49a5197d5754e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,69,193,186,126,199,9,182,61,235,22,164,244,154,81,151,213,117,78,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
