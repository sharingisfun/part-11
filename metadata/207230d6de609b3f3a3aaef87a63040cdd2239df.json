While Buckingham only contributed three songs, he helped the band develop a coherent vision, providing crystal-clear backings for Nicks' hippie anthems and Christine McVie's remarkably improved pop-soul. McVie dominates the album, contributing some of her finest songs, including the sighing &quot;Over My Head&quot; and the bouncy &quot;Say You Love Me.&quot; Nicks' songs function as folky counterpoints to McVie's sweet pop, and she rarely ever wrote songs as memorably affecting as &quot;Rhiannon&quot; or &quot;Landslide.&quot; Remarkably, Fleetwood Mac is a blockbuster album that isn't dominated by its hit singles, and its album tracks (&quot;World Turning,&quot;&quot;Sugar Daddy,&quot; &quot;Crystal&quot;) demonstrate a depth of both songwriting and musicality that would blossom fully on Rumours. \n \n \n Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic, \n HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality \n of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is! \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Monday morning [02:48] \n 02.Warm ways [03:55] \n 03.Blue letter [02:41] \n 04.Rhiannon [04:11] \n 05.Over my head [03:38] \n 06.Crystal [05:14] \n 07.Say you love me [04:11] \n 08.Landslide [03:20] \n 09.World turning [04:26] \n 10.Sugar daddy [04:11] \n 11.I'm so afraid [04:23] \n ____ \n \n 42:58 min \n 61,7 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:207230d6de609b3f3a3aaef87a63040cdd2239df","amp;dn":"Fleetwood_Mac-Fleetwood_Mac-%28Retail%29-1975-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"207230d6de609b3f3a3aaef87a63040cdd2239df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,114,48,214,222,96,155,63,58,58,174,248,122,99,4,12,221,34,57,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
