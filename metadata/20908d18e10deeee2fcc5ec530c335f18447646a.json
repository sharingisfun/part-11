This is not one of his better efforts (so don't say I recommended it for entertainment value). It is interesting for historical reasons, comparing the two movies scene-by-scene. Also, we get a slice-of-life view of the black power movement of the 1960s.\n\nThis is also your chance to see Leon Bibb as Eddy Moxie. Famous as a folk-singer, he only acted in a few movies. He moved to Vancouver after making this one; he still performs occasionally.\n\nAnother youtube reseed in mp4 format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20908d18e10deeee2fcc5ec530c335f18447646a","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Man+%281969%29+Sidney+Poitier+Leon+Bibb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20908d18e10deeee2fcc5ec530c335f18447646a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,144,141,24,225,13,238,238,47,204,94,197,48,195,53,241,132,71,100,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
