Talk The Talk\n\nIt's been a while since listeners last heard from the HeadCat, Lemmy Kilmister's rock &amp; roll side project. And now, five years after the release of their debut, Fool's Paradise, comes their sophomore effort, Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk. Joining the Lem-man once more are Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom and Rockats guitarist Danny B. Harvey, and again, the trio has cooked up a rockin' good time, heavy on readings of classic rock &amp; rollers from yesteryear, cases in point being several tracks that were later covered/made famous by rock royalty -- the Chuck Berry obscurity &quot;Let It Rock&quot; (later covered by the Rolling Stones), Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates' &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; (later covered by the Who), and an album-closing rendition of Robert Johnson's &quot;Crossroads&quot; (later covered by Cream). And Lemmy's trademark throaty growl works better than you'd think in the context of old-time rock &amp; roll, as he takes it down a few notches on such ditties as &quot;I Ain't Never&quot; and &quot;The Eagle Flies on Friday.&quot; As with the HeadCat's debut album, Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk is a much welcomed arrival in a period that will undoubtedly go down as &quot;the Auto-Tune era,&quot; when the original thrill of raw and real rock &amp; roll has been all but replaced by computer-perfected blahness.
