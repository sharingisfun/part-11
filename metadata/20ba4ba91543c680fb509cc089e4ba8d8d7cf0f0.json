Set a couple of years after Robocop\ninitially went online, the show was toned down somewhat to meet the\nbroadcast television standards of the day, where the hallmark excessive\nviolence of the film franchise would be simply unacceptable. So, instead\nwe get Robocop thinking a little more and finding non-lethal ways of\napprehending the villains (while saving little kids half the time).\n\nIt&amp;#039;s cheesy fun!\n\nThe acting&amp;#039;s a bit iffy, it&amp;#039;s got some over-the-top villains (Pudface\nMorgan? Dr. Cray Z. Mallardo? and that&amp;#039;s just the pilot), it even looks\ncheap a lot of the time despite budgets of over ~$1 million per episode.\n\nIf all you ever cared about the Robocop franchise was for the action\nspectacle body-count, you&amp;#039;ll probably walk away from this one\ndisappointed (although a few nice explosions here and there are\nprobably what ate up all the budgets...), BUT, if you like a cheerily cheesy\ncorporate controlled pseudo-dystopian near future THIS SHOW&amp;#039;S FOR\nYOU!\n\nDVD rips, 576x432 @ 25fps, Xvid, sourced from the UK DVD release\n\n\nHere&amp;#039;s a more in-depth review: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://robocoparchive.com/misc/series-alookback.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://robocoparchive.com/misc/series-alookback.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContents of download:  Robocop The Series\n\n 01 The Future of Law Enforcement.avi (742.59 megabyte)\n 02 Prime Suspect.avi (371.38 megabyte)\n 03 Trouble in Delta City.avi (371.55 megabyte)\n 04 Officer Missing.avi (371.39 megabyte)\n 05 What Money Can&amp;#039;t Buy.avi (371.58 megabyte)\n 06 Ghosts of War.avi (371.39 megabyte)\n 07 Zone Five.avi (371.57 megabyte)\n 08 Provision 22.avi (371.4 megabyte)\n 09 Faces of Eve.avi (371.41 megabyte)\n 10 When Justice Fails.avi (371.42 megabyte)\n 11 The Human Factor.avi (371.42 megabyte)\n 12 Inside Crime.avi (371.55 megabyte)\n 13 Robocop vs Commander Cash.avi (371.39 megabyte)\n 14 Illusions.avi (371.57 megabyte)\n 15 Tin Man.avi (371.23 megabyte)\n 16 Sisters in Crime.avi (371.67 megabyte)\n 17 Heartbreakers.avi (370.51 megabyte)\n 18 Mothers Day.avi (370.66 megabyte)\n 19 Nano.avi (370.62 megabyte)\n 20 Corporate Raiders.avi (370.51 megabyte)\n 21 Midnight Minus One.avi (370.8 megabyte)\n 22 Public Enemies.avi (370.65 megabyte)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20ba4ba91543c680fb509cc089e4ba8d8d7cf0f0","amp;dn":"Robocop%3A+The+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20ba4ba91543c680fb509cc089e4ba8d8d7cf0f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,186,75,169,21,67,198,128,251,80,156,192,137,228,186,141,141,124,240,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
