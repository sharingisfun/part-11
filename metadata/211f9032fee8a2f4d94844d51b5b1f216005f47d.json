This trend has echoed around the world: from the Zapatistas to Chechen and Kurdish nationalists, social and political movements are framing their struggles in the languages of rights and recognition, and hence, of citizenship.\n\n\nCitizenship has thus become an increasingly important axis in the social sciences. Social scientists have been rethinking the role of political agent or subject. Not only are the rights and obligations of citizens being redefined, but also what it means to be a citizen has become an issue of central concern.\n\n\nAs the process of globalization produces multiple diasporas, we can expect increasingly complex relationships between homeland and host societies that will make the traditional idea of national citizenship problematic. As societies are forced to manage cultural difference and associated tensions and conflict, there will be changes in the processes by which states allocate citizenship and a differentiation of the category of citizen.\n\n\nThis book constitutes the most authoritative and comprehensive guide to the terrain. Drawing on a wealth of interdisciplinary knowledge, and including some of the leading commentators of the day, it is an essential guide to understanding modern citizenship.\n\nPrint Length: 340 pages\nPublisher: SAGE Publications Ltd; abridged edition edition (29 January 2003)\nSold by: Amazon Digital South Asia Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B002A9J8SE\n\n__\n\nAbout the editors:\n\nEngin F Isin is Associate Professor of Social Science at York University.
