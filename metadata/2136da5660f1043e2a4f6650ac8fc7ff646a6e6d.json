The Shadow of the Winter Palace recounts an extraordinary century of Russian history, a politically tempestuous time that was also a Golden Age of intellectual and artistic achievementÃ¢â‚¬â€the century of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, of Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky. A master stylist and a distinguished historian, Edward Crankshaw limns portraits of the czars, the revolutionaries, and a host of other charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€and provides a riveting history packed with information about the past and implications for the present.
