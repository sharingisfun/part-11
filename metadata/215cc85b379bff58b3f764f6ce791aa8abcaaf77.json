He published articles and lectured on the occult and the cults which were spearheads for the current New Age Movement. The impending threat to the Christian Church has now become a reality. Today almost 60 million people dabble in some practices or forms of New Age and occultic thinking.\n\nThe New Age Cult is Dr. Martin's militant refutation of what has become a major controversy in Christendom. He defines and answers biblically the key teachings of the New Age, exposes the latent dangers of the movement, gives criteria for identifying New Age groups and leaders, and shows the effective steps for communication Christian truth to New Age adherents.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Walter Martin was fondly and respectfully known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the father of Christian cult apologetics.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Many current professional and academic cult apologists credit him with their introduction to the field. He held four earned degrees, having received his Doctorate from California Coast University in the field of Comparative Religions. Author of a dozen books, a half-dozen booklets, and many articles, he was known nationwide as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bible Answer Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ host of one of the oldest and most popular nationally syndicated call-in radio programs. He was founder and director of the Christian Research Institute, located in Southern California, which continues to provide cult apologetics information and to sponsor the ever-popular Bible Answer Man daily broadcast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215cc85b379bff58b3f764f6ce791aa8abcaaf77","amp;dn":"The+New+Age+Cult+-+Dr+Walter+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215cc85b379bff58b3f764f6ce791aa8abcaaf77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,92,200,91,55,155,255,88,179,247,100,246,206,121,26,168,171,202,175,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
