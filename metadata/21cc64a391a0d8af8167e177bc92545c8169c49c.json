You will be asked where you want to place the extracted files. This is a temporary folder only - you can delete these files once the Direct X 9.0c installation has completed. Now go to that temporary folder. There will be lots of files in there - run DXSETUP.exe and wait for it to complete the installation. Restart you computer if required. Now you can delete the files in the temporary folder. For future use, you can keep the file you downloaded or simply delete it - it doesn&amp;#039;t matter.\n\n# DirectX is a crucial system component. It cannot be uninstalled without reinstalling your operating system (!) or performing a system restore/system recovery.\n\n# To determine what version is current installed on your system and other tips about DirectX, see our guide here.\n\n# This version of DirectX was released November 2007.\n\n\nTHIS IS AS MUCH A MESSAGE AS OF DOWNLOAD. -there are many places to grab this.\n\ngreeeeetz.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21cc64a391a0d8af8167e177bc92545c8169c49c","amp;dn":"DirectX+9+%5BNOV.2007%5D+MUST+HAVE+TO+GAME+%5Bdopeman%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21cc64a391a0d8af8167e177bc92545c8169c49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,204,100,163,145,160,216,175,129,103,225,119,188,146,84,92,129,105,196,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
