It was Zhukov who saved Leningrad from capture by the Wehrmacht in September 1941, Zhukov who led the defense of Moscow in October 1941, Zhukov who spearheaded the Red ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s march on Berlin and formally accepted GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconditional surrender in the spring of 1945. Drawing on the latest research from recently opened Soviet archives, including the uncensored versions of ZhukovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own memoirs, Roberts offers a vivid portrait of a man whose tactical brilliance was matched only by the cold-blooded ruthlessness with which he pursued his battlefield objectives.\n\n After the war, Zhukov was a key player on the geopolitical scene. As KhrushchevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense minister, he was one of the architects of Soviet military strategy during the Cold War. While lauded in the West as a folk heroÃ¢â‚¬â€he was the only Soviet general ever to appear on the cover of Time magazineÃ¢â‚¬â€Zhukov repeatedly ran afoul of the Communist political authorities. Wrongfully accused of disloyalty, he was twice banished and erased from his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official historyÃ¢â‚¬â€left out of books and paintings depicting Soviet World War II victories. Piercing the hyperbole of the Zhukov personality cult, Roberts debunks many of the myths that have sprung up around ZhukovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and career to deliver fresh insights into the marshalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationships with Stalin, Khrushchev, and Eisenhower.\n\n A remarkably intimate portrait of a man whose life was lived behind an Iron Curtain of official secrecy, StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s General is an authoritative biography that restores Zhukov to his rightful place in the twentieth-century military pantheon.\n\nAmazon.co.uk title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Stalins-General-Life-Georgy-Zhukov/dp/1848314426&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Stalins-General-Life-Georgy-Zhukov/dp/1848314426&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f0e90bdcd28fe44376e54a5bda8e13509e2ae1","amp;dn":"Stalin%27s+General%3A+The+Life+of+Georgy+Zhukov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f0e90bdcd28fe44376e54a5bda8e13509e2ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,240,233,11,220,210,143,228,67,118,229,74,91,218,142,19,80,158,42,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
