This makes you want to put on spangled shoes and be a rock star. It is a huge, riotous, spooky, ambient, moody, loud CD. It has the size of great glam-era Bowie but the maudlin smarts of the Smiths. Highly recommended for dancing on tables, drinking vodka, and finding a too-young-for-you partner. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 62\nArtist: Pulp\nAlbum: Different Class\nYear: 1995\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2200889bcf3fa0489f39604c2c63b3398c81b411","amp;dn":"Pulp+-+Different+Class+%5BFLAC-1995%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2200889bcf3fa0489f39604c2c63b3398c81b411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,0,136,155,207,63,160,72,159,57,96,76,44,99,179,57,140,129,180,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
