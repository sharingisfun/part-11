Martin Isaacs\nAmerican Mathematical Society | January 2009 | ISBN-10: 0821847996 | DJVU/PDF | 516 pages | 8.3/15.8 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics-Martin/dp/0821847996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics-Martin/dp/0821847996&lt;/a&gt;\nPDF conversion is mine.\n\nThis book, based on a first-year graduate course the author taught at the University of Wisconsin, contains more than enough material for a two-semester graduate-level abstract algebra course, including groups, rings and modules, fields and Galois theory, an introduction to algebraic number theory, and the rudiments of algebraic geometry. In addition, there are some more specialized topics not usually covered in such a course. These include transfer and character theory of finite groups, modules over artinian rings, modules over Dedekind domains, and transcendental field extensions. This book could be used for self study as well as for a course text, and so full details of almost all proofs are included, with nothing being relegated to the chapter-end problems. There are, however, hundreds of problems, many being far from trivial. The book attempts to capture some of the informality of the classroom, as well as the excitement the author felt when taking the corresponding course as a student.\n\nContents\nPART ONE Noncommutative Algebra 1\nCHAPTER 1 Definitions and Examples o[Groups 3\nCHAPTER 2 Subgroups and Cosets 14\nCHAPTER 3 Homomorphisms 30\nCHAPTER 4 Group Actions 42\nCHAPTER 5 The Sylow Theorems and p-groups 55\nCHAPTER 6 Permutation Groups 70\nCHAPTER 7 New Groups from Old 83\nCHAPTER 8 Solvable and Nilpotent Groups 99\nCHAPTER 9 Transfer lJ 5\nCHAPTER 10 Operator Groups and Unique Decompositions 129\nCHAPTER I I Module Theory without Rings 142\nCHAPTER 12 Rings, Ideals, and Modules 159\nCHAPTER 13 Simple Modules and Primitive Rings 177\nCHAPTER 14 Artinian Rings and Projective Modules 194\nCHAPTER 15 An Introduction to Character Theory 213\n\nPART TWO Commutative Algebra 231\nCHAPTER 16 Polynomial Rings, P/Ds, and UFDs 233\nCHAPTER 17 Field Extensions 254\nCHAPTER 18 Galois Theory 274\nCHAPTER 19 Separability and Inseparability 293\nCHAPTER 20 Cyclotomy and Geometric Constructions 307\nCHAPTER 21 Finite Fields 326\nCHAPTER 22 Roots, Radicals, and Real Numbers 342\nCHAPTER 23 Norms, Traces, and Discriminants 359\nCHAPTER 24 Transcendental Extensions 379\nCHAPTER 25 The Artin-Schreier Theorem 401\nCHAPTER 26 Ideal Theory 418\nCHAPTER 27 Noetherian Rings 433\nCHAPTER 28 Integrality 453\nCHAPTER 29 Dedekind Domains 474\nCHAPTER 30 Algebraic Sets and the Nullstellensatz 493\nIndex 507","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229103e7702d1d9acc09361cf5726ec267fc45ef","amp;dn":"Algebra+-+A+Graduate+Course+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229103e7702d1d9acc09361cf5726ec267fc45ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,145,3,231,112,45,29,154,204,9,54,28,245,114,110,194,103,252,69,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
