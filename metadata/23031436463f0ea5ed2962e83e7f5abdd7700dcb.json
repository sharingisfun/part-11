Released in 1971, Aqualung, despite the band's disagreement, is regarded as a concept album featuring a \r\n\r\ncentral theme of &quot;the distinction between religion and God&quot;.[1] The album's &quot;dour musings on faith and religion&quot; have marked it as &quot;one of the most cerebral albums ever to \r\n\r\nreach millions of rock listeners&quot;.[2] Aqualung's success marked a turning point in the band's career, who went on to become a major radio and touring act.\r\n\r\nRecorded at Island Records' studio in London, it was their first album with John Evan as a full-time member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond and last album \r\n\r\nfeaturing Clive Bunker on drums. Something of a departure from the band's previous work, the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; andâ€”inspired by \r\n\r\nphotographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennieâ€”contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with \r\n\r\nAnderson's own personal experiences.\r\n\r\nAqualung has sold more than seven million units worldwide according to Anderson, and is thus Jethro Tull's best selling album. The album was generally well-received \r\n\r\ncritically, and has been included on several music magazine &quot;best of&quot; lists. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST (1971 ORIGINAL RELASE):\r\n\r\n\r\nSide one â€“ Aqualung\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Aqualung&quot; (Ian Anderson, Jennie Anderson) 6:34 \r\n2. &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;   4:06 \r\n3. &quot;Cheap Day Return&quot;   1:21 \r\n4. &quot;Mother Goose&quot;   3:51 \r\n5. &quot;Wond'ring Aloud&quot;   1:53 \r\n6. &quot;Up to Me&quot;   3:15 \r\n\r\n\r\nSide two â€“ My God\r\n\r\n1. &quot;My God&quot;   7:08 \r\n2. &quot;Hymn 43&quot;   3:14 \r\n3. &quot;Slipstream&quot;   1:13 \r\n4. &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;   4:23 \r\n5. &quot;Wind-Up&quot;   6:01 \r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL TIME 43:20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJethro Tull:\r\n\r\nIan Anderson â€“ vocals, acoustic guitar, flute, producer\r\nClive Bunker â€“ drums and percussion\r\nMartin Barre â€“ electric guitar, descant recorder\r\nJohn Evan â€“ piano, organ, mellotron\r\nJeffrey Hammond (as &quot;Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond&quot;) â€“ bass guitar, alto recorder and odd voices (and backing vocals on &quot;Mother Goose&quot;)\r\nGlenn Cornick â€“ bass guitar (played with the band at rehearsals for the album in June 1970, some of which may also have been recording sessions â€“ especially in the early \r\n\r\nversions of &quot;My God&quot; and &quot;Wondring Again/Wondring Aloud&quot; â€“ although he is not credited on the album)[6]\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel:\r\n\r\nJohn Burns â€“ recording engineer\r\nDavid Palmer â€“ orchestral arrangements and conduction\r\nBurton Silverman â€“ album artwork\r\nTerry Ellis - executive producer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWAKE UP!\r\n\r\n\r\n10:52 AM 8/22/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23031436463f0ea5ed2962e83e7f5abdd7700dcb","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+Aqualung+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23031436463f0ea5ed2962e83e7f5abdd7700dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,3,20,54,70,63,14,165,237,41,98,232,62,127,90,189,215,112,13,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
