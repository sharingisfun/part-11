Based on Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel.\n\n\n\nIn the 11th millennium, Shaddam IV, ruler of the Galactic Empire, rids himself of his competitor Duke Leto Atreides by giving him control of the desert planet Dune also called Arrakis; fully aware that its present owner, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, will not give it up without a fight. The reason is that Arrakis is the source of the valuable spice, a substance produced by enormous and dangerous sandworms, which bestows special mental qualities on anyone who consumes it. A short while later Harkonnen does indeed succeed in ambushing and massacring Leto and his men. Leto's mistress Lady Jessica, who is a member of the clairvoyant order of Bene Gesserit, manages to escape into the desert with her son Paul, and after a long and dangerous march they finally encounter the Fremen, the long suppressed desert tribe of Arrakis. Impressed by Paul's clairvoyant abilities, tribal prince Stilgar takes in the fugitives. Very soon the Fremen are convinced that Paul is their long-prophesied redeemer\n\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\n****-Note About DvD-**** \n\nNothing has been added nor taken away it is as I received it. If there are no subs in your required language it is because there were none on the DvD and I was unable to procure a DvD with those Subs.\n\n\n\nIngenting har lagts till eller tagits bort ÃƒÂ¤r det som jag fick den. Om det inte finns nÃƒÂ¥gra subs i ditt ÃƒÂ¶nskat sprÃƒÂ¥k ÃƒÂ¤r det fÃƒÂ¶r att det fanns ingen pÃƒÂ¥ DVD och jag kunde inte skaffa en DVD med dessa Subs\n\n\n\nNiets is toegevoegd of weggenomen is als ik hem ontving. Als er geen subs in uw gewenste taal is het omdat er geen waren op de DVD en ik was niet in staat om een Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹DVD te kopen met die Subs.\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance go to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nOther Downloads you may Like\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2338f4b21b99d7bb39c6e0f8855d35852978a3e7","amp;dn":"Dune+-+The+Mini+Series+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2338f4b21b99d7bb39c6e0f8855d35852978a3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,56,244,178,27,153,215,187,57,198,224,248,133,93,53,133,41,120,163,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
