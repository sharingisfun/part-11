Their tradition of International Night has afforded Mark an opportunity to share with his daughter, Talia--and now the readers of International Night--the recipes, stories, and insights he's collected over more than thirty years of traveling the world writing about food, culture, and history, and his charming pen-and-ink drawings, which appear throughout the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237a288d0def06f661f05f63306b15dffeeb7637","amp;dn":"International+Night%3A+A+Father+and+Daughter+Cook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237a288d0def06f661f05f63306b15dffeeb7637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,122,40,141,13,239,6,246,97,240,95,99,48,107,21,223,254,235,118,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
