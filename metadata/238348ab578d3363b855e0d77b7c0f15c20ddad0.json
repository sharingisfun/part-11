Groups are better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.\n\nThis seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate, how knowledge is advanced, how economies are (or should be) organized and how we live our daily lives. With seemingly boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose, Surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture, psychology, economic behaviorism, artificial intelligence, military history, and political theory to show just how this principle operates in the real world.\n\nDespite the sophistication of his arguments, Surowiecki presents them in a wonderfully entertaining manner. The examples he uses are all down-to-earth, surprising, and fun to ponder. Why is the line in which you're standing always the longest? Why is it that you can buy a screw anywhere in the world and it will fit a bolt bought ten-thousand miles away? Why is network television so awful? If you had to meet someone in Paris on a specific day but had no way of contacting them, when and where would you meet? Why are there traffic jams? What's the best way to win money on a game show? Why, when you walk into a convenience store at 2:00 A.M. to buy a quart of orange juice, is it there waiting for you? What do Hollywood mafia movies have to teach us about why corporations exist?\n\nThe Wisdom of Crowds is a brilliant but accessible biography of an idea, one with important lessons for how we live our lives, select our leaders, conduct our business, and think about our world. \n\n\n\n\nPLEASE CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY AND SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD\n\nThanks!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238348ab578d3363b855e0d77b7c0f15c20ddad0","amp;dn":"The+Wisdom+of+Crowds+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238348ab578d3363b855e0d77b7c0f15c20ddad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,131,72,171,87,141,51,99,184,85,224,215,123,124,15,21,194,13,218,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
