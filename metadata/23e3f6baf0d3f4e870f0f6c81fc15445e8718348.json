She spent most of the 1980s playing her music in bars and busking. Her breakthrough came with her critically acclaimed 1993 debut album Time for Mercy and her first single &quot;I Would Die For You&quot;. Her success grew with 1994's Living Under June, which featured her biggest hit to date outside of Canada, &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which was released as a single from the soundtrack to the Christian Slater film Bed of Roses (number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100). Another single from that same album, &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot;, has also had significant, and consistent airplay on Canadian adult contemporary radio since its release, and in an unusual move for a Jann Arden song, even featured a dance remix version which circulated on pop radio at the time.[1]\n\nSubsequent albums include 1997's Happy?, 2000's Blood Red Cherry (on which Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo sang backing vocals), and 2003's Love Is the Only Soldier. She also released a greatest hits album, Greatest Hurts, in 2001, and a live album, Jann Arden Live with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (2002). In 2005, she released her eighth album (her sixth album of new material) titled simply Jann Arden.\n\nShe also covered Leonard Cohen's &quot;If it be your will...&quot; on the 1995 Cohen tribute album Tower of Song. The song also appears on Greatest Hurts and was a B-side to the &quot;Good Mother&quot; single.\n\nAlthough Arden's pop-rock songs are known for their sadness and tales of heartache, Arden is paradoxically also known for her gregarious sense of humour. Her personal stories, often involving her close-knit family, have won her great affection among her loyal fan base, and her concerts routinely sell out across Canada. In 1998, respondents to Chart magazine's year-end reader's poll named Arden the Canadian celebrity most deserving of her own talk show. Arden frequently does loving, homespun impersonations of her parents during her shows. As part of her public honesty about her family life, she has revealed that one of her brothers is serving a life sentence in prison, and that her song &quot;Hangin' by a Thread&quot; is dedicated to him.\n\nIn December 2006, the first images of a slimmed-down Arden appeared in a photo shoot for Chatelaine magazine, and she revealed that she has recently lost over 50 pounds.\n\nJann Arden released her ninth album, Uncover Me, on February 6, 2007. This album was her first comprising cover songs exclusively, except for one original piece, &quot;Counterfeit Heart&quot;. This was followed by her Uncover Me Tour across Canada during the spring of 2007.[2]\n\nOn the weekend of March 24, 2007, Jann Arden was admitted to intensive care for heart related concerns, diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with acute stress and exhaustion.\n\nShe had a 2007 USA Summer tour with Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. In 2010, they also carried the Olympic torch.[3]\n\nIn 2008, she co-produced the Nashville based Country Crossover group SHeDAISY's latest Album. In September 2009, Arden released her tenth album, Free, and its first single A Million Miles Away, in June.. She is also doing a cross-country Canadian tour, which began in November 2009. She toured with proceeds going to the &quot;Raise-a-Reader Concert Series&quot;.[4]\n\nIn November 2010, Arden will release her first ever live CD/DVD set, entitled Spotlight. The album will feature eight live tracks, a new single (&quot;I Can't Make You Stay&quot;) and a DVD featuring a documentary and Arden's complete music video catalogue.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe has made a number of charity appearances, including appearances in Africa for World Vision, performing at Live 8 and the MAC Cosmetics Fashion Cares AIDS benefits.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe appeared in the opening segment of an episode from the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot; starring Ellen DeGeneres, originally aired on January 8, 1997.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn 1998, she appeared in a comedic skit with host Jason Priestley to kick off the Juno Award ceremonies held in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn 2002, she appeared as The Ghost of Christmas Specials Past in The True Meaning of Christmas Specials\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe also appeared in the 2005 Corner Gas episode &quot;Fun Run&quot; and often makes guest appearances on the Rick Mercer Report.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe has taken part in performances of The Vagina Monologues across Canada.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe toured with Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© on the U.S. and European legs of his 2005 tour, and again toured with him on his 2007 U.S. tour.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShe sang &quot;O Canada&quot; at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAt the 2006 Juno Awards, to counter host Pamela Anderson's on-stage anti-seal hunting rant, Arden generated cheers when she jokingly told the audience that her bra was &quot;made entirely of seal eyelids&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Of 2010\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCould I Be Your Girl\t\nInsensitive\t\nLove Is The Only Soldier\nLiving Under June\nSaved\nGood Mother\nI Would Die For You\nSleepless\nUnloved\nWaiting For Someone\nI Just Don't Love You Anymore\nHanging By A Thread\nHow Good Things Are\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e3f6baf0d3f4e870f0f6c81fc15445e8718348","amp;dn":"Jann+Arden+-+Best+Of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e3f6baf0d3f4e870f0f6c81fc15445e8718348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,227,246,186,240,211,244,232,112,240,246,200,31,193,84,69,232,113,131,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
