Relying on a laid-back groove for most the album, the group just rolls along. Shack Man is the kind of album that will appeal most to soul-jazz beginners; for aficionados, the lack of grit in the groove makes it rather tedious. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n\nReleased in 1996, Shack-man may be the quintessential MMW disc. From the opening cover of the traditional spiritual &quot;Is There Anyone Here that Love My Jesus&quot; to the mellow swirls of the closing &quot;Kenny,&quot; the emphasis is on the almighty groove; though John Medeski (here pumping everything from Hammond B-3s to toy pianos) and bassist Chris Wood are much flashier players, it's drummer Billy Martin who really gets (and keeps) the party going. The laid-back, sunshine-and-palm-trees vibe of Hawaii (where Shack-man was recorded) creeps into some of the tracks, but the overall feel is more New Orleans than Waikiki.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
