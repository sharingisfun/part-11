The album is Lewis' first under RCA Records after parent company Sony Music Entertainment closed J Records and relocated its artists. Glassheart was conceived in 2010 shortly after the completion of Lewis' first headline tour, The Labyrinth. Recording and production took place in Denver, Los Angeles and London; originally the album was due for release in November 2011 but was pushed back several times to accommodate new recording sessions and allow more creative time. On Glassheart, Lewis reunites with Ryan Tedder, record producer of her previous singles &quot;Bleeding Love&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot; and songwriter Andrea Martin who co-wrote &quot;Better in Time,&quot; in addition to a number of new collaborators such as British duo Naughty Boy and Emeli SandÃƒÂ©, Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins and DJ Frank E. Producer Fraser T Smith executive produced the album after impressing Lewis with his work on Hurt: The EP (2011), a cover song extended play (EP) that Lewis released to bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart. &quot;Collide&quot;, a collaboration with house music DJ Avicii, was released on 2 September 2011. Originally a song by just Lewis, Avicii sued Sony Music claiming that the song plagarised his own instrumental &quot;Penguin&quot;. Through mutual agreement it was released as a collaboration, becoming a top-five hit in the UK and Lewis' first to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The Afrojack remix of &quot;Collide&quot; is the only version to feature on Glassheart. Subsequent singles &quot;Trouble&quot; featuring American rapper Childish Gambino and &quot;Lovebird&quot; were less successful, the former reaching top-ten in the UK and top-thirty in Ireland while the latter sold fewer than 600 copies in the UK and failed to chart anywhere in Europe. Glassheart received a mixed reception from critics who praised the vocals and experimental use of dubstep and electronic music but were less impressed with the album's many ballads. In the UK, the album was Lewis' first album not to reach number one, debuting at number three with 27,000 copies in its first week. Elsewhere the album became Lewis' third top-five album in Ireland, and upon its international release in November 2012, reached top-thirty in some of continental Europe. Following a 2013 release for Austria and Germany, Glassheart peaked at number five and six respectively outperforming previous album Echo. In April 2013, Lewis embarked on the Glassheart Tour, in support of the album, visiting Switzerland, Germany and the UK..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Trouble\n[02] Un Love Me\n[03] Lovebird\n[04] Come Alive\n[05] Fireflies\n[06] I To You\n[07] Shake You Up\n[08] Stop The Clocks\n[09] Favourite Scar\n[10] When It Hurts\n[11] Glassheart\n[12] Fingerprint\n[13] Trouble - - - Leona Lewis Featuring Childish Gambino\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:48m:59s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 123mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
