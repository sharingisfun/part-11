His work spans six decades, and he has worked with luminaries from Grace Kelly to the Beach Boys and the Byrds, and recently, Loudon Wainwright III and Joanna Newsom. From child actor to film composer, producer, and ethnomusicologist, Parks has created a distinct musical legacy and influence through his own albums, and through his work for other artists and behind the scenes in the music industry.\n\nDiscover America is a 1972 album featuring Parks' take on Calypso music (notably through the inclusion of performers The Esso Trinidad &quot;Tripoli&quot; Steelband). Lyrical themes run a wide range of American History, from John Jones, to early 20th century musicians Bing Crosby and The Mills Brothers, actor Jack Palance, and political figures Franklin Roosevelt and J. Edgar Hoover.\n\n\nTrack listing:\n&quot;Jack Palance&quot; (Mighty Sparrow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59 \n&quot;Introduction&quot; (Samuel Alter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:27 \n&quot;Bing Crosby&quot; (The Lion) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21 \n&quot;Steelband Music&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11 \n&quot;The Four Mills Brothers&quot; (The Lion) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:28 \n&quot;Be Careful&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48 \n&quot;John Jones&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08 \n&quot;FDR in Trinidad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27 \n&quot;Sweet Trinidad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:56 \n&quot;Occapella&quot; (Allen Toussaint) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41 \n&quot;Sailin' Shoes&quot; (Lowell George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09 \n&quot;Riverboat&quot; (Allen Toussaint) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \n&quot;Ode to Tobago&quot; (Lord Kitchener; arranged &amp; adapted Van Dyke Parks) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13 \n&quot;Your Own Comes First&quot; (Lord Kitchener; arranged &amp; adapted Van Dyke Parks) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \n&quot;G-Man Hoover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55 \n&quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (John Philip Sousa) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:00 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:242ca91f1ba0a3905d5a072913446b2c7853318b","amp;dn":"Van+Dyke+Parks+-+Discover+America++1972++%28mp3%40320Kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"242ca91f1ba0a3905d5a072913446b2c7853318b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,44,169,31,27,160,163,144,93,90,7,41,19,68,107,44,120,83,49,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
