History has identified the period \nfollowing the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a \nterrible time when civilisation stopped. \n\nWaldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark \nAges were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions \nprovoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across \nEurope, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and \ndiscovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually \nan 'Age of Light'. \n\nIn the first episode he looks at how Christianity emerged into the Roman Empire \nas an artistic force in the third and fourth centuries. But with no description \nof Jesus in the Bible, how were Christians to represent their God? Waldemar \nexplores how Christian artists drew on images of ancient gods for inspiration \nand developed new forms of architecture to contain their art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2447f7cf07618698bdb88b93b49ab9d7213eda0c","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Dark+Ages%2C+An+Age+Of+Light+1+of+4+The+Clash+Of+The+Gods+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2447f7cf07618698bdb88b93b49ab9d7213eda0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,71,247,207,7,97,134,152,189,184,139,147,180,154,185,215,33,62,218,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
