Initially named The Drag Set, they released a little-known single in February 1967: &quot;Day and Night&quot; / &quot;Get Out of My Way&quot;.\n\nShortly after, they changed their name to The Open Mind, and in July 1969 released a self-titled LP which has since become highly sought by collectors.  This band produced one of the finest UK psychedelic albums.  The music is characterised by strong psychedelic guitar work, and powerful vocals and drumwork.\n\nThis reissue includes the band's second rare 45 release (August 1969), for which the band is best known, and which - unlike the first - wasn't taken from the album. It is superb: &quot;Magic Potion&quot; is a blistering 45 with great psychedelic fuzz guitar work.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Dear Louise\n02 Try Another Day\n03 I Feel the Same Way Too\n04 My Mind Cries\n05 Can't You See\n06 Thor the Thunder God\n07 Magic Potion (bonus) (second single, A-side, not on original LP)\n08 Horses and Chariots (first single A-side)\n09 Before My Time (first single B-side)\n10 Free as the Breeze\n11 Girl I'm So Alone\n12 Soul and My Will\n13 Falling Again\n14 Cast A Spell (bonus) (second single, B-side, not on original LP)\n\nThe Open Mind:\nMike Brancaccio: Guitar/Vocals\nTimothy De Feu: Bass\nPhil Fox: Drums\nTerry Martin: Guitar/Vocals\n\n(*Jon Anderson, who went on to form Yes, briefly sang in the band but left before the recordings.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2489b76b3a15cd82b2eb879f7fa14e82045fe93a","amp;dn":"The+Open+Mind+-+The+Open+Mind+%281969%29+%281993+reissue%29+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2489b76b3a15cd82b2eb879f7fa14e82045fe93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,137,183,107,58,21,205,130,178,235,135,159,127,161,78,130,4,95,233,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
