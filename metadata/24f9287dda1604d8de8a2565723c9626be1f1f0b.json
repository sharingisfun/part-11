Much more than a mere time line, the focus shifts from artist to movement to medium with fluidity. Gallery pages examine how particular subjects are depicted in art from a variety of cultures and time periods. Hundreds of color reproductions are sure to hold readers' interest as they discover the interconnectedness of thousands of years of artistic expression. The vast amount of information presented is neither overwhelming nor superficial, due to effective design and organization. Offering more than can be absorbed in one sitting, this appealing, oversize volume will have readers poring over it again and again.\nThis engaging guide takes children on an international tour of the world's greatest art, from the first daubs of paint in prehistoric caves to today's performance art. It includes all of the important art movements, from Renaissance to Rococo, as well as the great painters from all these eras. However, the approach is to look at art as an international exchange of ideas, not a straight history of western art. The book includes art from all countries, from aboriginal art to totem poles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f9287dda1604d8de8a2565723c9626be1f1f0b","amp;dn":"Children%27s+Book+of+Art+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f9287dda1604d8de8a2565723c9626be1f1f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,249,40,125,218,22,4,216,222,138,37,101,114,60,150,38,190,31,31,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
