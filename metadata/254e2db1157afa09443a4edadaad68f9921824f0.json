They began as an instrumental act playing harmonicas and called The Harmonichords or Harmony Chords in 1958, but turned to singing after a tour of England in 1959. They signed to Decca Records in the U.K. and changed their name in 1962, then scored their first hit, &quot;Charmaine&quot; (#6, 1963). Their biggest hit was &quot;Diane&quot; which went to number one in England and number ten in America in 1964; they continued to chart with new records through 1967 and maintained the original group on the cabaret circuit until a messy split between Stokes and the Cluskys in 1984.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gpfrxqr5ldhe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gpfrxqr5ldhe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere is no review at All Music, just an entry: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gpfyxqu0ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gpfyxqu0ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are some reviews here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000258GF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000258GF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
