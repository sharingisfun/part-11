A session musician and producer, Gates met in 1968 guitarist/vocalist James Griffin, who had already released a solo album called Summer Holiday. Griffin hired Gates to produce a new album, and the pair soon became a group, adding guitarist/vocalist Robb Royer from the band Pleasure Fair, who Gates had produced early in its career. The trio soon signed with Elektra Records, becoming one of the label's first pop bands. Naming themselves Bread, the group released its self-titled debut album in late 1968. Although it was filled with accessible, melodic soft rock that became the band's signature sound, the record had no hit singles.\n\nWith their second album, On the Waters, Bread established themselves as hitmakers. &quot;Make It With You,&quot; the first single released from the album, became a number one hit, which led to &quot;It Don't Matter to Me,&quot; a song taken from Bread, becoming a Top Ten hit. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifyxqw5ldde~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifyxqw5ldde~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nOriginally released in the UK in 1977 as the Sound of Bread and as Anthology in the United States, this is a solid collection for these soft rock giants of the early '70s. Contained within are all of their hits, plus some delectable gems unknown to those familiar with Bread only from the radio. This set begins with &quot;Make It With You,&quot; which hit the number one spot in 1970, and ends with the group's last Top Ten hit, &quot;Lost Without Your Love&quot; from their reunion album of 1977. Other Top Ten hits include &quot;If,&quot; &quot;Baby I'm-a Want You,&quot; &quot;Everything I Own,&quot; &quot;It Don't Matter to Me,&quot; and &quot;Guitar Man,&quot; which reached number 11. The popular songs have held up well, but perhaps the most interesting cuts here are the lesser-known ones, like &quot;Dismal Day,&quot; &quot;Down on My Knees,&quot; and &quot;The Last Time.&quot; David Gates and company had quite a run, and this anthology shows why.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifqxqq5ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifqxqq5ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
