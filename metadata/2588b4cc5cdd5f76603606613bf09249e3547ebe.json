Unfortunately, she's summarily expelled on her 27th birthday(she's now too old). In desperation she takes a job as house mother for a sorority of misfits losing their house for lack of members. They have but a few months to find 30 pledges, or a sorority of mean girls will take over their place. Shelley figures that girls will pledge a house that boys find interesting, so she sets out to make the Zetas alluring, not act too smart, and host great parties. Can she succeed, and what about her own makeover? Sabotage is everywhere, plus it's hard to be one's self.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2588b4cc5cdd5f76603606613bf09249e3547ebe","amp;dn":"The.House.Bunny.2008.BluRay.720p.H264%5BBest.of.2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2588b4cc5cdd5f76603606613bf09249e3547ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,136,180,204,92,221,95,118,96,54,6,97,59,240,146,73,227,84,126,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
