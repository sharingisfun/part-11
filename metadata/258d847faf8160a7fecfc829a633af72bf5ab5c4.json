It has many built-in functional programming features, but most are complex and little understood. With the shift to functional programming increasing at a rapid pace, you need to know how to leverage your existing skills to take advantage of this trend.\nFunctional Programming in C# leads you along a path that begins with the historic value of functional ideas. Inside, C# MVP and functional programming expert Oliver Sturm explains the details of relevant language features in C# and describes theory and practice of using functional techniques in C#, including currying, partial application, composition, memoization, and monads. Next, he provides practical and versatile examples, which combine approaches to solve problems in several different areas, including complex scenarios like concurrency and high-performance calculation frameworks as well as simpler use cases like Web Services and business logic implementation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258d847faf8160a7fecfc829a633af72bf5ab5c4","amp;dn":"Programming+in+C%23+Programming+Techniques+for+Modern+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258d847faf8160a7fecfc829a633af72bf5ab5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,141,132,127,175,129,96,167,254,207,200,41,166,51,175,114,191,90,181,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
