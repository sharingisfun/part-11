To my knowledge, no other text leads students to question critically the assertions of Buddhist philosophers and to evaluate the arguments for them. Moreover, existing books often include only a few short selections from original Buddhist texts. This volume provides students with the opportunity to wrestle with the richness and complexity of the primary sources. Mark Siderits [is] one of the most important scholars of Buddhism in the world. No living author has done more to make Buddhist ideas intelligible and relevant to contemporary debates in analytic philosophy.&quot;\n--Charles Goodman, Binghamton University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a031262760164352c505a9e4feb9fa2e09789f","amp;dn":"Buddhism+as+Philosophy%3A+An+Introduction+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a031262760164352c505a9e4feb9fa2e09789f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,160,49,38,39,96,22,67,82,197,5,169,228,254,185,250,46,9,120,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
