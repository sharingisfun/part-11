Where contemporaries R.E.M. and HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ were fairly conventional in terms of song structure and melody, Sonic Youth began their career by abandoning any pretense of traditional rock &amp; roll conventions. Borrowing heavily from the free-form noise experimentalism of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and melding it with a performance art aesthetic borrowed from the New York post-punk avant-garde, Sonic Youth redefined what noise meant within rock &amp; roll. Sonic Youth rarely rocked, though they were inspired directly by hardcore punk, post-punk, and no wave. Instead, their dissonance, feedback, and alternate tunings created a new sonic landscape, one that redefined what rock guitar could do. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.94% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tGoofin'\nCatalog:\t\tGOO 2CD\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Intro\n02.Schizophrenia\n03.Tom Valence\n04.White Cross\n05.Kotton Krown\n06.Stereo Sanctity\n07.Brother James\n08.PipelineKill Time\n09.Catholic Block\n10.Tuff Gnarl\n11.Death Valley '69\n12.Beauty Lies In The Eye\n13.Expressway To Yr.
