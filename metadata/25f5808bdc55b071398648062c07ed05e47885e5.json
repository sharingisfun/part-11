The film was released direct to video in the United States by New Line Home Video in July 1994. In 2005, New Line Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on a double feature release alongside the original The Hidden.\n\n\nPlot\n----\nThe alien criminal from the first movie is dead, but he left a few eggs which are hatching now. The good alien (Lloyd Gallagher), who still inhabits Tom BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Michael Welden body, has been waiting just in case this happened. Unfortunately, his presence in the body has taken a terrible toll on it, draining it of life energy. Additionally relations with BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter Juliet (Kate Hodge) (now a cop) have deteriorated (possibly due to his bizarre behavior caused by the alien inhabiting inside his father). But when the killing starts again, they will need to work together to stop the new generation of aliens.\n\n...................................................................................\n\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player. \nJust burn the files onto a CD using Nero or Ashampoo Buring Studio by making a DATA CD.\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player \n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
