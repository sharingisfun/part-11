Wilkinson, Supraj R. Rajagopalan - Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine (6th edition)\nPublished: 2004-09-16 | ISBN: 0198525583 | CHM | 900 pages | 19 MB\n\n\nThe &quot;Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine&quot; covers all areas of internal medicine and provides rapid, on-the-spot access to evidence-based clinical management. Its characteristic style - combining incisive guidance with wit, a lucid style, and memorable epigrams - has been popular with generations of medical students and junior doctors the world over. There are a host of new features in this edition: new sections on common acute medical symptoms, and clinical skills; a new 'cheat sheet' on commonly used drugs; more colour plates, and more ECGs. There are numerous other updates and improvements throughout, many suggested by extensive market research. The pages have been redesigned in full colour. A new junior co-author has ensured that the text is just right for its market and tells medicine 'as it is'; and a panel of senior readers has approved every section. The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine&quot; is an utterly reliable 'friend in the pocket', any time of the day or night!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2618c29dc7191b04b4ae1555f479d6e13640afd2","amp;dn":"+Oxford+Handbook+of+Clinical+Medicine+%286th+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2618c29dc7191b04b4ae1555f479d6e13640afd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,24,194,157,199,25,27,4,180,174,21,85,244,121,214,225,54,64,175,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
