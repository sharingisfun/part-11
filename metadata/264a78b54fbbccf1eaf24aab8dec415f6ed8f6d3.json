Lock and load!\n\nSTORY:\n\noint Blank takes place in the country of Korogese. Since its inception, Korogese has risen through the ranks of global power at a meteoric rate. So fast, that the piecemeal government can no longer sustain itself and has been taken over by the massive corporations and merchants that grew out of its success. Now that the country has matured, and the populace is at peace, these same corporations are seeking to disarm the general populace with the promise of laws to protect the innocent and police to keep the peace.\n\nBut not all are so willing to accept this new form of peace. A group of rebels have risen from the ranks of the old defenders that kept their borders safe during their rise to power and formed a militia bent on making sure the corporations of Korogese never control the government. They refuse to be disarmed and will not listen to the will of the country's corporate masters. Calling on the tactics and skills that gave them the power to maintain the country's peace in years passed, they now seek to dismantle the machinations of the powerful corporations and merchants through guerilla warfare.\n\nFrom the corporations came Aegis Inc, a powerful, highly trained, para-military group that seeks to create a utopian society. From the groups of civilian rebels arose the The Corps, a skilled militia that holds to their rights as citizens and the upholders of the original Korogesian government. Both are fighting for their country, both are struggling to survive.
