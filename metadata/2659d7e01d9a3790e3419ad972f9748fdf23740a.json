Ã¢â‚¬ËœCherie DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Break My HeartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a stately semi ballad which could be a sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœIs This LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSex MachineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes the single entendre approach of Whitesnake, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœJudgement DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ borrows both a title and a Zeppelin-ish vibe from the Ã¢â‚¬ËœSnake.\n\nIf you like blues based hard rock with a touch of late eighties swagger, or are interested how Doug Aldrich got his big gig, then highly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2659d7e01d9a3790e3419ad972f9748fdf23740a","amp;dn":"Burning+Rain+-+Pleasure+To+Burn+Reissue+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2659d7e01d9a3790e3419ad972f9748fdf23740a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,89,215,224,29,154,55,144,227,65,154,217,114,249,116,143,223,35,116,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
