Mule, Ben Harper, Booker T and many others, and producer of acclaimed acts from Ryan Bingham to Phantom Limb. His outstanding new album will delight a legion of admirers who never knew he could embrace the wide open spaces of American roots music so brilliantly.\nHoly Ghost is the next chapter in a unique Anglo-American collaboration. After producing the second album by English country-soul talents Phantom Limb in 2012, Marc asked the band's Stew Jackson to return the favour. In sessions at Rockfield in Wales and the Shed in Bath, with his fellow Limb members, he helped Ford create this new career landmark. Marc's wife Kirsten contributes vocals, and his son Elijah, who's been working with Jackson on his own album project, adds guitars.\nFord, now living the quieter life in the Californian surf town of San Clemente, says: &quot;One day it just dawned on me, wait a minute, Phantom Limb is the perfect band for this. I said Ã¢â‚¬ËœStew, you allowed me to pull your baby apart and put it back together. I've never had a producer produce my own stuff. How about payback? You can do me now. I think I have some of the best songs I've ever written, and you've got a bitchin' band.' He just said Ã¢â‚¬ËœGet here.'&quot;\nAs Ford himself says of the inspiring results, &quot;it's hopeful, in a dark way sometimes.&quot; It's the work of an artist who's found the inner strength to recharge, personally and professionally. &quot;It's a reflection of my life,&quot; he says.\nFord plans UK dates around the release of Holy Ghost, an album which is all set to amplify his already unparalleled reputation and add to his distinguished body of work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:266a1037ddae67109208e456b5ea0e09c2afceaa","amp;dn":"Marc+Ford+-+Holy+Ghost+%5B2014%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"266a1037ddae67109208e456b5ea0e09c2afceaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,106,16,55,221,174,103,16,146,8,228,86,181,234,14,9,194,175,206,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
