We can glean a bit more from the Tradition of the Church. But where can we go to get the complete picture, to find out about the whole Mary? In an engaging style, Chris Padgett does just that as he walks us through what the Bible has to say about the Mother of God. What has she meant to the Church throughout the centuries, what have the saints told us about her, and most importantly, what we can learn from her ourselves?\n\nThis CD also includes selections from The Rosary Project, a unique celebration of prayer and song from Chris Padgett.\n\nFiletype: MP3\nLength: 41:12\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/get-to-know-the-mother-of-god&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/get-to-know-the-mother-of-god&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
