Originally, the BR 628 were ordered to replace the older &quot;Railbuses&quot; Class 795, 798 and 515.\n\nAfter 20 years, the Class 628-4 was developed as big brother of the first Class 628 and numbered as 628 401 till 628 450. In the period between 1992 and 1996, 309 railcars were build. The multiple units can be find in whole Germany on mainlines and branche lines. Due to the high number of vehicles, the BR628-4 forms the backbone of German passengertrains on non-electrified routes.\n\nIn this modern days, the BR628-4 is not powerfull enough for hilly routes. So the multiple units are now often replaced by newer diesel multiple units with two powered carriages, for example the BR 643 and 644 (Talent) and the BR 648 (LINT).\n\nToday, the multiple units can be still found on several german railway lines such as around Cologne. Some multiple units are operating for railway companies in Luxembourg and Romania.\n\nThe Class 628-4 can be operated in a maximum of four pairs and has a maximum speed of 120 kilometre per hour. The weight of a carriage is around 42 tons.\n\nYou find the online readme of the BR 628-4 here.\n\n \n\nIncludes\n\nThis package contains:\n\nDiesel Multiple Unit (DMU) BR 628-4\nRealistic sound effects (recorded from the real DMU).
