I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for The U:\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Miami, Florida, was at the center of a racial and cultural shift taking place throughout the country. Overwhelmed by riots and tensions, Miami was a city in flux, and the University of Miami football team served as a microcosm for this evolution. The image of the predominantly white university was forever changed when coach Howard Schnellenberger scoured some of the toughest ghettos in Florida to recruit mostly black players for his team. With a newly branded swagger, inspired and fueled by the quickly growing local Miami hip hop culture, these Hurricanes took on larger-than-life personalities and won four national titles between 1983 and 1991. Filmmaker Billy Corben, a Miami native and University of Miami alum, will tell the story of how these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad BoysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of football changed the attitude of the game they played, and how this serene campus was transformed into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe U.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c1fa7262f8a64b1e4388c1f07e5aa9131743c2","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+The+U+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c1fa7262f8a64b1e4388c1f07e5aa9131743c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,193,250,114,98,248,166,75,30,67,136,193,240,126,90,169,19,23,67,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
