THE PRACTICE OF MACRO SOCIAL WORK, Fourth Edition, challenges readers to use their concern, values, and critical thinking skills to assist those who struggle and have been excluded from making decisions that affect their lives--and to empower these less fortunate individuals to reclaim a healthy social environment for themselves and their children. The book's generalist orientation provides an organizational framework as well as history, biographical material on leading macro social workers, illustrative contemporary examples, and factual data that offers real life detail. Most important is the depth and wealth of practical information that assists readers in understanding how to help people engage in solving social problems, and in influencing social change to bring about a more just society and humane global civilization.\n\nAbout the Author\nWilliam Brueggemann is a professor in the Masters and Doctoral Program, School of Social Welfare, at Kyushu University of Health and Welfare in Japan. \n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\n1 Overview of the Practice of Macro Social Work 1\nPART I\nPractice of Helping Individuals and Groups Solve Problems and Make Social Change 19\n2 Action-Social Model of Macro Social Work 22\n3 Helping Individuals and Groups: Generalist Social Work Practice 45\n4 Conventional and Social Problems 77\n5 Solving Problems and Making Social Change 108\nPART II\nSocial Work Practice with Communities 137\n6 Community 139\n7 The Practice of Community Research and Planning 171\n8 The Practice of Community Development 210\n9 The Practice of Community Organizing 239\nPART III\nThe Practice of Social Work with Organizations 283\n10 Social Organizations 285\n11 Creating New Social Organizations 318\n12 The Practice of Social Work Administration 357\nPART IV\nSocial Work Practice at the National and International Levels 397\n13 Advocacy and Social Action: Making a Good Society 399\n14 The Practice of Social Work at the Global Level 435\nNotes 473","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d2d39ceec9c2afea427ce437ec6b35335ad645","amp;dn":"The+Practice+of+Macro+Social+Work+%284th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d2d39ceec9c2afea427ce437ec6b35335ad645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,210,211,156,238,201,194,175,234,66,124,228,55,236,107,53,51,90,214,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
