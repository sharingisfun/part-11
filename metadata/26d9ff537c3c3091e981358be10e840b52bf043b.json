According to the band, they chose the name 'April Wine' simply because members thought the two words sounded good together. The band has released more than 20 albums and continues to attract fans to its concerts, within and without Canada, more than 40 years after its beginning as a hard rock group.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnimal Grace is the eleventh studio album by Canadian rock band April Wine, released in 1984. At that time, it was said to be the final album the band would record, as its members all went in separate directions shortly thereafter. In 1992 however, April Wine reunited with a changed personnel line-up, and have continued to tour and record new material actively.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWalking Through Fire is the twelfth studio album by the Canadian rock band April Wine, released in 1985. The album was apparently not released until 1986 in the band's native Canada.\n\nWalking Through Fire was essentially a contractual obligation to the band's record label, to whom they still owed one album. However, by this time, the band had technically already broken up, and the album features only Myles Goodwyn and Brian Greenway from April Wine's &quot;classic line-up,&quot; augmented by three Montreal-based session musicians. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the album is generally considered one of the band's weaker efforts, although the Goodwyn-penned track, &quot;Love Has Remembered Me&quot; was a minor hit and has become one of the band's best-known ballads. The first single released from the album, a tune written by two members of Katrina and the Waves called &quot;Rock Myself to Sleep&quot; failed to make the charts.\n\nThe album itself peaked at number 174 on the U.S. album chart on October 12, 1985.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d9ff537c3c3091e981358be10e840b52bf043b","amp;dn":"April+Wine+-+Animal+Grace%2FWalking+Through+Fire+%5B2009%5D%5B320%5D%5BRMSTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d9ff537c3c3091e981358be10e840b52bf043b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,217,255,83,124,60,48,145,233,129,53,139,225,14,132,11,82,191,4,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
