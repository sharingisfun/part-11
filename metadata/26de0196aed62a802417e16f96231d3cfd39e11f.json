It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26de0196aed62a802417e16f96231d3cfd39e11f","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+The+Day+of+the+Doctor+2013+1080p+3D+BluRay+Half-OU+DT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26de0196aed62a802417e16f96231d3cfd39e11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,222,1,150,174,214,42,128,36,23,225,111,150,35,29,60,253,57,225,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
