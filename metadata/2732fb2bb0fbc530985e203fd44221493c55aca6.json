The premier divorce attorney in town, he is a forty-year old walking hunk of sex, bedding half the town, including his own clients. Brad is used to getting whatever, and whomever, he wants, and when the newest intern arrives - Julia Campbell, a pre-law student fresh off a failed engagement - he embraces the challenge. Only, happy in her new independence, the last thing Julia wants, or needs, is an older man who could destroy her job prospects, and possibly her innocence.\n\nJulia is confident in her sexuality, and her effect on men. But she is far out of her league. Before she knows it, Brad is stretching her boundaries and opening up a forbidden world of sensual and sexual exploration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2732fb2bb0fbc530985e203fd44221493c55aca6","amp;dn":"Blindfolded+Innocence+by+Alessandra+Torre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2732fb2bb0fbc530985e203fd44221493c55aca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,50,251,43,176,251,197,48,152,94,32,63,212,66,33,73,60,85,172,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
