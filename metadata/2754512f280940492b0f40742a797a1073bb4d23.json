Not sure why that isn't \non DVD yet either....but I liked it a lot.\n\nSomeone recorded this off-air when it first aired back \nin the day, so it has the original commercials and ABC show promos.\n\nRedd's guests in this show (the only one I have) are\nDon Knotts, Rodney Dangerfield, and sitcom actress\nLis Hartman (then known as &quot;Tabitha&quot;).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2754512f280940492b0f40742a797a1073bb4d23","amp;dn":"THE+REDD+FOXX+SHOW+--+with+Rodney+Dangerfield+and+Don+Knotts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2754512f280940492b0f40742a797a1073bb4d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,84,81,47,40,9,64,73,43,15,64,116,42,121,122,16,115,187,77,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
