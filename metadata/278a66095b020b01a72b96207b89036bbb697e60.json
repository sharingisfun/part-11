Gettext is used widely, in many programming languages and many projects â€“ from WordPress to many PHP projects, Django or pretty much anything on Linux.\r\n\r\nSimple &amp; Efficient Interface\r\n\r\nPoedit is intentionally spartan so that the focus is on the translation youâ€™re working on. Just you and the translation, no distractions.\r\n\r\nSafety Checks\r\n\r\nGettext can be tricky at times. One accidentally added % may break things if youâ€™re unlucky. Not to worry, though, Poedit checks for common problems and warns you.\r\n\r\nTranslation Memory\r\n\r\nPoedit comes with a builtin translation memory to help you translate faster. It remembers your past translations and uses them to make suggestions for similar texts. Over time, it learns enough to fill in frequently used strings for you.\r\n\r\nFor Developers Too\r\n\r\nDevelopers can use Poedit to maintain their translation files (or templates) and keep them fresh. It may be too simple for more complicated projects, but most of the time, that simplicity comes handy.\r\n\r\nPoedit is the perfect choice for translating WordPress\r\n\r\nOne of the largest users of Gettext today, WordPress uses PO files for everything: themes, plugins, WordPress core itself. With Poedit, youâ€™ll be able to translate any part of it quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nAnd the Pro version of Poedit comes with extra smarts: it understands WordPress themes and plugins.\r\nWith it, you literally donâ€™t need to know anything about the PO format, PHP source code or what not.\r\nWith Poedit Pro, itâ€™s as simple as it gets: point the app to your theme and let it analyze and prepare everything for you. \r\n\r\nHow does it work (Wordpress) ?\r\n\r\n- Poedit can handle any themes or plugins that are localization-ready. Most of the actively maintained ones are and the ones that arenâ€™t are often easily adapted. WordPress has great documentation on localization.\r\n- Themes and plugins are carefully analyzed to understand their structure. After this, the PO file is created in the right place and filled with texts.\r\n- Everything necessary to extract the texts is put in place. Donâ€™t worry about the technical mumbo-jumbo: gettext keywords, paths, settings, all that is taken care of to the maximum extent possible.\r\n- We keep an eye on popular themes and plugins to make sure Poedit has no trouble with them. Woo Commerce, Jetpack or any of the many many others, Poedit got it covered.\r\n- Updates are easy: just drop the translation into the updated sources, press Update and translate the new strings. No need to repeat work already done.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://poedit.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278a66095b020b01a72b96207b89036bbb697e60","amp;dn":"Poedit+Pro+1.8.6+Multilingual+Portable+%28Registered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278a66095b020b01a72b96207b89036bbb697e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,138,102,9,91,2,11,1,167,43,150,32,123,137,3,107,187,105,126,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
