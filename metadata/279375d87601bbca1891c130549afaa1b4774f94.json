You desperately want to build a growing audience of fans who love your characters, your stories, and the world in which you set them.\n\nBut chances are--unless you're a science fiction or fantasy writer--you're certain that you don't need to do any worldbuilding, because you equate building worlds with sticking a big fantasy map in the front of your book, and writing about aliens, or dwarves and elves and dragons.\n\nThe truth is, worldbuilding is the process of creating immersive fiction, of making it possible for your reader to experience the suspension of disbelief that allows him to live in your world.\n\n     Every fiction writer already worldbuilds.\n\n     Most writers simply do it badly.\n\nBecause most writers don't think they build worlds in their fiction, the worlds they build by accident:\nbreak their plots \nkill their pacing \ndestroy their conflict \nand eliminate their characters' motivation. \nBy learning easy, fast techniques for creating immersive story worlds, you can be the writer whose work wins the readers you want.\n\n     How easy? \n     How fast? \nYou can build your first world in about five minutes, and I've laid out this course so you can do this just by reading and doing the short workshop in the first chapter. You'll need a single piece of paper and a pen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279375d87601bbca1891c130549afaa1b4774f94","amp;dn":"Holly+Lisle%27s+Create+A+World+Clinic+%28Writing%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279375d87601bbca1891c130549afaa1b4774f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,147,117,216,118,1,187,202,24,145,193,48,84,154,250,161,180,119,79,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
