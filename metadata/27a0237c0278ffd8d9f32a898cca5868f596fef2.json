Shalimar, her wife, wishes Adijan would spend more time at home. Their landlord wishes Adijan would pay the rent. Adijan's brother-in-law wishes she would get trampled by a herd of camels so that he could marry his sister Shalimar to someone affluent and influential. And of all the wishes in the world, Adijan wishes the genie she's saddled with would grant her wishes instead of treating her with disdain. Be careful what you wish for in a world of genies, sorcerers, and flying carpets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a0237c0278ffd8d9f32a898cca5868f596fef2","amp;dn":"L-J+Baker+-+Adijan+and+Her+Genie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a0237c0278ffd8d9f32a898cca5868f596fef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,160,35,124,2,120,255,216,217,243,42,137,140,202,88,104,245,150,254,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
