Protect your privacy and computing habits \nfrom prying eyes and virtual trespassers with the help of Spyware Doctor. Anti-virus \nsoftware and firewalls do not fully protect your system against the majority of \nspyware and privacy threats. \nBecause spyware is commonly bundled with software downloads, attached to e-mails, or \ntransmitted through networks it can appear to be legitimate software, but once installed \nit can be nearly impossible to detect and remove without the help of a dedicated \nspyware removal tool like Spyware Doctor. \nSpyware Doctor is advanced technology designed especially for people, not just experts. \nThat is one reason why it won the People\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  39;s Choice Award in 2005, 2006 and 2007. \nIt is automatically configured out of the box to give you optimal protection with limited \ninteraction so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection.\nSpyware Doctor\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  39;s advanced IntelliGuard technology only alerts users on a true\nSpyware detection. \nThis is significant because you should not be interrupted by cryptic questions every time you \ninstall software, add a site to your favorites or change your PC settings. Such messages can \nbe confusing and lead to undesirable outcomes such as inoperable programs, lost favorites or \neven Spyware being allowed to install on the system.
