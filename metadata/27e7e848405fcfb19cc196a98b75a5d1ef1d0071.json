The film version keeps this failure record consistent. Ingrid Bergman plays a fabulously wealthy woman who returns to her impoverished home town. Years earlier, she had been driven from town in disgrace after sleeping with solid citizen Anthony Quinn. She now offers a deal to the city elders: Bergman will alleviate the city's financial difficulties--in exchange for Quinn's life. The original play ended with the lynching of the seducer; the film ends with Bergman halting the execution, proclaiming that by allowing Quinn to live, the townsfolk will be forced to feel the pangs of guilt over what they might have done for the rest of their lives. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058724/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058724/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nBernhard Wicki\n\n\n        Ingrid Bergman\t ... \tKarla Zachanassian\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tSerge Miller\n\tIrina Demick\t... \tAnya\n\tPaolo Stoppa\t... \tDoctor\n\tHans Christian Blech\t... \tCaptain Dobrik\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:40:14\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1519 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e7e848405fcfb19cc196a98b75a5d1ef1d0071","amp;dn":"The+Visit+%281964%29++Ingrid+Bergman%2C+Anthony+Quinn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e7e848405fcfb19cc196a98b75a5d1ef1d0071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,231,232,72,64,95,207,177,156,193,150,169,139,117,165,209,239,29,0,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
