The climate of Southern California has made it possible to plant the gardens with dozens of herbs, flowers, and fruit trees known to the Greeks and Romans. In classical times they were practical as well as beautiful, providing color, perfume, home medicines, and flavorings for food and drink.\r\n\r\nMartha Breen Bredemeyer, a San Francisco Bay area artist, was inspired to paint two dozen of the gardenâ€™s herbs.
