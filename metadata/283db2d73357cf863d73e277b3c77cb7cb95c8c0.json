The killers leave behind a distinctive saddle, that Morgan recognises as belonging to his old friend Craig Belden, now cattle baron in the town of Gun Hill. Belden is sympathetic, until it transpires that one of the murderers is his own son Rick, whom he refuses to hand over. Morgan is determined to capture Rick and take him away by the 9.00 train; but he is trapped in the town alone, with Belden and all his men now looking to kill him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:283db2d73357cf863d73e277b3c77cb7cb95c8c0","amp;dn":"Last+Train+From+Gun+Hill+++%28Western+1959%29++++Kirk+Douglas%2C+Antho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"283db2d73357cf863d73e277b3c77cb7cb95c8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,61,178,215,51,87,207,134,61,115,226,119,179,199,124,183,203,149,200,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
