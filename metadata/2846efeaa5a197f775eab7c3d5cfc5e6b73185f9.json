Divorced from a Nigerian wife, he has a five-year-old son, William, who lives with Adrian\\'s parents, now reunited, in Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Pauline Mole is resentful and bored, husband George is bedridden with clinical depression emanating from long-term unemployment and impotence. Rosie, George\\'s foul-mouthed daughter from his relationship with \\'Stick Insect\\', also lives with them. Pandora, meanwhile, with a university doctorate, has become a power-crazed Tory-in-disguise \\'Blair babe\\', standing as the Labour candidate in Ashby and duly winning her seat in the House of Commons. Adrian, who has become something of a whiny nerd, is still profoundly in love with Pandora, and he constantly envisages himself as crucial to her future, in either a political or matrimonial role. She, however, verbally cruel and relentlessly ambitious, will have none of it. Her father Ivan, with unfulfilled sexual urges, is not shy to cross the bridge, though, dallying with Pauline Mole.\n\nCAST\n\nStephen Mangan, Alison Steadman, Helen Baxendale","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2846efeaa5a197f775eab7c3d5cfc5e6b73185f9","amp;dn":"Adrian+Mole%3A+The+Cappuccino+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2846efeaa5a197f775eab7c3d5cfc5e6b73185f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,70,239,234,165,161,151,247,117,234,183,195,213,207,197,230,183,49,133,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
