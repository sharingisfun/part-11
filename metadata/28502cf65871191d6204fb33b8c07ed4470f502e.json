While many of Britainâ€™s worst tragedies are covered in depth, such as Quintinshill in 1915 and Harrow &amp; Wealdstone in 1952, the book also looks at others that had resounding consequences for safety.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nRobin Jones is a widely published and highly respected journalist who specialises in heritage transportation and industrial archaeology subjects. Robin contributes news and feature material on a regular basis across a wide range of railway titles and has written many books on Britainâ€™s railway history.
