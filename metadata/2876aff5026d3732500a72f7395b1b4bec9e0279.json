This lesson breaks down how to manipulate sounds before (or after) you sample them, finding new and creative ways to isolate specific pieces of a sound to sample. Ken takes a classic sample (used in Jay ZÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Roc Boys&quot;) and shows you how to isolate the horns only and remove the drums and bass, or isolate the bassline only, snares only, etc... as well as layer different pieces of the sample together to create new sounds and moods.\n\n\nKen Lewis then takes you through 3 more samples showing how to take boring straight ahead drum loops and add energy and presence to them using EQ, compression, filtering, M/S Equalization, and phase inversion. Ken breaks down &quot;A Minus B&quot; listening and how it can transform your sample sources into completely new sounds.\n\nKen presents everything step by step in this 1 hour and 18 minute lesson that includes the video as well as a full Pro Tools session and consolidated audio stems for use with any DAW. See all of Ken's plugin settings both on screen and in the included session, then practice your own sample transformations on your DAW and see what new combinations and techniques you come up with. This lesson will definitely take your sample game to the next level. Watch the five minute introduction video and you'll be convinced.\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour 18 minutes\nDownload size: 904 meg\nSkill Level: Junior / Senior\nGenre: Hip Hop / Sampling\nResolution: 1200x720\n\n*** PRO TOOLS 7 through 10 SESSION INCLUDED ***\n*** CONSOLIDATED AUDIO STEMS INCLUDED FOR ANY DAW****\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
