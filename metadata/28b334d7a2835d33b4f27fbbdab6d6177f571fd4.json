Their music combines fast and heavy    \n rhythms with dramatic poppy singing and deep throated, hardcore   \n growls. They draw influences from pop punk, hardcore, and         \n metalcore, creating a sound which can be classified as ?pop-mosh?.\n They have released two albums. Their first, ?And Their Name Was   \n Treason?, was released in 2005 on Indianola Records. The second,  \n ?For Those Who Have Heart?, was released January of 2007 with     \n Victory Records.                                                  \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b334d7a2835d33b4f27fbbdab6d6177f571fd4","amp;dn":"A+Day+to+Remember+-+For+Those+Who+Have+Heart+%282007%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28b334d7a2835d33b4f27fbbdab6d6177f571fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,179,52,215,162,131,93,51,180,242,127,187,218,182,214,23,127,87,31,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
