It differs from its predecessor is that the current assembly includes updates as of December 14, 2013, an activator replaced the more advanced version, plus fixes some bugs of the last release.\n\nComposition\nSo, this assembly includes 4 Russian edition and 4 English version of Windows 7 SP1 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) kernel:\n\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64 English\n- Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 x64 English\n\nEfficiency of the assembly as far as possible carefully checked.\n\nAfter installation, you get a fully registered and activated version of Windows 7, the chosen wording.\n\nImage size and CRC\nImage size: 3.86 GB (4,152,819,712 bytes)\nMD5-sum image: bede0181d8656afb2aeb427e20ff32bc\nSHA1-sum image: 9fa89d809d0d0f5b82d5e700adcf32988e6d68df\n\nSome features of the assembly\n- The original installer of Windows 7 is replaced by slightly redesigned installer from Windows 8.\n- In the assembly of integrated all critical updates available as of December 14, 2013, including Internet Explorer 11.\n- Instead of the default embedded with updates Microsoft. NET Framework 4 Client Profile in the assembly of integrated lightweight version. NET Framework 4.5.1 (project [Slim]. NET Framework 4.5.1 Full x86/x64).\n- In the assembly of integrated Microsoft Visual C + + 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013 Redistributable Package latest versions. To avoid duplicating install different applications earlier versions and redirect programs that require these packages libraries on recent versions, installing older versions locked plugs (project [addon] Microsoft Visual C + + 2005-2008-2010-2012-2013 Redistributable Package Hybrid).\n- At the earliest stage of the installation has pre-load a menu where you can select the bit of the primary shell, that is what the installer is used, x86 or x64. Because of this, you should not worry that the 64-bit version of the OS can not stand up for RAID, and that users of 64-bit operating systems may be without service recovery system. For the most inquisitive: Do not attempt to install the 32-bit version of the OS with the 64-bit version - the final stage of deployment installer will throw an error and refuses to continue the installation.\n- In the System Restore service that runs from the installation media, module is integrated Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) 8.0.1, and recovery service that is built into the system - MSDaRT 7.0, which greatly expands the possibilities of resuscitation system.\n- For technical reasons, from the System Restore launched from the installation media, excluded item &quot;System Restore&quot; allows to roll back the system to previously established control points.\n- In the 32-bit version of System Restore, launched from the installation media, integrated program AntiSMS 4.1 for fast automatic blocker treatment and Trojans.\n- After installation, the system will be activated built-in assembly activator, which is based on the method of activating a KMS-server.\n- With the included assembly KMS-activator can activate not only Windows, but Office 2010 VL, and Office 2013 VL.\n- If you choose to install Windows 7 Enterprise (Corporate), then after installation you will be able to switch the interface language from English to Russian and back standard means Windows 7 Enterprise (Corporate). If you installed Windows 7 Professional (Professional), you can use for this purpose utility Vistalizator, which is available in the shortcut in the start menu of Windows (Start Menu-&gt; All Programs).\n- For technical reasons, no system with this assembly can not be updated for Windows Vista / 7. However, if you must install from under the existing system, is able to initiate a so-called Custom installation. When you run the installation already running under 32-bit OS, it's simple. But to initiate the installation of under 64-bit OS, you do not start it via setup.exe in the root distribution media, and through setup.exe, which is located in the Sources folder distribution. Avtoran bootable media when running under an existing operating system, select the desired type of launch itself.\n\nDifferences to build Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 IE10 + RUS-ENG x86-x64 KMS-activation of May 25, 2013\n- This assembly contains not only the editors Enterprise, but Professional.\n- Old, now junk KMS-activator replaced by a new, capable of activating not only Windows, but Office 2010 VL, and Office 2013 VL.\n- The original installer of Windows 7 is replaced by slightly redesigned installer from Windows 8.\n- In the assembly of integrated all critical updates available as of December 14, 2013, including Internet Explorer 11.\n- Instead of me earlier embedded package [Slim]. NET Framework 4.5 Full x86/x64, in the assembly of integrated [Slim]. NET Framework 4.5.1 Full x86/x64.\n- Instead of me earlier embedded package [addon] Microsoft Visual C + + 2005-2008-2010-2012 Redistributable Package Hybrid, in the assembly of integrated [addon] Microsoft Visual C + + 2005-2008-2010-2012-2013 Redistributable Package Hybrid).\n- In the System Restore service that runs from the installation media, integrated module MSDaRT 8.0.1, which greatly expands the possibilities of resuscitation system.\n- For technical reasons, from the System Restore launched from the installation media, excluded item &quot;System Restore&quot; allows to roll back the system to previously established control points.\n- In the 32-bit version of System Restore, launched from the installation media, integrated program AntiSMS 4.1 for fast automatic blocker treatment and Trojans.\n- Of the installed OS excluded previously introduced me there USB3 drivers from different manufacturers. In my view, it is enough that the installer supports USB3. And in the system after the installation, everyone will be able to add it needed drivers.\n- Other minor changes.\n\nFor more information about activation\nFor automatic activation system for mounting the assembly, it does not need the Internet - everything happens automatically in offline mode. This is possible, because the basis of the activator is KMScmd 3.02 Portable from Ratiborus and Evgeny972, which works on the principle of KMS-activated, but without the need for Internet access.\n\nIn the target system provides a mechanism for reactivation. It can be initiated by running the shortcut &quot;Windows &amp; Office KMS-activation&quot; in the start menu of Windows (Start Menu-&gt; All Programs). When you run this activator you get the choice to activate the system by a single start a local KMS-server by writing a delayed start activator scheduler with automatic reactivation every 25 days, or by using the remote KMS-server.\n\nIn the first case, the activator will activate just for a period of 180 days and cleaned up after themselves. Second, almost all the same, but the activator still be registered in the scheduler with automatic start every 25 days to reactivate the system without user intervention. The third method is left as an alternative to the local KMS-server and requires access to the Internet for their work.\n\nI think you noticed that the label name &quot;Windows &amp; Office KMS-activation&quot; means not only the ability to activate Windows, but Office. And this is partly true. Activator is able to activate Office 2010 VL and Office 2013 VL. Available activation mechanisms are similar to the mechanisms of activation Windows, described above. Except for the fact that the method of activation Windows, requiring for their work internet access to Office, I did not develop.\n\nTool kit\nA set of tools Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) helps to diagnose and troubleshoot the system arising from the start, as well as other problems.\n\nThe kit includes the following tools:\n\n- Editing the registry.
