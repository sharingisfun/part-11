The events are mixed with a refrain asserting &quot;we didn&amp;#039;t start the fire&quot;. The song was a number-one hit in the U.S.\n\nThe song and video have been interpreted as a rebuttal to criticism of Joel&amp;#039;s Baby Boomer generation, from both its preceding and succeeding generations, that they were responsible for much of the world&amp;#039;s problems. The song&amp;#039;s title and refrain imply that the frenzied and troubled state which others were criticizing had been the state of the world since long before his generation&amp;#039;s time, but that this was being ignored by their critics. This message contrasts strongly with the song &quot;Allentown&quot;, written earlier in his career, which blamed his parents&amp;#039; generation for contemporary problems.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ed6d78bb2db3d3f9a0c8dd55e12cdb052c9f6e","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+We+Didn%5C%27t+Start+The+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ed6d78bb2db3d3f9a0c8dd55e12cdb052c9f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,237,109,120,187,45,179,211,249,160,200,221,85,225,44,219,5,44,159,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
