In his long career he was always best known for his bongo playing, although he also performed on conga frequently. He gained fame for his work in the late '40s with Stan Kenton's orchestra and as a member of the Nat King Cole Trio (which became a quartet) during 1949-1953. Since then, Costanzo has been heard in a wide variety of settings.\n\nDuring the bongo craze, Costanzo was hired by several different labels to record albums under his own name that spotlighted his bongo and conga work. He  also acted occasionally, appearing in the television series &quot;Staccato&quot; and movies such as &quot;Thrill in Brazil&quot; and the Jerry Lewis version of Gore Vidal's &quot;Visit to a Small Planet.&quot;\n\nMr. BONGO compiles some of Jack Costanzo's best tracks, showcasing Costanzo's powerful bongos and Eddie Cano's piano.\n\nThe keywords here are variation and versatility: the rhythms and musical styles range from typical Cuban Guajira (&quot;Meloda De Cana&quot;) and Guaracha (&quot;Goza Negra&quot;), over mambo (&quot;La La La&quot;, &quot;Abaniquito&quot;), cha-cha (&quot;El Resbaloso&quot;) and other Afro-Cuban patterns, to boogaloo (which is Latin dancefloor funk-jazz, often with screaming electric guitar, like here in &quot;Viva Tirado&quot;, a song made famous by El Chicano). Half of the 16 tracks are vocal, the other half instrumental; except for two tracks (&quot;Bongo Festeris&quot; and &quot;Abaniquito&quot;), the bongo is not featured as a solo instrument. \n\nThe repertoire includes Cuban traditionals, and standards like &quot;Just One Of Those Things&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot; done as mambo, a Latin pop version of &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, a really stomping &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, and by far the hottest and most swinging version of &quot;Caravan&quot; ever! Other favorites here include a novelty-esque mambo version of &quot;Chopsticks&quot;, that starts with Eddie Cano's interpretation of his first piano lesson, a remarkable fusion of Mariachi and boogaloo in &quot;Cu Cu Ru Curu&quot;, and &quot;Bongo Festeris&quot;, with its ferocious bongo solo. \n\nRecommended, especially for Mongo Santamaria and Tito Puente fans.\n\n\n\nCD / 1998 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1  Coco May May \t\n2  Viva Tirado (*)\t\n3  La La La \t\n4  El Resbaloso \t\n5  Chopsticks Mambo \t\n6  Melado De Cana \t\n7  Abaniquito \t\n8  Cu Cu Ru Curu (*)\t\n9  Goza Negra \t\n10 Pata Pata (*)\t\n11 Just One Of Those Things \t\n12 La Bamba (*)\t\n13 Caravan \t\n14 Chicken And Rice (*)\t\n15 Guantanamera (*)\t\n16 Bongo Festeris \n\n\t\nPersonnel:\nJack Costanzo, Bongos and Leader\nJohn Anderson, Paul LÃƒÂ³pez, Tony Terran, Trumpets\nWilly Gallardo, Timbales\nManuel Ochoa (Kaskara), Vocals and Maracas\nEddie GÃƒÂ³mez, Claves\nRamÃƒÂ³n &quot;Ray&quot; Rivera, Conga\nEddie Cano, Piano\nErnesto Montez, Bass\nMarda Saxon, Vocals\n\n\n\nCD Reissue of 1955 LP including Bonus Tracks (Tracks 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15). \nTrack sequence is different from vinyl releases.\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f40f7e0fc713cd8e38923c140f6eb95f140491","amp;dn":"Jack+Constanzo+%26amp%3B+His+Afro-Cuban+Band+-+Mr.+Bongo+1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f40f7e0fc713cd8e38923c140f6eb95f140491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,244,15,126,15,199,19,205,142,56,146,60,20,15,110,185,95,20,4,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
