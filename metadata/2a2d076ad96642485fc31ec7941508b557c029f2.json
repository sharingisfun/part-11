The first disc contains Slow Century itself, a 90-minute documentary with extensive interviews with the band members (as well as their friend Thurston Moore) and considerable live concert footage from across their career featuring throughout; indeed, the film concludes with the encore from their final live show, held in London in 1999. Unfortunately, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have disc 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2d076ad96642485fc31ec7941508b557c029f2","amp;dn":"Pavement+-+Slow+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2d076ad96642485fc31ec7941508b557c029f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,45,7,106,217,102,66,72,95,195,30,199,148,21,8,181,87,192,41,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
