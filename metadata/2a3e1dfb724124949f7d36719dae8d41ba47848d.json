In September 1946, Byas went to Europe to tour as one of the stars in Don Redman's big band. They were the first all black American orchestra to appear in the French capital since the liberation. Byas decided to remain in Europe and he settled in Paris, where he became a big star and was given a chance to record almost immediately. The saxophonist is accompanied here by local musicians such as Martial Solal and Pierre Michelot, as well as other illustrious American figures like Mary Lou Williams and Beryl Booker. Most of the quintet sides featuring guitar as the fifth instrument that were recorded during this period have been added as a bonus (these tracks feature extended solos by Byas).\n\nPERSONNEL &amp; MORE INFO ON SCANS\n\nCD 1:\n01.
