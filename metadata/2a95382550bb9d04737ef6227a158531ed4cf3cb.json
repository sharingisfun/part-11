I was told that these documents were being reviewed, and I would be contacted when the review was completed.\n\nFor years I waited, and was never contacted. The CIA, in fact, DID release the documents on three CD-ROMs yet they never notified me and my open FOIA request still pending in their office.\n\nAfter much frustration, I finally received the documents.  Below, you will find the links to the data on the CD-ROMS.\n\nThese files are organized in exactly the same way the CIA would send them to you. I simply created HTML indexes to make it even easier!\n\nThe directories contain .tif images of the documents (not my favorite format) and two other files. The .txt file is a poor excuse for a OCR (optical character recognition) of the document, which means they put the documents through a software title to make it text. You will see these are usually useless, because the process does not work on poorly photocopies documents. The .dat file in these directories is the one line description, as found in the index.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/mkultraindex.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mkultra/mkultraindex.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlso added part 1 of Henning Wittes interview with TI Andrea Laroche, \n\nwhich was missing from previous torrent.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a95382550bb9d04737ef6227a158531ed4cf3cb","amp;dn":"-%3D+CIA+Project+MK+ULTRA+20000+Documents++%3D-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a95382550bb9d04737ef6227a158531ed4cf3cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,149,56,37,80,187,157,4,115,126,246,34,122,21,133,49,237,76,243,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
