Within weeks of his launch, members of Congress were confronted by angry 'Tea Party' protesters.\r\n\r\nAs opposition grew, Obama's top advisers asked him to go for a less ambitious bill - he refused. His chief of staff knocked heads together inside his own party, as Democrats in Congress began to fight amongst themselves. The final battle was over abortion - the Catholic bishops tried to kill the bill. The hero who saved him was Sister Carol Keehan. She mobilised 59,000 US nuns and faced down the bishops to get Obama the votes he needed.\r\n\r\nBut in the midterm elections, Obama lost more seats in Congress than any president since 1938. The Tea Party now had 60 members and the Republicans would block all his future major reforms.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1.00 GiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 29s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 410 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 314 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2abe0421da88cdb3e056b100138700638a806fd7","amp;dn":"BBC+Inside+Obamas+White+House+2of4+Obamacare+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2abe0421da88cdb3e056b100138700638a806fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,190,4,33,218,136,205,179,224,86,177,0,19,135,0,99,138,128,111,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
