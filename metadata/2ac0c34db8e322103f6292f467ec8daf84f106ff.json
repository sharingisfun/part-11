Infrared Heating for Food and Agricultural Processing presents the latest applications of IR heating technology, focusing on thermal processing of food and agricultural products.\n\nCoverage Ranges from Fundamentals to Economic Benefits\n\nWith an emphasis on novel application, the text includes chapters that address such topics as:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Infrared heating system design\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Drying\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Blanching\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Baking\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Thawing\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pest management\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Food safety improvement\nWhere applicable, this readily accessible guide reviews case studies to address specific industrial issues and the economic benefits of IR heating. Infrared Heating for Food and Agricultural Processing is a well-organized resource for food processing engineers and also quality control and safety managers in food processing and food manufacturing operations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac0c34db8e322103f6292f467ec8daf84f106ff","amp;dn":"Infrared+Heating+for+Food+and+Agricultural+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac0c34db8e322103f6292f467ec8daf84f106ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,192,195,77,184,227,34,16,63,98,146,244,103,236,141,175,132,241,6,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
