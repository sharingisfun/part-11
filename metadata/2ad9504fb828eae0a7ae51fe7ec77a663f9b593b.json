Nantucket Sleighride failed to produce any hits but still remains a milestone for music history with the epic title song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. This song is a dedication to a man, Owen Coffin, who sacrificed his life aboard a ship lost at sea after taking a sleighride. Owen was eaten by his crew mates, which ultimately saved their lives. This song is one of the best written songs to come from Mountain and the live version is simply stunning! \n\nNantucket Sleighride is considered by many to be the best album from the band even though there were no charting hits. The production is top notch, with the musicianship being more polished than Ã¢â‚¬Å“Climbing!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nA1\t Don't Look Around3:42\nA2\t Taunta (Sammy's Tune)1:00\nA3\t Nantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin) 5:49\nA4\t You Can't Get Away 3:23\nA5\t Tired Angels (To J.M.H.) 4:39\nB1\t The Animal Trainer And The Toad 3:24\nB2\t My Lady 4:31\nB3\t Travelin' In The Dark (To E.M.P.) 4:21\nB4\t The Great Train Robbery 5:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad9504fb828eae0a7ae51fe7ec77a663f9b593b","amp;dn":"Mountain+-+Nantucket+Sleighride+%281971%29+%282003+Remaster%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad9504fb828eae0a7ae51fe7ec77a663f9b593b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,217,80,79,184,40,234,224,167,174,81,254,126,199,122,102,63,155,89,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
