The three members were barely past their teenage years when they became a musical sensation during 1972, scoring #1 hits and winning a Grammy for best new musical artist. Their recording success was almost entirely throughout the 1970s; some of the band's best known songs are &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; (both of which reached #1), &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;, and &quot;Lonely People&quot;.\nSome of the band's singles and albums were successful commercially, and they attracted the services of The Beatles' producer, George Martin, for a series of seven albums.\nThe band suffered a heavy blow when Dan Peek quit the group in 1977, right at its apex, but Beckley and Bunnell returned America to the top 10 as a duo with &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; in 1982. Continuing to tour, America maintains a loyal fan base and performs over 100 shows per year. \n\n\n**** [Greatest] CDRips 2011 [Bubanee]\nWill be CDRips from myself or other known 'Private Uploaders' \nThere will be NO TRANSCODED MP3s in any of these Collections.. \nThese Collections will not be proper albums due to the fact that most \n'Greatest Hits' contain not only the greatest hits but other added Music to \nround out the album.. \nMy aim is to remove the Music or non popular songs of that particular \nArtist/Band and leave the good stuff! (Hope my Judgement is good, hey.. lol)\nSo some will contain not many songs where others will contain more! and \nremember they will be once only CDRips, nothing but the best. Because that's \nwhat you deserve.. \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                America - Bubanee Best Of Collections\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: America\nAlbum................: Bubanee Best Of Collections\nGenre................: Soft Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2011\nRipper...............: dBpoweramp   (Secure mode) &amp; \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 244kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............:  on 1/1/2011\nPosted by............:  on 1/1/2011\nNews Server..........:\nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
