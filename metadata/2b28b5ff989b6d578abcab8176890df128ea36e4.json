Songs like the blues-rocking &quot;Follow the Dollar&quot; and the soulful, almost trip-hoppy &quot;Rows of Angels&quot; clearly demonstrate her nearly effortless ability to rock out powerfully in a not-entirely-straightforward way, while weird and eerie tracks like &quot;Two Tears&quot; and &quot;Simple Things&quot; expose a darker, more troubled side of her muse that sounds like it's been steeped a bit too long in Tom Waits' back catalog. At her best, she flexes musical muscles that are unlike any you're likely to encounter anywhere else: notice, for example, the deeply complex &quot;Little Bigman,&quot; a song that simultaneously evokes the British music hall, doo wop, '60s skiffle, and even traditional village bands, all as a setting for a wonderful vocal arrangement that never sounds quite as complicated as it actually is. And &quot;Simple Things&quot; takes horribly twisted guitars and a skittering funk beat and presses them into service behind what sounds like one of the most passionate and ambivalent love songs ever written. Not every moment is brilliant -- if it were, she'd be inhuman, and &quot;Mr. Magneto&quot; is indeed more than a bit self-indulgent (though the flamenco handclaps are a nice touch). But what's not brilliant is at least interesting, and easily 80-percent of it is brilliant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b28b5ff989b6d578abcab8176890df128ea36e4","amp;dn":"Eliza+Carthy+-+Dreams+Of+Breathing+Underwater+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b28b5ff989b6d578abcab8176890df128ea36e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,40,181,255,152,155,109,87,138,188,171,129,118,137,13,241,40,234,54,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
