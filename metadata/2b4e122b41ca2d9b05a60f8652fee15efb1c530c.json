The ISO is packed\nto lessen the time needed to downloading it. The packed\nfile is 246MB smaller than the raw ISO. Before you can \ndo anything with it you need to unpack it. If you don't\nhave a suitable unpacker on your system, google for one.\nThe ISO file was packed with WinRAR on an XP system and\nneeds no password. When unpacked, the ISO is 701MB.\n\n\nWhat's it for?\nThe Mac OS 8.6 ISO file is the &quot;mold&quot; for creating one or\nseveral instances of physical Mac OS 8.6 CDs. The physical\nCD can be used for booting up and installing the OS to many \nolder Macintosh computer models. Use your favourite burning\napplication or download one from the Internet. Please note\nthat you CANNOT use a rewritable CD for this if you want it\nto boot on most older Macintoshes! You do not need to burn\nthe ISO image on a Mac. The ISO standard describes a CD bit\nby bit and the burning system doesn't need to &quot;understand&quot;\nwhat's on the CD. Like a photocopier.\n\n\nWhy? Whyyyyy?\nThis is a silly question one often sees when older software\nis concerned. Just because there are Leopards and Vistas out\nthere doesn't mean all else is worthless. Relax and have some\nfun. If the shoe doesn't fit, don't wear it.\n\n\nHow do I use it?\nOn a Macintosh you boot from CD by holding down the &quot;C&quot; key\non the keyboard. The Mac OS CD of course must be in the drive.\nThe Mac will also boot from the CD if there's no system on \nthe hard disk. All Mac OS CDs are &quot;live&quot; CDs. A limited \nlive system booted from the CD will allow you to format a hard\ndrive and install a &quot;real&quot;, complete OS from it onto the hard\ndrive. The Mac OS 8.6 installation script is a bit odd, it\nrequres you to first double click on the generic OS installation\nicon and then it asks you what hardware it is on. If you double\nclick on the hardware specific script directly it will return\nan error.\n\n\nWhy 8.6 and not something better?\nThe Mac OS 8.6 will install on some Macintosh models than \nMac OS 9.x wont. Also, some Macintoshes, like early CRT iMacs,\nwill refuse to install Mac OS 9.x unless you upgrade their \nfirmware. You can't do this from Mac OS 9.x but can instead\nuse Mac OS 8.6. The necessary firmware files are all on the CD.\nBesides, I only have 8.6 in US English. My other Mac OSes are\nall in Swedish.\n\n\nIs it for my Macintosh model?\nGo to this Apple URL and see for yourself:\n\n\nWhat else?\nAn OS isn't much fun by itself. The empty space of the original\nCD has been filled with an assortment of system enhancements\nand other software, like Internet browsers and word processors.\n\nHere's a list of that extra material:\n\nAcrobat Reader \nFetch \niCab  \nInternet Explorer\nOutlook Express\nNetscape 7\nOS9VNC\nDave\nAdobe Type Reunion\nAdobe Type Manager\nFontBook\nTypeStyler\nA-Dock\nKaleidoscope + Aquamakeover\nDominoes (a game)\nCaptura\nGoldberg\nGraphic Converter\nFile Pirate\nFile Buddy\nHexEdit\nResEdit\nTattleTech\nTechTool Lite\niTunes\nQuickTime\nRealPlayer\nSoundApp\nWindows Media Player (for Mac obviously)\nAdobe Photoshop 6\nDreamweaver\nMariner Write + Calc\nStuffIt (packer)\nCarbonLib 1.6\nJava 2.2.6\nJoliet Volume Access\nSwitchRes\nToast 5\nEjectDisk\nMt Everything\nPCalc\n\nThe versions are the latest supported on OS 8.6 or just latest.\nMost will require that CarbonLib 1.6 is installed beforehand.\nMost are also packed in the .sit format, which means you'll\nneed to install StuffIt. Install it in the same directory where\nthe older version is installed and then erase the older version,\nelse the system will use the older version by default.\nThe same goes for Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and Netscape.\nAll the applications on this ISO will work nicely with\nMac OS 9.x as well.\n\nSome of these files, like the Aquamakeover Jaguar theme, can't\nbe found on the Internet anymore. \n\nIf you don't know what a program is about, google for it.\n\n\nWhat's the use?\nOlder systems can still be useful for productive work. This ISO\ncontains pretty much everything a small home office could ask for.\nIt is a tribute to all dumpster divers and hardware hamsters out there.\n\n\nHow long will it be seeded?\nA very short time by me. This weekend only. Don't ask why.\nYou guys will have to keep up the seed or reseed it at some other\ndate.\n\n\nWhat now?\nThis description will self-destruct in five seconds.\nNo, seriously, download it or don't, that's all.\n\n\n\nMac OS 9.2.1 US English is now uploaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b4e122b41ca2d9b05a60f8652fee15efb1c530c","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+8.6+US+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b4e122b41ca2d9b05a60f8652fee15efb1c530c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,78,18,43,65,202,45,155,5,166,15,134,82,254,225,94,251,28,83,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
