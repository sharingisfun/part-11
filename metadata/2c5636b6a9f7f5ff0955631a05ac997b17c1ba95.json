That's intentional, and that's also just how we\nsound together,&quot; Cantrell says of the record's deep, gritty sound. &quot;We're trying to\nmake a record that we dig and we're trying to keep the bar high for ourselves and see if we can get past it, and I think that we did again. And of course you want people to dig it too and to respond to it, and to have that start happening is satisfying.&quot;\n\nIt's started happening with the lead single and opening track, &quot;Hollow,&quot; which hit\nNumber One on the rock radio charts. Despite the fact that Alice in Chains' forays\ninto the murky waters have consistently proven to lead to both commercial and radio\nsuccess, Cantrell was still pleasantly surprised by the song's immediate acceptance.\n\n&quot;The initial response to 'Hollow' has been fucking incredible, totally not what we\nintended, and that's fucking awesome,&quot; he says. &quot;We just put that song out there for the fans and then it ended up turning into a number one single, a six-minute sludgy metal tune. That's always fun, to see something like that happen.&quot;\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Hollow                                               [05:41]\n02.Pretty done                                          [04:36]\n03.Stone                                                [04:23]\n04.Voices                                               [05:43]\n05.The devil put dinosaurs here                         [06:39]\n06.Lab monkey                                           [05:58]\n07.Low ceiling                                          [05:15]\n08.Breath on A window                                   [05:20]\n09.Scalpel                                              [05:21]\n10.Phantom limb                                         [07:08]\n11.Hung on A hook                                       [05:35]\n12.Choke                                                [05:44]\n________\n67:23 min\n112,2 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
