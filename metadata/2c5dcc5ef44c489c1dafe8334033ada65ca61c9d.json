Supported by theory, research, and current literature, the text focuses on CNS roles and scope of practice, expanding opportunities in primary and home care settings, and on outcomes of CNS practice across the care continuum. This second edition reflects two emerging trends affecting CNS practice: an increased focus on transitional care (continuity across the care setting continuum) and new Centers for Medicare Services reimbursement rules related to pressure ulcers, fall and infection prevention, and pain management. Additionally, the second edition places increased emphasis on CNS practice outcomes and newly emerging roles in chronic illness management in primary and home care settings.\n\nContributors to this edition represent the &quot;Who's Who&quot; of CNS Nursing. Outstanding features include text boxes throughout that highlight core competencies and practice outcomes identified in NACNS's Statement on Clinical Nurse Specialist Practice and Education. Additional chapter features include discussion questions, analysis and synthesis exercises, and clinical application considerations. The text also contains four models of CNS specialty care, and 10 exemplars of CNS practice, all including outcomes.\n\nNew to the Second Edition:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Increased focus on transitional care, primary care, program evaluation, and opportunities for CNS within the ACO and Medicare\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Emphasis on CNS role and practice outcomes pertaining to care of pressure ulcers, fall and infection prevention, and pain management\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New chapter on Program Evaluation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New chapter on Affordable Care Organizations: New Horizons for CNS Practice\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New chapter on economics of CNS practice\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New chapter on CNS in primary care","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5dcc5ef44c489c1dafe8334033ada65ca61c9d","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Clinical+Nurse+Specialist+Practice%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c5dcc5ef44c489c1dafe8334033ada65ca61c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,93,204,94,244,76,72,156,29,175,232,51,64,51,173,166,92,166,28,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
