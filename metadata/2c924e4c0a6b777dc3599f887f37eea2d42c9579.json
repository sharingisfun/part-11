A remote colony of the English crown, the island of Jamaica holds out against the vast supremacy of the Spanish empire. Devoid of London's luxuries, Port Royal, its capital, is a cutthroat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy houses. In this steamy climate, life can end swiftly by dysentery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or dagger. But for a daring soul like Captain Edward Hunter, this wild outpost in the New World can also lead to great fortune, if he abides by the island's code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking and the law of the land rests with those ruthless enough to make it. \n\nWord in port is that the Spanish galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is awaiting repairs in nearby Matanceros. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish harbor is guarded by the bloodthirsty Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV. With the Jamaican governor's backing, Hunter assembles a crew of ruffians to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon and its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloodiest tales of Matanceros legend, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he makes it onto the island's shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry stand between him and the treasure. \n\nWith the help of his cunning band, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake. But the danger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and adventure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are only just beginning. . . &quot;\n\nNOTE: This is one m4b file for Itunes and ipods, iphones etc. Please make sure you aware of this before trying to download for a player that doesn't support m4b (bookmarkable aac with coverart etc). No chapters, I do mine without it so I can see total time remaining on book. \n\nQuality: 89kpbs (anything over 64k is beautiful for audiobooks)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c924e4c0a6b777dc3599f887f37eea2d42c9579","amp;dn":"Pirate+Latitudes+%28Michael+Crichton%29+M4B+Itunes+Format+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c924e4c0a6b777dc3599f887f37eea2d42c9579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,146,78,76,10,107,119,125,195,89,159,136,127,55,238,162,212,44,149,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
