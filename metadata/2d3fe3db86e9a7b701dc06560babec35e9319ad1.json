Like rap groups such as Wu-Tang Clan, each of the constituent acts continues to record and perform independently as well as with Sweatshop Union.\n\nThey released their self-titled debut album independently in 2001; the following year, it was released on Battleaxe Records, Swollen Members&amp;#039; label, as Local 604.\n\nMembers of the group include Kyprios, Metty the DertMerchant, Mos Eisley, DJ Itchy Ron, Mr. Marmalade, Conscience and Dusty Melodica.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3fe3db86e9a7b701dc06560babec35e9319ad1","amp;dn":"Sweatshop+Union","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3fe3db86e9a7b701dc06560babec35e9319ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,63,227,219,134,233,167,183,1,220,6,86,11,171,236,53,233,49,154,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
