The two of them are gifted young player/composers whose work, like mine, is intimately connected to the possibilities and freedoms of electronic music. Over the last few years we've worked together several times, enjoying exploring the huge new sonic territories now available to musicians. Mostly the pieces on this album resulted not from 'composition' in the classical sense, but from improvisation. The improvisations are not attempts to end up with a song, but rather with a landscape, a feeling of a place and perhaps the suggestion of an event. In a sense they deliberately lack 'personality': there is no singer, no narrator, no guide as to what you ought to be feeling. If these pieces had been used in films, the film would complete the picture. As they stand, they are the mirror-image of silent movies - sound-only movies.'' --Brian Eno \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7e0e4f5be2f296c51f8f98955fab721e8ecbf8","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+-+Small+Craft+on+a+Milk+Sea+%5Bmp3-320-2010%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7e0e4f5be2f296c51f8f98955fab721e8ecbf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,126,14,79,91,226,242,150,197,31,143,152,149,95,171,114,30,142,203,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
