Now William Dunham gives them the attention they deserve. Dunham places each theorem within its historical context and explores the very human and often turbulent life of the creator Ã¢â‚¬â€ from Archimedes, the absentminded theoretician whose absorption in his work often precluded eating or bathing, to Gerolamo Cardano, the sixteenth-century mathematician whose accomplishments flourished despite a bizarre array of misadventures, to the paranoid genius of modern times, Georg Cantor. He also provides step-by-step proofs for the theorems, each easily accessible to readers with no more than a knowledge of high school mathematics.&quot;\n\nNotes: \n\n- Not my scan; I don't know where I got it (may have even been here) but it needed some extensive cleanup:\n-- Rescanned numerous images that were almost completely black\n-- Cleaned hundreds of pieces of garbage from the scans, ie blackness beyond page edges, specks and dirt, etc.\n-- Removed dozens of bitmapped words interspersed into the text and replaced with proper text\n-- Fixed a few dozen alignment issues\n\n- As far as I know, this book is not available commercially in e-Book form.\n\n- There's only a PDF as I find it a pain to convert to other formats... sorry.
