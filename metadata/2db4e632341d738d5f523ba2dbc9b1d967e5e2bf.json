In a bizarre, alternate version of the 1970&amp;#039;s you play as either one of the good Vigilantes or the evil Renegade Coyotes. Drive across varied destructible environments and blast your enemies into oblivion. You can follow a fast and furious storyline in Quest mode (complete with full-motion video rewards and unlockable characters) or simply go at it in deathmatch-style Arcade mode, blowing up your opponents and surroundings while collecting power-ups and awesome weaponry. The design team has obviously been influenced by the TWISTED METAL series, but has really gone beyond the call of duty improving on every feature one would expect in a fast-paced vehicular blast &amp;#039;em up. Get to know dangerous and wild &amp;#039;70s-style characters, drive tricked-out cars, trucks, and buses, and do your best to auto-exterminate the competition. VIGILANTE 8 is a smashing good time for deathrace dilettantes.\n\nWILL BE UPLOADING VIGILANTE 8-SECOND OFFENSIVE ONE DAY AFTER I FULLY SEED THIS...\n\n\nTested on Slim AND Fat with 3.40, 3.52, and 3.72 POPS and found 3.40 works best IMO.
