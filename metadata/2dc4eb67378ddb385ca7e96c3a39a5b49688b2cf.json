Beanie suggests that they form their own fraternity in Mitch&amp;#039;s new house on a college campus to re-live their glory days by bringing together a variety of misfit college students, losers, middle-aged and elderly retirees as their new friends and later try to avoid being evicted by the new Dean of Students, Pritchard, whom still holds a personal grudge against all three of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dc4eb67378ddb385ca7e96c3a39a5b49688b2cf","amp;dn":"OLD+SCHOOL++%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dc4eb67378ddb385ca7e96c3a39a5b49688b2cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,196,235,103,55,141,219,56,92,167,233,108,58,57,165,180,150,136,178,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
