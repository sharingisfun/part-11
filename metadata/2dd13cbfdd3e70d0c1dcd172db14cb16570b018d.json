Each episode was an eclectic, freeform mix of blues, folk, rockabilly, R&amp;B, soul, bebop, rock-and-roll, country and pop music, centered around a theme such as &quot;Weather,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; and &quot;Flowers&quot; with songs from artists as diverse as Patti Page and LL Cool J. Much of the material for the show's 100 episodes was culled from producer Eddie Gorodetsky's music collection, which reportedly includes more than 10,000 records and more than 140,000 digital files.\nInterspersed between the music segments were email readings, listener phone calls, vintage radio air checks, old radio promos and jingles, even older jokes from Dylan (&quot;My grandmother is so tidy she puts newspaper under the cuckoo clock&quot;), poetry recitations; taped messages from a variety of celebrities, musicians and comedians; and commentary from Dylan on the music and musicians as well as miscellanea related to the themes. The show was not live (Dylan taped his portions at various locations and while touring), and the studio location at the so-called &quot;Abernathy Building&quot; was fictitious. Most of the &quot;listener phone calls&quot; and emails were also fictitious, although at least one email read on the show came from an actual listener.\n\n\nEpisode 1: Weather\nEpisode 2: Mother\nEpisode 3: Drinking\nEpisode 4: Baseball\nEpisode 5: Coffee\nEpisode 6: Jail\nEpisode 7: Father\nEpisode 8: Wedding\nEpisode 9: Divorce\nEpisode 10: Summer\nEpisode 11: Flowers\nEpisode 12: Cars\nEpisode 13: Rich Man, Poor Man\nEpisode 14: The Devil\nEpisode 15: Eyes\nEpisode 16: Dogs\nEpisode 17: Friends &amp; Neighbors\nEpisode 18: Radio\nEpisode 19: The Bible\nEpisode 20: Musical Map\nEpisode 21: School\nEpisode 22: Telephone\nEpisode 23: Water\nEpisode 24: Time\nEpisode 25: Guns\nEpisode 26: Halloween\nEpisode 27: Dance\nEpisode 28: Sleep\nEpisode 29: Food\nEpisode 30: Thanksgiving Leftovers\nEpisode 31: Tennessee\nEpisode 32: Moon\nEpisode 33: Countdown\nEpisode 34: Christmas &amp; New Year's\nEpisode 35: Women's Names\nEpisode 36: Hair\nEpisode 37: Musical Instruments\nEpisode 38: Luck\nEpisode 39: Tears\nEpisode 40: Laughter\nEpisode 41: Heart\nEpisode 42: Shoes\nEpisode 43: Colors\nEpisode 44: Texas\nEpisode 45: Trains\nEpisode 46: More Trains\nEpisode 47: Fools\nEpisode 48: New York\nEpisode 49: Death &amp; Taxes\nEpisode 50: Spring Cleaning\n\nEach folder has the tracklisting included for that weeks show. This is lossless in the sense that it has been recorded straight from the XM signal to .WAV format without any lossy encoding. Not a true &quot;lossless&quot; in the traditional sense, but the quality is the best you will find until they are released by Dylan himself.\n\nNote:This was originally downloaded from HC, sorry, I forget who was the original uploader, but credit to them for all the hard work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dd13cbfdd3e70d0c1dcd172db14cb16570b018d","amp;dn":"Bob+Dyan-Theme+Time+Radio+Hour-Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dd13cbfdd3e70d0c1dcd172db14cb16570b018d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,209,60,191,221,62,112,208,193,220,209,114,219,20,203,22,87,11,1,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
