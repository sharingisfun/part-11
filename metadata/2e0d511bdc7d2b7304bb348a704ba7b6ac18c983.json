The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn. \nWhite Light, White Heat, White Trash is the last Social Distortion studio album to feature guitarist Dennis Danell who died on February 29, 2000, of a cerebral aneurysm at the age of 38. He did however appear on live album Live at the Roxy in 1998. \nIt is also the band's last release on Epic Records. \nThe album received Social Distortion's highest chart position at the time, entering the Billboard 200 album chart at #27. \nIn the first week of its release, White Light, White Heat, White Trash sold 30,000 copies. Stylistically, the album is harder and considered a return to their punk roots.\n\nThe title of the album is a play on the 1968 Velvet Underground album, White Light/White Heat. \nThe Velvet Underground record is known for being one of the most influential and well-known, and also one of the heaviest, records of its era, just as White Light, White Heat, White Trash for Social Distortion has a harder sound than those albums preceding it.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Mike Ness unless otherwise noted.\n\n    &quot;Dear Lover&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n    &quot;Don't Drag Me Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\n    &quot;Untitled&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:45\n    &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n    &quot;Through These Eyes&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Down on the World Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n    &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Gotta Know the Rules&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n    &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Pleasure Seeker&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n    &quot;Down Here (With the Rest of Us)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n    &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:49 *\n\n'*' indicates a hidden track.\nPersonnel\n\n    Mike Ness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitars, art direction, mixing\n    Dennis Danell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars\n    John Maurer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Deen Castronovo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (uncredited session drummer)\n    Chuck Biscuits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (credited as band member at the time of release, did not play on the album)\n    Michael Beinhorn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ producer\n\nmp3\n192k\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0d511bdc7d2b7304bb348a704ba7b6ac18c983","amp;dn":"Social+Distortion+-+White+Light%2C+White+Heat%2C+White+Trash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0d511bdc7d2b7304bb348a704ba7b6ac18c983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,13,81,27,220,125,43,115,4,187,52,138,112,75,167,182,172,24,201,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
