Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry WhittakerÃ¢â‚¬â€a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As AlmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite directionÃ¢â‚¬â€into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artistÃ¢â‚¬â€but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.\n\nExquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globeÃ¢â‚¬â€from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, whoÃ¢â‚¬â€born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬â€bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, GilbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Penguin Audio; Unabridged edition (October 1, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1611762022\nISBN-13: 978-1611762020\nRead by Juliet Stevenson \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 64 Kbps \nUnabridged\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
