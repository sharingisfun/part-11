She included a pair of tunes by country vocalist Lee Roy Parnell, &quot;What's a Girl to Do&quot; and &quot;Red Hot,&quot; doing both in a feisty, attacking fashion. She was also challenging and upbeat on Dr. John's &quot;How You Carry On&quot; and &quot;Find Another Fool.&quot; Her third Rounder album, Gatorhythms was one of her most entertaining and dynamic, as Ball became less of an interpreter and more of an individualist.
