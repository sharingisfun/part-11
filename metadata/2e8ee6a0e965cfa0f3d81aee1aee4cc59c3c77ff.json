The band is currently signed to Prosthetic Records. The band as a whole has been together since 2001 but has undergone many member changes. The band is known for their heavy downtuned guitars, irregular breakdowns, groove patterns, and for arguably popularizing the use of the tritone or &quot;brown note&quot; (an interval of a sharp fourth) in metalcore breakdowns. They have three studio albums. &quot;...And Life Is Very Long&quot; (Devil&amp;#039;s Head - 2002), &quot;3750&quot; (Prosthetic, Devil&amp;#039;s Head - 2004), and &quot;The Dead Walk&quot; (Prosthetic - 2006) as well as a split seven-inch record with then Devil&amp;#039;s Head lablemates Loyal To The Grave in which they cover the song &quot;Seasons In The Abyss&quot; which was originally recorded by the band Slayer. The band has worked with acclaimed producers Adam Dutkiewicz (Killswitch Engage) and Zeuss (Shadows Fall and Hatebreed).\n\nAlthough not something that the band is particularly proud of, the influence of The Acacia Strain can be measured in the surge in the use of the tritone breakdown in the works of the band&amp;#039;s North American contemporaries in the years following the release of 3750. The transition from power chord breakdowns to tritone breakdowns can be seen by comparing the earlier, more metal- and hardcore-influenced releases of bands such as For The Fallen Dreams, Emmure, Liferuiner, etc, to the same band&amp;#039;s more recent releases.\n\nThe Acacia Strain - Continent Tracklisting\n\n1.
