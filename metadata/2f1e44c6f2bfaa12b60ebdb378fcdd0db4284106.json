Recorded by radio and broadcasted nationwide, this great moment of blues live performance has been documented for the posterity. The bonus track (Gamblers Blues/Sweet Angel) delivers the Jam Session with Otis Rush and Eddie C. Clearwater of the same evening. CD 2 contains a live appearance at Buddy Guy's Legend, Chicago's famous live club, recorded in September of the same year. &quot;Live In Chicago&quot; is the first document out of the archive of the Luther Allison Holding Co., which was founded by Luther and his longtime companion Carolyn Brown (Rocky) some days before he died.\n\nThe blues world lost a treasure when Luther Allison died in 1997, just as he was finally garnering the recognition he so richly deserved. If there's any question of that, this live album, recorded at the 1995 Chicago Blues Festival and at Buddy Guy's Legends, will dispel any such notion. A performer and songwriter of the first order, Allison had the sort of mastery of his instrument that comes from long experience; whether rolling off licks on the &quot;Gambler's Blues/Sweet Little Angel&quot; medley, or playing extended solos on &quot;All the King's Horses,&quot; Allison's on the ball and in control at all times. This album contains mostly newer material previously recorded for Alligator Records, like &quot;Soul Fixin' Man,&quot; &quot;Bad Love,&quot; &quot;All the King's Horses,&quot; and &quot;What Have I Done Wrong?&quot; Overall, this is an excellent memorial to a musician who should be remembered.
