Molecular \n\nBiology 5/e focuses on the fundamental concepts of molecular biology emphasizing experimentation. In particular \n\nauthor, Rob Weaver, focuses on the study of genes and their activities at the molecular level. Through the \n\ncombination of excellent illustrations and clear, succinct writing students are presented fundamental molecular \n\nbiology concepts.\nRobert Weaver Received BS in Chemistry from The College of Wooster in 1964 Postdoctoral work at UC-San Francisco with \n\nWilliam Rutter American Cancer Society Research Scholar for two years. \n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nAbout the Author iv\nPreface xiii\nAcknowledgments xvii\nGuide to Experimental Techniques in\nMolecular Biology xix\nPART I - Introduction\nPART II - Methods in Molecular Biology\nPART III - Transcription in Bacteria\nPART IV - Transcription in Eukaryotes\nPART V - Post-Transcriptional Events\nPART VI - Translation\nPART VII - DNA Replication, Recombination, and Transposition\nPART VIII - Genomes\nGlossary 827\nIndex 856","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3d23a102157555fb9a83dee14cf1d1a0858f48","amp;dn":"Molecular+Biology+%285th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f3d23a102157555fb9a83dee14cf1d1a0858f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,61,35,161,2,21,117,85,251,154,131,222,225,76,241,209,160,133,143,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
