The then-newly appointed Rolling Stones guitarist decided to try something a little different on his third solo release overall, so he rounded up yet another all star cast of rockers - something Wood seems inclined to do with each solo album. \n\nPresent were some of his ex-bandmates in the Faces (Ronnie Lane, Kenny Jones, Ian McLagan), as well as such other rock notables as Rick Grech (ex-Blind Faith) and a few Stones sidemen (pianist Ian Stewart and horn-blowers Jim Price and Bobby Keys). Comprised of both instrumentals and actual songs, MAHONEY'S LAST STAND remains the most curious of Wood's solo releases.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
