As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded as Bob Seger and the Last Heard and Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the &quot;System&quot; from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with various other bands. In 1973, he put together the Silver Bullet Band, a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album Live Bullet, recorded live with the Silver Bullet Band in 1975 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album Night Moves. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums.\n\nA roots rocker with a classic raspy, shouting voice, Seger wrote and recorded songs that dealt with love, women and blue-collar themes and was an exemplar of heartland rock. Seger has recorded many hits, including &quot;Night Moves&quot;, &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, &quot;We've Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Shakedown&quot; that was written for Beverly Hills Cop II and &quot;Like a Rock&quot;, and also co-wrote the Eagles' number-one hit &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;. His iconic recording of &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001.\n\nWith a career spanning five decades, Seger continues to perform and record today. Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRide Out is the seventeenth studio album by American rock singerÃ¢â‚¬â€œsongwriter Bob Seger. The album was released on October 14, 2014. Seger has stated that this may be his final album.\n\nRide Out is Seger's first album of new material in eight years. After 2006's Face the Promise, it is the second studio album since 1975 to be credited to Bob Seger rather than Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band.\n\nBob Seger, talking about his motivations for Ride Out in a press release, Rumors about the album started to spread as far back as 2010. On July 13, 2011, Bob Seger reported via Facebook that he was recording new material at Ocean Way Recording in Nashville. A Rolling Stone article from February 16, 2012 suggested that the album would be released in September of that year, but it did not come out. On April 11, 2013, Seger told the audience at a live performance in Detroit: &quot;We should have our new album out in late AugustÃ¢â‚¬â€if we are lucky.&quot; That date was also not met. The official announcement of the album was finally made on August 18, 2014.\n\nSeger stated that he really made an effort to &quot;break new ground&quot; on this album and therefore, none of the songs on it would sound quite like anything he had done before. Seger said he approached this album differently in terms of feels and speeds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8565c70d519657f23ed4578ab24550f6169015","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+-+Ride+Out+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8565c70d519657f23ed4578ab24550f6169015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,133,101,199,13,81,150,87,242,62,212,87,138,178,69,80,246,22,144,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
