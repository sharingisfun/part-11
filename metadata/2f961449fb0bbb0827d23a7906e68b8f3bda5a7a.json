His parent's would rather he date and get married. He takes on this task with verve. Not knowing how to approach women in a romantic way, he watches how other men operate and tries to emulate them, most often without success. He ends up attracting the one woman he doesn't really want, a fun loving woman named Laurence who lives next door, but he becomes obsessed with Stella, a singer he sees on television. He believes her love song is being sung directly to him. As Pierre tries to get away from Laurence while pursuing Stella, he may miss the perfect match who may be right under his nose. \n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : Le.Soupirant.1962.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 143 Kbps\nLength            : 4.22 GiB for 1h 24mn 40s 784ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1200 x 720 (1.667) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056514/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056514/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: French\nSubtitles: English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img837/7504/9uelx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img837/7504/9uelx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img842/1066/8lc48.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img842/1066/8lc48.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img845/8282/d53f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img845/8282/d53f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img845/7228/69lom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img845/7228/69lom.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f961449fb0bbb0827d23a7906e68b8f3bda5a7a","amp;dn":"Le.Soupirant.1962.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f961449fb0bbb0827d23a7906e68b8f3bda5a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,150,20,73,251,11,187,8,39,210,58,121,6,230,139,143,59,218,90,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
