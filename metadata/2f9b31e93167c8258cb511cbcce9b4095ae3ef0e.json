This necessity for speed and manageable power consumption makes it likely that the next generation of embedded processing systems will include hundreds of cores, while being increasingly programmable, blending processors and configurable hardware in a power-efficient manner.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f9b31e93167c8258cb511cbcce9b4095ae3ef0e","amp;dn":"Multi+Core+Embedded+Systems-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f9b31e93167c8258cb511cbcce9b4095ae3ef0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,155,49,233,49,103,200,37,140,181,17,203,204,233,180,9,90,227,239,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
