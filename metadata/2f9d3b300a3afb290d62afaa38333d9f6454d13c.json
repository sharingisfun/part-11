Filled with succinct, yet highly informative entries, the four-volume Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia covers all of the planet's nation-states, as well as various tribes and marginalized peoples. Thus, in addition to coverage on countries as disparate as France, Ethiopia, and Tibet, there are also entries on Roma Gypsies, the Maori of New Zealand, and the Saami of northern Europe. There is even a section on food in outer space, detailing how and what astronauts eat and how they prepare for space travel as far as diet and nutrition are concerned.\n\nEach entry offers information about foodstuffs, meals, cooking methods, recipes, eating out, holidays and celebrations, and health and diet. Vignettes help readers better understand other cultures, while the inclusion of selected recipes lets them recreate dishes from other lands.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1434 pages\n# Publisher: Greenwood (May 25, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0313376263\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313376269","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f9d3b300a3afb290d62afaa38333d9f6454d13c","amp;dn":"Food+Cultures+of+the+World+Encyclopedia%28+4+vols%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f9d3b300a3afb290d62afaa38333d9f6454d13c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,157,59,48,10,58,251,41,13,98,175,170,56,51,61,159,100,84,209,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
