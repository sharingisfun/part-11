Life and death of Giovanni De' Medici, a young brave captain in the war of Charles V against the Pope, in the first half of 1500.\n\n** This comment may contain spoilers ***\n\nThis film is for audiences with some awareness of renaissance military and art history, being a cross between a documentary (the words, armoury and events are rigorously based on documented history) and a series of achingly beautiful, live renaissance frescoes (photography: Fabio Olmi).\n\nIt also hazards that that were it not for the betrayal of the Duke of Ferrara and his giving of four small cannon to the invading German forces of Emperor Charles V, not only might the young Joanni not have died as he did but the successful invasion and the sacking of the Papal state might not have occurred.\n\nJivkov as Joanni De Medici and the whole cast are excellent. In short, an uncompromising film from an uncompromising director.\n(Author: kasten-auxil from England)\n\nDVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 938 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 128 kbps 48 KHz\nResoluÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o: 640 x 368\nAspect Ratio: 1.739\nFormato de Tela: Widescreen (16x9)\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\nTamanho: 771.1 MiB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe0793d861db7089cb32e468b37b689f3f9a919","amp;dn":"Ermanno+Olmi+-+Il+Mestiere+delle+armi+AKA+The+Profession+of+Arms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe0793d861db7089cb32e468b37b689f3f9a919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,224,121,61,134,29,183,8,156,179,46,70,139,55,182,137,243,249,169,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
