Hitler was pumping a fortune into his new-fangled V weapons in the hope they could win him the war. But Medmenham had a secret weapon of its own, a simple stereoscope which brought to life every contour of the enemy landscape in perfect 3D.\n\nThe devil was truly in the detail and, together with extraordinary personal testimonies, the film uses modern computer graphics on the original wartime photographs to show just how the photo interpreters were able to uncover Hitler's nastiest secrets.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011cr8f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011cr8f&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nSource: HDTV\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged\n\nXvid and SRT also available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe0853e3147d20801b66997a6ff2248936f6a63","amp;dn":"BBC+Operation+Crossbow+720p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe0853e3147d20801b66997a6ff2248936f6a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,224,133,62,49,71,210,8,1,182,105,151,166,255,34,72,147,111,106,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
