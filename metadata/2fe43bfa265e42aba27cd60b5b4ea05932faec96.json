Its purpose: to help bosses stick it to their employees. Its author: none other than Dogbert, the canine corporate consultant out to rule the world.\nAll too often, new managers make mistakes such as rewarding good work with good pay, communicating clearly and improving departmental efficiency. Dogbert shows that this could have devastating consequences: Employees begin to expect fair treatment and compensation, productive workers show results (making managers look bad by comparison), and the department's future budget allotment could be decreased because it spends only what it needs.\nDrawing from his years of experience tormenting Dilbert and advising his boss, our Machiavellian mutt uses pithy essays, illustrated by scores of comic strips, to teach neophyte managers such potent practices as:\n\n* The power of verbal instructions: Sound like a boss while maintaining complete deniability!\n* Empty promises of promotion: all the motivational benefits, none of the costs!\n* Pretending to care: Learn how to hear without listening!\n* Incentives: Inspire employees by giving them worthless knickknacks!\n\nOnce again firmly establishing Scott Adams as the spokesman for the absurdities of the workplace (and Dogbert as the guru of sticking it to the masses), Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook is the perfect gift for all cubicle dwellers and their bosses.\n\nInFo:\nBook Author:.......: Scott Adams\nAudiobook ISBN:....: 0694517720\nCategory:..........: Comedy, Satire\nPublisher..........: Harper Audio\nAudio Length:......: 1 hour and 22 min.\nBitrate:...........: 64 Kbps\nFile Size:.........: 37 MB\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nHuge selection of audiobooks now available at the blog:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe43bfa265e42aba27cd60b5b4ea05932faec96","amp;dn":"Dogbert%5C%27s+Top+Secret+Management+Handbook+-+Scott+Adams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe43bfa265e42aba27cd60b5b4ea05932faec96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,228,59,250,38,94,66,171,162,124,214,11,91,78,160,89,50,250,236,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
