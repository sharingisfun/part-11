Wielding my potent Ice and Stone elemental magic will only get me so farâ€”my real secret is my tight-knit makeshift family, a motley crew of cops and criminals, dwarves and playboys. My foster brother Finnegan Lane is my right-hand man, but when his suddenly not-dead relative comes back into the picture, Iâ€™m the one on the outside looking in. \r\nItâ€™s funny how life works: one minute your best friend is rock-steady, and the next heâ€™s doe-eyed and buying into this whole loving-relative routine to the point of ignoring you. Iâ€™d like to be happy for Finn, I really would. But all of my instincts are telling me that beneath the syrupy sweet demeanor and old-fashioned charm, this sudden interloper is planning something.

This person might have avoided the grave once, but Iâ€™ll put anyone who hurts Finn in the groundâ€”for good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe840d378e161c94e14e7342c7c679378d04b3a","amp;dn":"Bitter+Bite+%28Elemental+Assassin+%2314%29+by+Jennifer+Estep+%5BePUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe840d378e161c94e14e7342c7c679378d04b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,232,64,211,120,225,97,201,78,20,231,52,44,124,103,147,120,208,75,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
