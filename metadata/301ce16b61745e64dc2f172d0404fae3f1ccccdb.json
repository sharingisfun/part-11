These songs are caustic and\nunapologetic, with ear-splitting guitars and energetic drumming. Both &quot;Moonbaby&quot; and &quot;Timebomb&quot; are fraught with explosive guitar riffs, while &quot;Voodoo&quot; does an about-face and confronts the theme of obsessive love with full-bodied percussion. Godsmack's innovative use of sample mixing may lead to the erroneous conclusion that this reissued release sought to capitalize on sounds made fashionable by the likes of Prodigy and Monster Magnet. But one listen to Sully Erna's achingly brittle vocals is all that's needed to fully convince anyone that Godsmack makes serious hard rock. \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Moon baby [04:23] \n 02.Whatever [03:26] \n 03.Keep away [04:50] \n 04.Time bomb [04:00] \n 05.Bad religion [03:13] \n 06.Immune [04:50] \n 07.Someone in london [02:03] \n 08.Get up get out [03:30] \n 09.Now or never [05:06] \n 10.Stress [05:04] \n 11.Situation [05:48] \n 12.Voodoo [09:04] \n ____ \n \n 55:17 min \n 90,2 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:301ce16b61745e64dc2f172d0404fae3f1ccccdb","amp;dn":"Godsmack-Godsmack-%28Retail%29-1997-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"301ce16b61745e64dc2f172d0404fae3f1ccccdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,28,225,107,97,116,94,100,220,47,23,45,4,4,250,227,241,204,204,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
