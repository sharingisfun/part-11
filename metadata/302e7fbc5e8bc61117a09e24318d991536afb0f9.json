Catching it all in the studio has been harder, like juggling snakes and feral cats. Singer-guitarist Luther Dickinson, his drumming brother, Cody, and bassist Chris Chew come close here by lacing hard stuff like &quot;New Orleans Walkin' Dead&quot; with a spare fireside tension in the closing good time &quot;Jellyrollin' All Over Heaven&quot; and a spectral version of Bob Dylan's &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again&quot; that truly takes the song down South.\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
