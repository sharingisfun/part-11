The other two films were Siu lam juk kau (2001) (Shaolin Soccer) and Ying xiong (2002) (Hero). The latter films were eventually given U.S. theatrical releases in 2004. This film was released straight-to-DVD in August 2005.\n\nThis movie is SOOOO..., 15 August 2003\nAuthor: Wilpuri from Finland\n\n... fantastic. This movie contains great actors, good CGI and beautiful cinematography! The special effects aren&amp;#039;t as realistic as in most Hollywood movies, but they&amp;#039;re far more original and stylish. And you just have to love the voice of Insomnia (the BAD dude of this movie)!!! It&amp;#039;s great! I also liked the fairy played by gorgeous Kelly Lin. \n\nThere&amp;#039;s just so much great things in this movie! It&amp;#039;s far from perfect, but a LOT better than Hollywood special effect -movies such as The Mummy or Tomb Raider... actually I think it&amp;#039;s even better (at least more original) than The Matrix.\n\nI haven&amp;#039;t seen the old ZU yet (I just bought it), but I guess it would be useless to compare the movies anyway. I guess this new version is VERY different from the old Zu warriors.\n\nIf you can handle a bit complicated and weird story and like over-the-top superhero/fantasy -action, then this movie is FOR you!\n\nFive reasons to watch this:\n\n1. Great special effects 2. Tsui Hark 3. Cecilia Cheung, Sammo Hung, Ekin Cheng and co. 4. Tsui Hark 5. The great music.\n\nEnjoy and plaese seed.
