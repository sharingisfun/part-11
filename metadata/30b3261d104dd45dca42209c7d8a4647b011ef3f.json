The game continues the story of hero Wesley Gibson, picking up the action where the film leaves off and creating an entirely new chapter exploring both WesleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey to becoming an unmatched ÃƒÂ¼berassassin and the epic fiction of &quot;The Fraternity.&quot;\n\nFeaturing intense third-person action, the Wanted video game will take combat to the next level with iconic moves -- such as &quot;Curving Bullets&quot; and &quot;Assassin Time&quot; -- drawn directly from the film, as well as an innovative, multi-layered cover mechanic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30b3261d104dd45dca42209c7d8a4647b011ef3f","amp;dn":"Wanted%3A+Weapons+of+Fate+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30b3261d104dd45dca42209c7d8a4647b011ef3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,179,38,29,16,77,212,93,202,66,32,156,125,138,70,71,176,17,239,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
