It will be released in May/June 2010.\n\nOnce again recorded in their home domain of Kinshasa, DR Congo by Congotronics series producer Vincent Kenis, the long-anticipated follow-up to Konono's 2005 debut sees their trademark thrilling junkyard sonics and relentlessly hypnotic percussive grooves (as created using thumb pianos and drums made from scrap metal and disused car parts) further elevated with electric guitars and bass - played by neighbourhood musicians from a young Konono covers band! - as well as a wider range of vocalists plus guest appearances from guitarist Manuaku Pepe Felly (ZaÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿ko Langa Langa) and members of fellow Congotronics band Kasai Allstars. \n\nThe band's music is and will always be a very precise mixture of traditonal bazombo trance music with the distortion of their modern home-made equipment... but their sound on &quot;Assume Crash Position&quot; is somehow deeper, more layered and ethereal, without losing any of that signature raw power and driving energy. Those gloriously extended full band tracks take off like never before - but also, for the first time, we hear Konono stripped right back to their essence: the album's final song, &quot;Nakobala Lisusu Te&quot;, features just the band's founder and master, Mingiedi (now in his late-seventies) and his likembe. &quot;I don't feel like getting married any more&quot;, he sings in sweet and mournful tones, &quot;because women nowadays think marriage is just a six month affair&quot;. \n\nThe album title is a rough translation from the Kikongo meaning of  &quot;Konono&quot;, and if you've heard or seen the band in full flight before you'll have some idea of the ride you're in for here. If not - well, strap yourselves in... \n\nAssume Crash Position will be coming out on CD... and also on vinyl, only as part of the limited-edition 7-vinyl Congotronics Vinyl Box Set, only available on pre-order from the Crammed online store\n-- crammed.be\n\n&quot;A blend of traditional Bazombo folk with gritty sound distortions that would make Jimi Hendrix proud...
