If you already have any of these, and you're able to offer a little seeding help today, it would be appreciated.\n\nI've been at this for a few days now, 24 hours a day, and I'm really looking forward to getting these previously shared albums behind me.  I've still got 1.42 gigs of last months music to share, and about 3 gigs of new music that I've yet to make available.  So again, any seeding help I can get (even if it's just for one or two of these albums today) would be sincerely appreciated.  That way we can all move onto some newer music.  Perhaps even albums that some of you have been anticipating.\n\nWe're now sitting at 1,864 shares for 2014.\n\nThe 23 titles to choose from today are...\n\n * Righteous Vendetta - 2014 - Defiance EP\n * Sarah Kelly - 2014 - My Corner Of Heaven\n * Sarah Michelle - 2014 - All Of Me EP\n * Scientist - 2014 - World EP - Mobile Lab Remix\n * Sea-H - 2014 - New Wine Skins\n * Selah - 2014 - Timeless - The Selah Collection\n * Selah The Corner - 2014 - Hoodie Season 2 - Black Dawn\n * Shauna Marie - 2014 - He Heals The Broken EP\n * Signature - 2014 - Bigger Than All\n * Speez - 2014 - Tomorrow May Be Too Late\n * Spencer Kane - 2014 - Runway\n * Stryper - 2014 - Live At The Whisky\n * Surrender, The - 2014 - God Is In Control\n * Switchfoot - 2014 - The Edge Of The Earth\n * Tasha Page-Lockhart - 2014 - Here Right Now\n * Texas In July - 2014 - Bloodwork\n * This Patch Of Sky - 2014 - This Patch Of Sky\n * Tim Neufeld - 2014 - The Joy - With The Glory Boys\n * Tim Sparks - 2014 - Chasin The Boogie\n * Tony Ward And Company - 2014 - The Basics\n * Trini - 2014 - Young And Beautiful\n * Urban Rescue - 2014 - Wildfire EP\n * Vince Lichlyter - 2014 - Helium Revisited EP\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts, October 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c7a945f7ce9e44a3587bc356b78caecdf837d4","amp;dn":"2014+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+55%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c7a945f7ce9e44a3587bc356b78caecdf837d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,199,169,69,247,206,158,68,163,88,123,195,86,183,140,174,205,248,55,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
