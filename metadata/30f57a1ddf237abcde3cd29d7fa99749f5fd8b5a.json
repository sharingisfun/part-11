Just as invested is newspaper reporter Jay Ganesh, looking for the one big story to repair his once-prestigious reputation. Both men soon discover, however, that the case is as difficult to navigate as MumbaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous traffic. From her cheating husband to the billionaire industrialist with whom she was Ã¢â‚¬Å“closeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; from her jealous colleague to the environmentalist protesting her company, Barton was not short on potential enemiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and nor are they short on lies. But the pressure is on for Gaikwad, the family man trying to do right on an often unscrupulous force, to place the blame on someone, anyone, and Jay is determined to be the first with the scoopÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how deadly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f57a1ddf237abcde3cd29d7fa99749f5fd8b5a","amp;dn":"Murder+in+Mumbai+-+K.+D.+Calamur.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f57a1ddf237abcde3cd29d7fa99749f5fd8b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,245,122,29,223,35,122,188,222,60,210,157,127,169,151,73,245,253,139,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
