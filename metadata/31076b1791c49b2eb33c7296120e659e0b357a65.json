It was assembled from seven lectures on audiotape by Hawking originally released in 1994 under the title, Stephen W. Hawking's Life Works: The Cambridge Lectures.[1] The book's title is in reference to the theory of everything, a physicists' jargon term for a theory in physics which unifies the four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, the strong force, the weak force, and the electromagnetic force.\n\nSeveral years ago Stephen Hawking said that there was a fifty-fifty chance that an actual unification of the four fundamental forces Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Theory of Everything Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would be achieved. Recently, however, he has become more pessimistic on this score.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31076b1791c49b2eb33c7296120e659e0b357a65","amp;dn":"Stephen+Hawking+-+Theory+of+Everything","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31076b1791c49b2eb33c7296120e659e0b357a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,7,107,23,145,196,155,46,179,60,114,150,18,14,101,158,11,53,122,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
