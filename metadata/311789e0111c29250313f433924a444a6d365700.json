Their biggest hit single, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, topped the UK and US Charts among others. They are one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time with worldwide sales of nearly 80 million albums, including 37.5 million albums in the United States alone.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgent Provocateur is the fifth studio album by American/British rock band Foreigner, released on November 5, 1984. The album was the band's first and only number one album in the UK, and it reached the top 5 in the U.S. Although album sales were lower than their previous work in the U.S., it contains the band's biggest hit single, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, which is their only #1 single in the UK and the U.S., staying at the top spot for three and two weeks respectively.
