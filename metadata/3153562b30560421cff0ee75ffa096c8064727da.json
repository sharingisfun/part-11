His love of his family is his anchor, and gives him the strength to confront evil in his work. One man knows this deeply, and uses Alex's strength as a weapon against him in the most unsettling and unexpected novel of James Patterson's career.\n\nWhen the ones Cross loves are in danger, he will do anything to protect them. If he does anything to protect them, they will die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3153562b30560421cff0ee75ffa096c8064727da","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-Cross+My+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3153562b30560421cff0ee75ffa096c8064727da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,83,86,43,48,86,4,33,207,240,238,117,255,160,150,200,6,71,39,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
