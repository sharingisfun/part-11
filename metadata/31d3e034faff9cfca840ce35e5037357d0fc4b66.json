Namely, the addition of an irritating wizard named Tonks to the cast of characters.\n\nHogwarts is taken over by the Ministry of Magic, who installs a puppet regime in the form of Dolores Umbridge. Because if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing kids love in their fantasy novels, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ham-fisted satire of totalitarian regimes! Will Harry master occulmency? Will he describe his first kiss simply as Ã¢â‚¬Å“wetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Will he severely overreact to the death of a character he had only really met a couple of times? Will Mike, Kevin and BIll imply that Dobby has taken up pimping as a way to earn extra cash? All these questions and more will be answered in the affirmative in this RiffTrax of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!\n\n*******************************************************************************\nThis movie is dual audio so it has two audio tracks: one with the Rifftrax commentary and the original.\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's fromto keep these coming!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d3e034faff9cfca840ce35e5037357d0fc4b66","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Harry+Potter+Order+of+the+Phoenix+-+dual+audio+.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d3e034faff9cfca840ce35e5037357d0fc4b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,211,224,52,250,255,156,252,168,64,206,53,229,3,115,87,208,252,75,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
