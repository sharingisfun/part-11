Drawing from all four of the Lightning Seeds' first albums, the collection hits all of the high points -- including &quot;Three Lions&quot; and a re-recorded &quot;Waiting for Today to Happen&quot; -- and adds two new songs, &quot;What You Say&quot; and &quot;Brain Drain,&quot; which are as engaging as the group's hit singles. In all, it's an ideal introduction for neophytes, and for longtime fans, it's a welcome reminder of Broudie's fine pop craftsmanship.
