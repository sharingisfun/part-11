Schumann is one of those composers that every conductor does, but that few do really well. Part of the problem stems from the monochrome orchestration. Szell makes minor adjustments for the sake of clarity, but otherwise leaves it up to his superb orchestra to achieve the proper balances. And despite the usual extraordinary discipline that he imposes on his players, he&amp;#039;s not afraid to let the music&amp;#039;s Romantic temper burst out now and again in a surge of energy. With excellently remastered sound, this set is certainly one for the record books. --David Hurwitz\n\nTrack Listing:\nCD1\n01 - Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major, Op. 38 &amp;#039;Spring&amp;#039; - I.
