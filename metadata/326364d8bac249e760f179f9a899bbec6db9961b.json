Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.\n\nThen, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.\n\nColton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326364d8bac249e760f179f9a899bbec6db9961b","amp;dn":"Jacinda+Wilder_Falling+Into+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326364d8bac249e760f179f9a899bbec6db9961b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,99,100,216,186,194,73,231,96,241,121,249,168,153,187,236,109,185,150,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
