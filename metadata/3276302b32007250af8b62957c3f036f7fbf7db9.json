Lift Heavy. Look the Part\n\nPublisher: Dragon Door Publications\nPavel Tsatsouline\n2012 \nEnglish\nISBN: 0938045857 \nEPUB\n227 pages \n15.5 MB\n\nHow to Develop the Ultimate in Wrought-Iron Muscle, Mid-Section Body Armor and Core Generation of Explosive PowerThe sole goal of Hardstyle Abs is to achieve an extraordinarily strong mid-section. But not simply to swivel heads with your rippling six-pack. For, according to Pavel, your abs should be simultaneously weapon, armor and force generator. The six-pack is just a side effect of the coiled power with which you now operate. \n\nHardstyle Abs will give you impenetrable body armor--to withstand a direct hit of the greatest magnitude. Hardstyle Abs will give you the generative force to retaliate with a devastating backlash. And Hardstyle Abs will help you lift more weight than ever before--more safely. After years of dedicated research and experimentation, Pavel has identified three killer drills, as all you need to achieve this level of mid-section mastery. Follow Pavel's battle plan to the T and the results are guaranteed--noticeable within weeks, extraordinary within months. Pavel provides the laser focus. You? Simply obey the commands. The highlights of Pavel's HardStyle Abs program:\n\nWhy high reps have failed you--and the secret sauce that will have your abs tuned for heavy action all day long and at a moment's notice.\n Hardstyle breathing--for explosive power and a bullet-proof waist.\n The Hardstyle Sit-up--to generate an unbelievable contraction for superior results.\n Internal Isometrics--the lost secret behind the old-time physical culturalists' exceptional abdominal strength and development.\n The Hardstyle Hanging Leg Raise--the final weapon you must master to channel the power of your every muscle into one devastating surge.\n My good friend Pavel is the functionally strongest pound for pound man I have ever measured and studied. This validates his approaches--they are not polluted by current trend, political correctness, financial gain or ego. Listen to his wisdom and you will be stronger and wiser. I did, and I am.--Professor Stuart McGill, author of Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3276302b32007250af8b62957c3f036f7fbf7db9","amp;dn":"Hardstyle+Abs+-+Hit+Hard.+Lift+Heavy.+Look+the+Part+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3276302b32007250af8b62957c3f036f7fbf7db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,118,48,43,50,0,114,80,175,139,98,149,124,63,3,111,127,191,125,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
