(Credited to Maceo Parker.) (AMG)\n\n\n\nFantastic album of hardcore funky cuts, with a great jazzy tip on the righteous solos laid down by Maceo and the band. Recorded in the time that Maceo was away from James' band, with a crack lineup of players including Melvin Parker, Jimmy Nolan, Bernard Odom, and L.D. Williams. \nNearly every cut is a lost funky gem, with funky bass, hard drums, and cool horn solos with a large sense of humor. Highlights include &quot;Southwick&quot;, &quot;Got to Get 'Cha&quot;, &quot;Maceo&quot;, and the fantastic &quot;Funky Women&quot;. This one was hard to find in the old days -- so grab it while you can\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/7880/foldertfc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/7880/foldertfc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
