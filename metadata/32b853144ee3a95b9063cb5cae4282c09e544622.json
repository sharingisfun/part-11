Explaining how to build and use neural networks, it presents complicated information about neural networks structure, functioning, and learning in a manner that is easy to understand.\n\nTaking a &quot;learn by doing&quot; approach, the book is filled with illustrations to guide you through the mystery of neural networks. Examples of experiments are provided in the text to encourage individual research. Online access to C# programs is also provided to help you discover the properties of neural networks.\n\nFollowing the procedures and using the programs included with the book will allow you to learn how to work with neural networks and evaluate your progress. You can download the programs as both executable applications and C# source code from http://home.agh.edu.pl/~tad//index.php?page=programy&amp;lang=en\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (September 2, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482233398\nISBN-13: 978-1482233391","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b853144ee3a95b9063cb5cae4282c09e544622","amp;dn":"%5BRyszard+Tadeusiewicz+%2CRituparna+Chaki+%2C+Nabendu+Chaki%5DExploring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b853144ee3a95b9063cb5cae4282c09e544622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,184,83,20,78,227,169,91,144,99,203,92,174,66,130,192,158,84,70,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
