He is probably the planet\\&amp;#039;s worst-suited person to run such an establishment: he makes no effort to sell, closes at strange hours on a whim, is in a perpetual alcoholic stupor, abhors his customers (sometimes physically abusing them) and is often comatose at his desk. Help comes in the lumpy shape of Manny Bianco, a hairy, bumbling individual who (almost by osmosis) becomes Bernard\\&amp;#039;s assistant. Manny is not exactly great at the job either but he is a million times better than Bernard. Next door is Fran, an anxious, frustrated woman who (in the first series) runs a sort of new-age shop selling the most unlikely bits of arty junk. (In the second, her shop was neither seen nor mentioned.) Fran is friends with Bernard and, through him, with Manny; together the trio become embroiled in escapades that are sometimes extreme or violent or fantastically ludicrous, and always bizarre. \n\nMicrosite:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/blackbooks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/blackbooks/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c82cd4b002fd813062670f3fb73f62f5182112","amp;dn":"Black+Books+-+Complete+Series+%5BDVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c82cd4b002fd813062670f3fb73f62f5182112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,200,44,212,176,2,253,129,48,98,103,15,63,183,63,98,245,24,33,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
