Each volume features one or two sides of instrumental music from a different Soviet Socialist Republic. The recordings feature performances by both amateurs and professionals, mostly instrumental but with some vocal tracks. \n\nThe recordings are in most cases of the highest quality: rich, detailed, clean, with nice tonal balance. The LP pressings are quite good, with minimal pressing noise and essentially no tracking distortion. Each LP includes a booklet with brief descriptions of each track, descriptions of the instruments, and pictures of some of the instruments. \n\nVolume 9 has instrumental music from the northern part of the Caucasus Mountains on side A and instrumental music from the region of the Volga River and Ural Mountains on side B. The high points for me are the Mari zither performances on side B. There is also a track on side A featuring a pair of duduks, and some lovely recordings of accordions from that area.\n\nMy LP copy is in excellent condition. It was transcribed to tagged 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files, using an analog rig that is near state-of-the-art. I used the mildest possible de-clicking but otherwise no noise reduction. The torrent includes a PDF file with scans of the notes in English and pictures of instruments in the booklet. \n\nI own 7 of 10 volumes of this set. I've already transcribed two others, and will be transcribing at least one more soon. \n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: Linn Akiva phono cartridge, Linn LP12/Lingo turntable, Linn Ekos SE tonearm, Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable, PS Audio PS2 preamplifier, Kimber PBJ interconnect, M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter.\n\nNorth Caucasus Instrumental Music\n\n01 - Kabardin music [2:51]\n02 - Khessake Iored [1:49]\n03 - Bachtchylyk [1:57]\n04 - Dance on Tip-Toe [1:19]\n05 - Avar-Lezgue music [6:10]\n06 - Kalmuk music [3:40]\n07 - On the Mountain Paths [1:25]\n08 - Chaban Song [2:46]\n\nVolga-Ural Instrumental Music\n\n01 - Mari Melodies [3:45]\n02 - Mari Songs [6:30]\n03 - Chuvash Music [4:27]\n04 - Tartar melody [1:32]\n05 - Bashkir melodies [3:23]\n\nNOTE: To the best of my knowledge, these recordings are not currently available commercially. If you know otherwise, please let me know ASAP, as I do not wish any artists to be deprived of the royalties that they so richly deserve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32dd2a3107f57792ab526b941e8dbe68f1ee94e5","amp;dn":"Voyage+en+URSS+%28USSR%29+9+-+North+Caucasus%2C+Volga%2C+Ural+%28FLAC24%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32dd2a3107f57792ab526b941e8dbe68f1ee94e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,221,42,49,7,245,119,146,171,82,107,148,30,141,190,104,241,238,148,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
