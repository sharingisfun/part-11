In this course, Bill Weinman dissects the anatomy of C and C++, from variables to functions and loops, and explores both the C Standard Library and the C++ Standard Template Library. Features introduced in the C++11 standard (ratified in 2011) are also discussed.\n\nThis course serves both as an end-to-end tutorial for those new to the language and a solid reference for experienced C/C++ programmers.\n\nTopics include:\n\n* Setting up a development environment on Mac, Windows, or Linux\n* Understanding the development cycle\n* Writing statements and expressions\n* Declaring variables and functions\n* Working with arrays and strings\n* Comparing with conditionals\n* Including files and executing macros with the C preprocessor\n* Working with different data types\n* Using operators to perform basic arithmetic and more complicated functions\n* Understanding inheritance\n* C++ template programming\n* Handling system errors and exceptions\n* Using C++ STL containers\n* Using C++11 type inference, Lambda functions, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f2bca931b3a23c2754f8315a8819cdd6248c50","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+C%26amp%3BC%2B%2B+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f2bca931b3a23c2754f8315a8819cdd6248c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,242,188,169,49,179,162,60,39,84,248,49,90,136,25,205,214,36,140,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
