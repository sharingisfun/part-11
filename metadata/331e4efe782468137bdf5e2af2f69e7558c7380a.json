He's best known to-day for the films he made for Hammer (The Plague of the Zombies, The Reptile) but the more I see of his work, the better he looks. The Challenge (aka It Takes a Thief) is a pretty good place to start, not least because it augments the typically strong plotting and punchy direction with the thoroughly anachronistic presence of Hollywood siren Jayne Mansfield.\n\nJayne Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe's blond competition in the late '50s and early '60s, stars in this crime melodrama as Billy, the leader of a gang of thieves. She charms Jim (Anthony Quayle), a widower with a young daughter, into joining the group effort on a particular robbery. After the heist, Jim personally stashes away their stolen loot while she leads the police off in another direction.\n\nBut the unfortunate new recruit ends up in the clinker for five years while the others go free. Once out of jail, Jim is brought up short -- Billy has allied herself with another man and her gang has money to spare -- though not enough money, they decide. Against Billy's wishes, the gang takes drastic measures to get at Jim's hidden cache of loot from the robbery that sent him to jail.\n\nAnthony Quayle,another familiar British face,who was an acclaimed WW2 spy. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 737mb\nDuration.... 01:31:07\nCodec.......
