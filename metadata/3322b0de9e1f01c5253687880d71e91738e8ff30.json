As Hitler believed, the wars \nof the twentieth century are not fought on the battlefield, but in the minds\nof the people. This is more true today than it ever has been in the past.\n\nThis compilation deals specifically with the historical evidence and programs\nused in the government mind control program known as MK-Ultra. It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s technology \nis often psychological and electronic means of producing of the kind of trauma \nused to brainwash and covertly manipulate unsuspecting human beings. This practice\nfirst began in Nazi Germany, as Hitler sought the ultimate weapon of domination\nfor the Third Reich. His pursuits included the use of highly devleoped propaganda,\nthe creation of the youth movement, multi-generational incestuous families, and the\ntorture of jewish children and social outcasts who were used as test subjects\nin medical experiments conducted at Dashau by Dr Josef Mengele.\n\nBut the atrocities did not end with the Nuremberg trials and the so-called defeat\nof the nazi regime. Under project paperclip, hundreds of Hitlers \\\\\\&quot;Mind Scientists\\\\\\&quot;\nwere covertly relocated into the USA national security establishment and top Ivy \nLeague universities. In addition, Hitlers own spymaster and head of intelligence, \nReinhard Gehlen, was made the head of the US intelligence gathering organization\nset up after world war II, and was instrumental in the creation of the National \nSecurity Act of 1947, giving birth to the CIA and the \\\\\\&quot;Invisible Government\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nSince its inception, the national security state has sought, as Hitler did, to \nachieve the ultimate weapon in world domination and military supremacy. During \nthe cold war era, military intelligence, covert warfare and black operations \nbecame the new rules of engagement, and just as common law and ethics were \nsubverted under Nazism, so were laws and morality of US government under the\nnational security act and intelligence establishment. The US government began to \nconduct and resurrect everything Hitler had discovered in his goal of creating\nthe ultimate technology of military and mental control.\n\nThe details and research involved in this subject can be quite traumatizing to\nthose seeking an understanding of what Mind Control involves. The MK-Ultra program\nwas first exposed through the freedom of information act. Since then, a \noverwhelming amount of documentation, witness testimony, and political scandals \nhave surfaced and brought much of this dark subject to light. This DVD attempts to \ntrace the development of the MK-Ultra program, its use over the last 50 years,\nand the future of government mind control.\n\n\n\nDocument Archives:\n------------------------\n\nCKLN-FM Mind Control Series\nDr. Ewen Cameron\nFritz Springmeier\nJon Rappoport\nJohnny Gosch\nMindnet Journals\nProject Paperclip\nSatanic Ritual Abuse\nThe Bohemian Grove\nThe Montauk Project\nWalter Bowart\n\n1977 Senate Hearing on MKULTRA.pdf\nBiography -
