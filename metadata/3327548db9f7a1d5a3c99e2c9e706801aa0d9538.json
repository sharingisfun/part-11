This book  surveys alternative  number systems:  systems\nthat generalise the real numbers yet stay close to the properties that\nmake the reals central to mathematics.\n\nThere are  many alternative  number systems, such  as multidimensional\nnumbers   (complex  numbers,   quarternions),  infinitely   small  and\ninfinitely  large   numbers  (hyperreal  numbers)  and   numbers  that\nrepresent  positions in  games (surreal  numbers).\n\nEach system  has a  well-developed theory  with applications  in other\nareas of mathematics and science. They  all feature in active areas of\nresearch and each has unique features that are explored in this book.\n\nAlternative number systems reveal the central role of the real numbers\nand motivate some exciting and eccentric areas of mathematics.\n\nWhat Numbers Are Real? will be an illuminating read for anyone with an\ninterest  in numbers,  but specifically  for advanced  undergraduates,\ngraduate students and teachers of university-level mathematics.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=0883857774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=0883857774&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3327548db9f7a1d5a3c99e2c9e706801aa0d9538","amp;dn":"Which+Numbers+Are+Real%3F+-+Michael+Henle.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3327548db9f7a1d5a3c99e2c9e706801aa0d9538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,39,84,141,185,247,161,213,163,201,158,44,158,112,104,1,170,13,149,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
