Full Descriptionsalad, as the D.M.B. reports in with even more creative eclecticism than usual. Guest appearances by artists as varied as Alanis Morissette, Bela Fleck and Kronos Quartet are a testament to the collage of sounds present. Occasional ventures into Middle Eastern melodicism feel as natural a part of the band's sound as do its mellow folk grooves and funky rhythm flights. The lyrics are a glad swirl of pop storytelling and trippy mystery, brought to life by the usual confluence of saxophones, violin and precise guitar work that makes this group tick. \n\nOver a fat backbeat, Matthews carries the clever, sultry lyrics of &quot;Rapunzel&quot; with a whimsical vocal blend of growls and falsetto jumps, culminating in a soprano rhapsody by hornman Leroi Moore. The funk-vamp &quot;Stay&quot; makes you want to do just that, featuring a joyous gospel chorus and peppery, staccato horn lines. Excellent, frenetic bowing by Kronos Quartet couples with Matthews' quick picking to drive &quot;The Stone&quot; to a 6/8 fury, only to be resolved with delicate grace. Morisette's lilt and Fleck's colorful banjo wrap this excellent album up tastefully on &quot;Spoon.&quot; \n\nRecorded at the Record Plant, Sausalito, California and Electric Lady Studios, New York, New York. \n\nKronos Quartet: David Harrington, John Sherba (violin); Hank Dutt (viola); Joan Jeanrenaud (cello). \n\nPersonnel: Dave Matthews (vocals, acoustic guitar); Alanis Morissette (vocals); Tim Reynolds (electric guitar, mandolin); BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck (banjo); David Harrington, John Sherba, Boyd Tinsley (violin); Hank Dutt (viola); Joan Jeanrenaud (cello); LeRoi Moore (pennywhistle, bass clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone); John D'earth (trumpet); Butch Taylor (piano, organ); Greg Howard (Chapman stick); Carter Beauford (drums, percussion, background vocals); Brenda White-King, Cindy Myzelle, Tawatha Agee (background vocals). \n\nAudio Mixer: Steve Lillywhite. \n\nRecording information: Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY; Plant Recording Studio, Sausalito, CA. \n\nEnsemble: Kronos Quartet. \n\nudp://tracker.prq.to:80/announce \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.bittorrent.am/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.bittorrent.am/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33811cce606eb6ba485d3662020c0a116d4b73d7","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+-+Before+These+Crowded+Streets+%28EAC+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33811cce606eb6ba485d3662020c0a116d4b73d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,129,28,206,96,110,182,186,72,93,54,98,2,12,10,17,109,75,115,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
