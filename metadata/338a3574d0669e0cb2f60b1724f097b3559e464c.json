M. Jacobs VINE VOICE\nHow could I have been the first person to review this album? Unbelievable... but then that's the state of music these days.\n\nI own about 12 Nitty Gritty Dirt Band albums and this is easily one of my favorite ones. It has a &quot;comfortable pair of shoes&quot; quality to it, and for some reason I keep coming back for another listen. It's all acoustic instruments on this one, so it has an old timey, hoedown sort of feel. The lack of amplification seems to allow the music to soak in. It has that intimate feel that good country music has to it.\n\nI've seen these guys four times &quot;live&quot; and this disc is almost as good. Well, not quite, but pretty dang good anyway. That feeling of &quot;we just love to play&quot; is all over each song chosen here.\n\nIf you're looking to round out your Dirt Band collection or if you're a first time sampler of these boys, it would be tough to improve on a purchase of this disc.\n\nP.S. When the remastered version came out, I snapped it up like a duck on a Junebug. Fabulous tone and sound quality from some First Rate pickin' and singin'.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band - Acoustic\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\nAlbum................: Acoustic\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 269kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
