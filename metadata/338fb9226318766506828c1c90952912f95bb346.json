In 2001 he met his tragic end on the track. ESPN made a biographical TV movie about Dale Earnhardt's life and this is it.\n\nI've been looking for this movie all over the place. Finding crappy quality ones, or cropped shitty aspect ratio versions. I finally decided to search on eMule. I barely found this copy with a whole 2 people sharing it. It took me forever to download. This is the best copy of this movie I have yet to find. It needs to be shared throughout the torrenting world.\n\nMovie Info:\n\nDuration: 1hr 32min 02sec\n\n\nAudio:\n\nBitrate: 128kbps VBR\nCompression: MPEG Layer-3\n\n\nVideo:\n\nFrame Rate: 23.976fps\nCompression: XviD\nAspect Ratio: 1.78\nResolution: 576x320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338fb9226318766506828c1c90952912f95bb346","amp;dn":"Number.3.The.Dale.Earnhardt.Story.STV.2004.DVDRip.XViD-FiCO.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338fb9226318766506828c1c90952912f95bb346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,143,185,34,99,24,118,101,6,130,140,28,144,149,41,18,249,91,179,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
