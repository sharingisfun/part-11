She faces a much higher risk for burnout, infidelity, and divorce. In this highly practical book, financial guru and media star Farnoosh TorabiÃ¢â‚¬â€a breadwinner herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€presents a bold strategy that not only addresses how income imbalances affect relationships and family dynamics, but also how a woman can best manage (and take advantage of) this unique circumstanceÃ¢â‚¬â€emotionally, socially, and financially.\n\nAmong the rules:\n\nRewrite the Fairy Tale: Come to grips with the new landscape for dating, marriage, and ever after.\nFind Your Favorite Position: Stay on top of the finances while allowing your partner to lead.\n\nDon't Settle for a Mr. Mom: The math may conclude it's best for him to quit his job to become the primary caregiver, but there's far more to consider.\n\nDon't Make His Life Too Easy: \n\nHow outsourcing and paying for help can backfire.\nWith eye-opening stories and a survey of one thousand people, this book will appeal to fans of The End of Men and The Richer Sex. Torabi helps us embrace this new reality and make it work.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339574116e53e9678e24ec6ad1f462c5671a3d6f","amp;dn":"When+She+Makes+More%3A+10+Rules+for+Breadwinning+Women","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339574116e53e9678e24ec6ad1f462c5671a3d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,149,116,17,110,83,233,103,142,36,236,106,209,244,98,197,103,26,61,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
