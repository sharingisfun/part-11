The names of the islands are different depending on who you talk to, their very locations seem to twist and shift. Some islands have been sculpted into vast musical instruments, others are home to lethal creatures, others the playground for high society. Hot winds blow across the archipelago and a war fought between two distant continents is played out across its waters.\n\nThe Islanders serves both as an untrustworthy but enticing guide to the islands; an intriguing, multi-layered tale of a murder; and the suspect legacy of its appealing but definitely untrustworthy narrator.\n\n&quot;The Islanders is a bit of a puzzle of a novel containing a narrative that must be pieced together. The book is presented as a travel guide to the Dream Archipelago, a vast array of islands located in a massive sea on an alien planet. Each chapter focuses on a different island, and many entries make subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) hints to the drama that has overtaken a few of the islandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ residents. A tale of love, murder and artistic rivalry, The Islanders is a very human story set in a very alien world. A read so addictive that upon finishing I immediately started it again, anxious to see what clues I could find the second time around.&quot;\n\n\n\nRead by Michael Maloney\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33c76f8c7ab3eb3199ca1f56983ab4a2ce8b1f44","amp;dn":"Christopher+Priest+-+The+Islanders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33c76f8c7ab3eb3199ca1f56983ab4a2ce8b1f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,199,111,140,122,179,235,49,153,202,31,86,152,58,180,162,206,139,31,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
