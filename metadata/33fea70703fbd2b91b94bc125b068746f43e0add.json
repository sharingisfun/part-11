In other words, it's a modern-day Transport Tycoon with procedural content and a sophisticated city simulation.\n\n&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the year 1850, and there are great times ahead! Establish a transport company and be its manager. Build infrastructure such as railways and stations, purchase transportation vehicles and manage lines. Fulfill the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs and watch cities evolve dynamically.\n\nTrain Fever runs on an engine specifically developed for this game. The engine has a great innovative scope and is specialized in procedural content and urban simulation. A key point is the fact that there is no grid that game objects have to be aligned to, allowing for a great degree of freedom.\nFeatures\n\n   -Randomly generated, modifiable terrain with realistic dimensions\n   -Advanced passenger simulation\n   -Dynamically simulated urban development\n   -Procedurally generated buildings\n   -No grid - that is, the game world is not limited to 90 (or 45) degree angles\n   -Vehicles from more than 150 years of transportation history\n   -Passenger and freight transport\n   -Achievements and experience points\n   -Detailed 3D graphics\n   -Freely adjustable zoom factor\n\n\nWindows:\n    Minimum:\n        OS: Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8\n        Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo\n        Memory: 2 GB RAM\n        Graphics: Nvidia GeForce 8800 512 MB, ATI Radeon HD 3850 512 MB\n        Additional Notes: Mouse with wheel \n\nMAC OS X:\n    Minimum:\n        OS: OS X 10.7.5 or higher (64-bit)\n        Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo\n        Memory: 2 GB RAM\n        Graphics: Nvidia GeForce 8800 512 MB, ATI Radeon HD 3850 512 MB \n\nSteamOS+Linux:\n    Minimum:\n        OS: Ubuntu 12.10 or higher (64-bit)\n        Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo\n        Memory: 2 GB RAM\n        Graphics: Nvidia GeForce 8800 512 MB, ATI Radeon HD 3850 512 MB\n        Additional Notes: OpenGL 3.2 core profile \n\n\n1.Unrar\n2.Start the game with TrainFever.exe\n\nSorry guys i forgot my saved game in the game delete it:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33fea70703fbd2b91b94bc125b068746f43e0add","amp;dn":"Train+Fever+Build+5112-+Repack+by+Punkbuster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33fea70703fbd2b91b94bc125b068746f43e0add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,254,167,7,3,251,210,185,27,148,188,18,91,6,135,70,244,62,10,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
