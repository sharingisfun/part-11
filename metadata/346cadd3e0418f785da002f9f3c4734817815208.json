They consist of three sonatas da chiesa, in four movements, and three partitas, in dance-form movements.\n\nThe set was completed by 1720, but was only published in 1802 by Nicolaus Simrock in Bonn. Even after publication, it was largely ignored until the celebrated violinist Josef Joachim started performing these works. Today, Bach's Sonatas and Partitas are an essential part of the violin repertoire, and they are frequently performed and recorded.\n\nThe Sei Solo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a violino senza Basso accompagnato, as Bach titled them, firmly established the technical capability of the violin as a solo instrument. The pieces often served as an archetype for solo violin pieces for the following generations of composers including EugÃƒÂ¨ne YsaÃƒÂ¿e and BÃƒÂ©la BartÃƒÂ³k.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nFLAC'ed using EAC, enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:346cadd3e0418f785da002f9f3c4734817815208","amp;dn":"Sonatas+and+Partitas+J.S.+Bach+by+Yehudi+Menuhin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"346cadd3e0418f785da002f9f3c4734817815208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,108,173,211,224,65,143,120,93,160,2,249,243,196,115,72,23,129,82,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
