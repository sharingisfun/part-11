With his group, Wilder combines the surf guitar of the Ventures with the rock roots of Duane Eddy, drawing on the feel of both country music and film noir. Though sometimes bordering on the gimmicky, the band is quite humorous yet plays serious music. It Came from Nashville featured a cover of Steve Earle's &quot;Devil's Right Hand,&quot; appropriate because, like Earle, Wilder rocked too hard to be country but kept a twang that might put off mainstream rock fans. Wilder's next two albums didn't necessarily forge new ground but refined the band's sound somewhat, making its R&amp;B influence more apparent. In concert, Wilder often gives stream-of-consciousness recitations that touch on motor homes, voodoo, television, and other somewhat kitschy subjects; usually they're funny enough to work. An example of his live show, Born to Be Wilder, appeared in 2008 from Blind Pig Records. More Like Me followed in 2009, again from the Blind Pig label.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWebb Wilder: vocals, guitar \nDonnie &quot;The Twangler&quot; Roberts: guitar, vocals \nDenny &quot;Cletus&quot; Blakely: bass guitar, vocals \nJimmy Lester: drums \nThe Ionizer: drums, guitar, vocals \n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1 How Long Can She Last\n(Going That Fast) \n2 Horror Hayride \n3 I'm Burning \n4 Is This All There Is? \n5 Devil's Right Hand \n6 Move On Down The Line \n7 One Taste Of The Bait \n8 I'm Wise To You \n9 It Gets In Your Blood \n10 Poolside \n11 Ruff Rider \n12 Keep It On Your Mind \n13 Rock 'n Roll Ruby \n14 Samson &amp; Delilah's Beauty Shop \n15 Cactus Planet \n16 Dance For Daddy \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34754c218a7bac5289c3ef2ecdf7de6765b54db1","amp;dn":"Webb+Wilder+-+It+Came+From+Nashville++%5B1986%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34754c218a7bac5289c3ef2ecdf7de6765b54db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,117,76,33,138,123,172,82,137,195,239,46,205,247,222,103,101,181,77,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
