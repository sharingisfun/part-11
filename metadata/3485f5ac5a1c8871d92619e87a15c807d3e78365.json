The pianist&amp;#039;s works tend to fall into two categories: contemplative contemporary instrumental and classically influenced compositions. The latter is where he shines, as represented best by the sentimental stylings of &quot;Cristofori&amp;#039;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Return to the Heart,&quot; and the effervescent energy of &quot;Vesuvius&quot; and &quot;Valencia.&quot; Most of these 27 tracks are solo piano performances. However, the soaring &quot;Eagle&amp;#039;s Path&quot; (with Paul Speer) integrates rock guitar, and a few other pieces include orchestral instruments. This isn&amp;#039;t a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, but the double-disc compendium is a good way for longtime fans to get lesser-known tracks and sample albums they are unfamiliar with. More important, it&amp;#039;s a means for the uninitiated to learn about, and then seek out, other Lanz music of their choosing\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc: 1      \n1. Valencia  \n2.
