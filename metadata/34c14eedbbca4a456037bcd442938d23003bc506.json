What unites them generally is SK's high level of quality, and specifically, Jazzanova's unequaled ear for what sounds great in a mix of '80s-influenced R&amp;B and post-disco. Virtually all of the mix is free-form, mostly vocal-led, and a mixture of organic or electronics on the rhythm end Ã¢â‚¬â€ waves of synths are as common as acoustic guitar picking. It's a tribute to Jazzanova's talents that, in this context, Sonar Kollektiv releases sound even better than they do individually, led by one chestnut that actually did source from the '80s: &quot;I Just Wanna Sing for You&quot; by Norman Weeks &amp; the Revelations.\n\n\n\n\n\n1     Candlelight                                                    \t       4:14\n2     Or At Least                                                              3:34\n3     Intermission                                                             0:12\n4     Excelsior \t  \t                                               6:21\n5     Flashback (Jazzanova's Mashed Bag) \t                               3:32\n6     Skitsophrenic, Pt. 2 \t                                               0:31\n7     In The (Re)mix [Starship Interpretation] \t                               4:11\n8     I Just Wanna Sing For You \t                                       2:51\n9     No Memory Of Time (Reggae Version) \t                               5:08\n10    Clapz (Trickski Mix) \t    \t                                       1:36\n11    AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Nothing Like This Feeling (Charles Webster's Slightly Slower Mix)  3:41\n12    Boom Clicky Boom Klack (Mr.Scuff's Vocal Mix) \t                       4:59\n13    Nowhere (I Can Go) [Atjazz' Astro Black Mix] \t                       5:07\n14    My Vision (Dixon Edit) \t                                               6:08\n15    Serve It Up (Starship Remix) \t                                       3:50\n16    Sun Of A Beach (London Mix) \t                                       3:42\n17    Beatzeps \t                                                               2:57\n18    Step Off \t                                                               4:17\n19    So Long \t                                                               4:05\n20    Just A Lil' Lovin (Just A Lil' Outro) \t                               2:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenres: Electronic, Music,\nDance, Easy Listening, Bop\nReleased: Jun 26, 2006\n2006 Sonar Kollektiv\n\n\nBit Rate: Variable, up to 320 KBps\nFormat:   M4A - untouched\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\nRippin Kittin\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c14eedbbca4a456037bcd442938d23003bc506","amp;dn":"Jazzanova+-+%5B2006%5D+-+...Broad+Casting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c14eedbbca4a456037bcd442938d23003bc506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,193,78,237,187,202,74,69,96,55,188,212,66,147,141,35,0,59,197,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
