I was very inspired by the book and less by the film, but it was interesting to see all the exotic places described by Redfield.\n\nThis is not my rip, I found it on the net using PirateBay's tracker, so I thought it should be represented here. Alas, the French soundtrack and subs have been deleted from this copy, but the English subs may be handy because some Spanish is spoken.\n\nTip: Press 'Menu' to escape trailer at beginning.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d2bc0b789180f82660356878eb99c7ace608f3","amp;dn":"The+Celestine+Prophecy+%282006%29+Full+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d2bc0b789180f82660356878eb99c7ace608f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,210,188,11,120,145,128,248,38,96,53,104,120,235,153,199,172,230,8,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
