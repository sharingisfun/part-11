Paul Getty | 1997 | ISBN: 0892364386 | Multilingual | PDF | 128 pages | 35.91 Mb\nEnglish/German/French/Italian/Spanish/Japanese\n\nThe collection of European drawings in the J. Paul Getty Museum, built up over a decade and a half, has increased steadily in both breadth and depth. While the holdings of drawings from the Italian Renaissance are particularly strongÃ¢â‚¬â€including for instance, a double-sided sheet by Leonardo da VinciÃ¢â‚¬â€other schools, the French, in particular, are also well represented. The collectionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emphasis is on major draftsmen, such as David, DÃƒÂ¼rer, Gainsborough, Goya, Ingres, Piranesi, Poussin, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens, Tintoretto, Titian, Veronese, and Watteau, while the occasional acquisition of groups of drawings has added strength in certain areas, such as the German and Swiss Renaissance. Organized by national school, with artists represented chronologically within each, this volume focuses on the most important drawings in the collection, which admirably illustrate the development of European drawing from the Renaissance onward.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f5aefc7f5fc8db84127cdf054b9a5f3f181b7d","amp;dn":"Masterpieces+of+the+Getty+Museum+-++Drawings+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f5aefc7f5fc8db84127cdf054b9a5f3f181b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,245,174,252,127,95,200,219,132,18,124,223,5,75,154,95,63,24,27,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
