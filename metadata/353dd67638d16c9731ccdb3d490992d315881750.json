In these proceedings, international scientists and engineers present recent technical progress on materials-related aspects of fuel cells including SOFC component materials, materials processing, and cell/stack design, performance, and stability. Emerging trends in electrochemical materials, electrodics, interface engineering, long-term chemical interactions, and more are included.\n\nThis book is compiled of papers presented at the Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Advanced Ceramics and Composites, January 22-27, 2006, Cocoa Beach, Florida. Organized and sponsored by The American Ceramic Society and The American Ceramic Society's Engineering Ceramics Division in conjunction with the Nuclear and Environmental Technology Division","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:353dd67638d16c9731ccdb3d490992d315881750","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Solid+Oxide+Fuel+Cells+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"353dd67638d16c9731ccdb3d490992d315881750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,61,214,118,56,209,108,151,49,204,219,61,73,9,146,211,21,136,23,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
