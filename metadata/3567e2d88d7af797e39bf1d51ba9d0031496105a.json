Despite the odd looks, life is good. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean and sober, dotes on her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kids and, best of all, spends most of her free time with her best buddy, Colt McKay. Reformed bad boy Colt never expected three years of sobriety to lead to three years of abstinence. Curbing his craving for booze and random sexual encounters, however, is nothing compared to the ever-increasing craving for his hot-tempered, hot-bodied best friend, India. Too bad sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his A.A. sponsor. Too bad she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a clue that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been head-over-bootheels in love with her from day one. After an unexpected, steamy interlude, all India can think about is riding the sexy cowboy instead of her motorcycle. Or are they risking their friendship for a fling that could burn them both?
