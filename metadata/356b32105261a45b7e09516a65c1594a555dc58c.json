You will also want to\nallow setup to download updates during upgrade process.\n-I tried every damn thing I could think of to not have to change the\ndefault boot options. It simply will not correctly extract ESD files all\nthe time using the Windows Setup.exe program. I believe it has something\nto do with the way that esd compressed files are being handled in the\nextraction portion of setup. I believe they are not properly waiting until\nall the extraction threads are finished to proceed with the image mods that\nthey do around the 88-95 percentish range.\n\nComments:\n-ESD lifecycle has reached it's end for pre-activated monthly versions\nusing the default Windows Setup program (boot setup). To get around this\nissue, I've integrated my setup script from my diskpart/apply project.\nYou can still try to use Windows Setup by closing the script or selecting\nthe No option at the opening of the script.\n\n-Previous v1 release had an issue with the recenv call in winre.wim. As a\nresult it will simply reboot when you try to use it. Most people will never\nsee this issue since most of the recenv is integrated into windows itself.\nHowever, to fix, you do the following:\n\n-run admin prompt command:\ndiskpart\nselect disk 0\nlist partition (find the one with 300mb)\nselect partition 3 (or whatever the number of your 300mb one is)\nassign\nexit\n\n(use backslashes not forward slashes in directory locations for rest)\n-Then turn on system file viewing in your control panel.\ncopy/paste the winre.wim file from the recovery partition recovery/windowsre\ndirectory.\n-mount the winre.wim index 1 using dism:\ndism /mount-wim /wimfile:c:/temp/winre.wim /index:1 /mountdir:c:/mount\n-edit the c:/mount/windows/system32/winpeshl.ini file\n-Change the line:\n%systemdrive%/recovery/recenv.exe\nTo:\n%systemdrive%/sources/recovery/recenv.exe\n-Then unmount /commit and copy/paste over old file.\ndism /unmount-wim /mountdir:c:/mount /commit\n-copy/paste it over the old one from recovery/windowsre in the 300mb\nrecovery partition. (Make sure you didn't use forward slashes)\n\nmurphy78 Setup Script features:\n-Multi-Boot, Fast Setup, Add drivers to PE environment, Add drivers to\npost-install offline image, Recovery image partition, Fully ESD compatible,\nsplit-wim compatible, No Extra system partition option for MBR users.\n-You can even shrink your recovery image after install and resize your\npartitions, though I haven't automated that part. You would just assign\na drive letter to the recovery partition, copy/paste the install.wim to your\nsystem drive and export the image to an install.esd using recovery compress.\nThen you point reagentc at the osimage again.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - AutoKMS Activator from MTK 2.5.1\nmurphy78 - Testing, ISO design[/b]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/7Pjsf3K.png[/img]\n\n[b]Join &quot;Team OS&quot; On Facebook To Get Latest Software/To Clear Your Doubts Etc .....[/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356b32105261a45b7e09516a65c1594a555dc58c","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+20in1+with+Update+x64+en-US+Apr2014+v2+%28By+murph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356b32105261a45b7e09516a65c1594a555dc58c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,107,50,16,82,97,164,91,126,9,81,106,101,193,89,74,85,93,197,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
