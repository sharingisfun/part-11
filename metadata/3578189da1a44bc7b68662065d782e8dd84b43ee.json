With the goal of uniting the key stakeholders (contractors, architects, engineers, etc) and providing them with a workable system for operating as an effective construction team, Construction Project Administration reflects the latest technology, laws and regulations. Topics pertinent to each stage of a project are introduced and discussed as they occur throughout the life of the project. Numerous real-world examples are included.\n\n \n\nThis edition includes coverage of BIM, the introduction of the 2004 version of CSI MasterformatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ and a complete chapter on electronic project administration. By tracing a construction project from start to finish, Construction Project Administration offers a single source of information for all in the construction industry.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 648 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 9 edition (July 24, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0135000076\n# ISBN-13: 978-0135000076\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3578189da1a44bc7b68662065d782e8dd84b43ee","amp;dn":"Construction+Project+Administration%2C+9th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3578189da1a44bc7b68662065d782e8dd84b43ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,120,24,157,161,164,75,199,182,134,98,6,93,120,46,141,216,75,67,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
