Fukumura et al. (Wiley-VCH, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nFrom artificial surfaces to living cells, Molecular Nano Dynamics, Vol. I and Vol. II explores more than 40 important methods for dynamic observation of the nanoscale. Edited by absolute science greats from Japan, this two-volume set covers all important aspects of this topic: nanoscale spectroscopy and characterization tools, nanostructure dynamics, single living cell dynamics, active surfaces, and single crystals. Destined to be the definitive reference work on nanoscale molecular dynamics and their observation for years to come, this is a must-have reference for chemists, physicists, physical chemists, theoretical chemists, and materials scientists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357f3fdd0d9377ba4770e51e96bbd9abfd28e8a0","amp;dn":"Molecular+Nano+Dynamics+-+H.+Fukumura+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357f3fdd0d9377ba4770e51e96bbd9abfd28e8a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,127,63,221,13,147,119,186,71,112,229,30,150,187,217,171,253,40,232,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
