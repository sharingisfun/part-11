The Real Garden of Eden.\nCan we find the Garden of Eden? Bible scholar Dr Francesca Stavrakopoulou thinks so. In the final episode of her series re-examining conventional readings of the Bible, she argues that the Garden of Eden has nothing to do with the origins of humanity, but is rather a story concealing dramatic events about a particular figure in a particular place, two and half thousand years ago. Marshalling compelling evidence from archaeology, Islam and the Bible text itself, she identifies and visits the exact site of Eden. It's a revolutionary theory which challenges some of the most cherished preconceptions about Eden in both Christianity and western culture.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zp3j3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zp3j3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSource: HDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a5c0070eb96864f04cac9f01a8aca5d4a139e9","amp;dn":"BBC+Bibles+Buried+Secrets+3of3+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a5c0070eb96864f04cac9f01a8aca5d4a139e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,165,192,7,14,185,104,100,240,76,172,159,1,168,172,165,212,161,57,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
