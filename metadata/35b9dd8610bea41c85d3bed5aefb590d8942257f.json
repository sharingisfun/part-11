Introducing children to the beauty and wonder of the subject through hands-on activities, this guide demonstrates how to construct a geodesic dome big enough for a person to sit in, solve the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardest two-piece puzzle, pass a straight line through a curved slot, and amaze others with the mysterious Mobius strip. Emphasizing how mathematics can be encountered in daily life, this intriguing reference highlights the hidden patterns in snowflakes, soap bubbles, and even the graceful curves of the Golden Gate Bridge. Touching on number patterns, lines, curves, and shapes, each activity includes engaging facts, vocabulary builders, and connections to other topics. With a companion website featuring video instructions for several projects as well as additional activities, this educational exploration turns the art of numbers into an adventure for all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b9dd8610bea41c85d3bed5aefb590d8942257f","amp;dn":"Amazing+Math+Projects+You+Can+Build+Yourself+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b9dd8610bea41c85d3bed5aefb590d8942257f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,185,221,134,16,190,164,28,133,211,190,213,174,251,89,13,137,66,37,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
