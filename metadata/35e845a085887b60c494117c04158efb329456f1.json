Unlike other download accelerators and managers that segment files before downloading starts, Internet Download Manager segments downloaded files dynamically during download process.\n\nInternet Download Manager reuses available connections without additional connect and login stages to achieve better acceleration performance. Internet Download Manager supports proxy servers, ftp and http protocols, firewalls, redirects, cookies, authorization, MP3 audio and MPEG video content processing. IDM integrates seamlessly into Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape, MSN Explorer, AOL, Opera, Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Firebird, Avant Browser, MyIE2, and all other popular browsers to automatically handle your downloads. You can also drag and drop files, or use Internet Download Manager from command line. Internet Download Manager can dial your modem at the set time, download the files you want, then hang up or even shut down your computer when it's done.\n\nWhat's New!!\n\n(Released: Jul 11 2014)\n\n- Fixed detections of two separate video and audio streams in Chrome browser\n- Improved IDM download engine\n- Fixed bugs\n\nInstall Notes!!\n\n1.Install IDM\n2.Make sure to close IDM completely after installation\n3.Run patch as admin and activate it to Full Version\n4.Done, open the app, Enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed the app!! to make our upload successful :)\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e845a085887b60c494117c04158efb329456f1","amp;dn":"Internet+Download+Manager+6.21+FINAL+%2B+Patch+-+%7BCyclonoid%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e845a085887b60c494117c04158efb329456f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,232,69,160,133,136,123,96,196,148,17,124,4,21,142,251,50,148,86,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
