Anyone who is engaged in a creative pursuit will no doubt identify with these wonderful cartoons by award-winning artist Elizabeth Cameron of creative wannabes doing everything except actually getting down to work.  \n\n&quot;For most people creativity is a serious business,&quot; says Julia Cameron. &quot;They forget the telling phrase 'the play of ideas' and think that they need to knuckle down and work more. Often, the reverse is true. They need to play.&quot; Ultimately, the characters in this book show us how we can turn our procrastination into play and our play into great work. With this delightful volume, Julia Cameron once again hits the nail on the head on the subject of creativity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36208e13052b6095de3e9b28e642510f131c4d31","amp;dn":"How+to+Avoid+Making+Art.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36208e13052b6095de3e9b28e642510f131c4d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,32,142,19,5,43,96,149,222,62,155,40,230,66,81,15,19,28,77,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
