Could the tumor-regulating properties of cannabinoidsÃ‚ï¿½ someday replace the debilitating drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation that harms as often as it heals?\n     Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries in this feature-length documentary.\n     Using original and archival footage, the film presents controversial but highly convincing evidence that this forbidden herb has healing properties beyond any other plant on the planet interacting as it does with the bodys own endocannabinoid systemÃ‚ï¿½ to keep us fit and disease-free.\n     What if Cannabis Cured CancerÃ‚ï¿½ explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the Ã…â€œendocannabinoidsÃ‚ï¿½ inside us along with any cannabinoids we ingest fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodys healthy cells.\n     Like the old parable of the beggar who was sitting on a treasure chest but never bothered to look inside, governments and the medical establishment have been slow to realize the miraculous anti-cancer properties of marijuana. Finally, in this extraordinary documentary, the truth comes out.\n     A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabis and perhaps even the future of medicine. Written and directed by BBC filmmaker Len Richmond. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor Peter Coyote.
