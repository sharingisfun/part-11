These are all the tracks that i know of, so if there's more that i missed please alert me in the comments section. The most popular track is the much requested &quot;Derrick Explosion&quot; scene music. Thing is, it doesn't exist. It is a modified version of the 2003 track &quot;Convergence&quot; from the soundtrack &quot;Bodysong&quot;. Although, if you'd like to try to re-create the music close to the way it sounds in the &quot;Derrick Explosion&quot; scene, you'll be happy to know that, along with other changes, it was basically a combination of &quot;Convergence&quot; and the track &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;.\n\n\nContents:\n\nJonny Greenwood (There Will Be Blood)\nOpen Spaces.mp3\t        9.09 MiB\nHenry Plainview.mp3\t9.81 MiB\nProspectors Arrive.mp3\t10.59 MiB\nProven Lands.mp3\t4.37 MiB\nFuture Markets.mp3\t6.28 MiB\nHW - Hope Of New Fields.mp3\t5.84 MiB\nThere Will Be Blood.mp3\t4.91 MiB\nStranded The Line.mp3\t5.51 MiB\nProspectors Quartet.mp3\t6.86 MiB\nOil.mp3\t7.23 MiB\nEat Him By His Own Light.mp3    6.26 MiB\n\n(Bodysong)\nConvergence.mp3    6.11 MiB \n\n(Towering Above The Rest)\nSmear.mp3     17.08 MiB\n\nPopcorn Superhet Receiver.mp3      22.67 MiB\nRecorded at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle features Brad Lubman conducting\n\nArvo PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rt - Fratres.mp3   11.99 MiB\nComposer: Arvo Part\nPerformer: I Fiamminghi(Orchestra of Flanders)\nConducter: Rudolf Werthen\n\n\n(Great Violin Concertos)\nConcerto For Violin And Orchestra In D Major, Op.77 Allegro non troppo.mp3\t19.45 MiB\nComposer: Johannes Brahms\nConductor: Herbert von Karajan\nPerformer: Anne-Sophie Mutter\nOrchestra: Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (Berliner Philharmoniker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3652d868d0235712c7aa0d69395fafa90f18958a","amp;dn":"There+Will+Be+Blood+%282007%29+Extended+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3652d868d0235712c7aa0d69395fafa90f18958a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,82,216,104,208,35,87,18,199,170,13,105,57,95,175,169,15,24,149,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
