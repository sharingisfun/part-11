Its use is allowed in commercial environment and companies, not only for personal use.\n\nThis version comes with all the features included in OCCT, and adds the following :\n\nCustom test : a test composed of your own application ! Just fill in three batch files : one for starting your test, one for stopping it, one for reporting its status, and OCCT will take care of the rest ! With that, you can use your own scenarios to test your computer, with monitoring as if it was a regular OCCT Test !\nMonitoring-only test : A time period where OCCT won't do anything but recording, as if it was during a built-in test. You'll see how the temperatures, voltages, fans, CPU and memory behaved during this time priod ! Very useful to see the computer's behaviour in real end-user usage, and for monitoring various apps.\nAllows CSV Output of all sensors alongside graphs - you can now build your own graphs !\nCustomize the graph output folder : you will no longer need to clean up your customer's &quot;My Documents&quot; folder. You can tell OCCT to put the graph in its own folder, or anywhere else !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:365dc494ca70609f9314eaef554306394a5afd24","amp;dn":"OCCT+Pro+4.3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"365dc494ca70609f9314eaef554306394a5afd24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,93,196,148,202,112,96,159,147,20,234,239,85,67,6,57,74,90,253,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
