The video is exactly the same as this torrent (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7959464/Firefly.2002.[_Ep_1-14_].1080p.BluRay.x264.anoXmous), the only difference is the inclusion of .nfo files and the files are renamed. I also deleted the swedish subs because whatever. Swedish people speak English anyway.  Obviously I'm using the DVD order.\n\nHope it works out for you!
