Challenge One is a teardown: demolishing a wall to make room for bunk beds. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a test of patience and planning, but at times it seems more like handymen gone wild. Challenge Two is building a picnic area Ã¢â‚¬â€ complete with gazebo, table and barbecue. But a gross misuse of tools throws a wrench into the entire project. Challenge Three gives the teams a chance to redeem themselves: building a boat lift. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all rather alien to our land-loving couples Ã¢â‚¬â€ who come up with very different versions. Hey, whatever floats your boat lift!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 27-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f469ec29d28ea715b0b8029c3da82d0e89ad41","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E03.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f469ec29d28ea715b0b8029c3da82d0e89ad41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,244,105,236,41,210,142,167,21,176,184,2,156,61,168,45,14,137,173,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
