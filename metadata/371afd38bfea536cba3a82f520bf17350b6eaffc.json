They were originally formed to serve as Clyde McPhatter's (of Billy Ward &amp; the Dominoes) backing group in 1953. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe comment field in the tag info &quot;Lead Tenor: Clyde McPhatter 2nd Tenor: Charlie White Baritone: William Joseph Lamont Bass: Bill Brown&quot; is taken from the CD comment.
