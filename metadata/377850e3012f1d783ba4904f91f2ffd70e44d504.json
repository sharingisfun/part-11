It was directed by Bob Rafelson, from a screenplay by Ronald Bass.\n\nDebra Winger as Alexandra Barnes \nTheresa Russell as Catherine Petersen \nSami Frey as Paul Nuytten \nDennis Hopper as Ben Dumers \nNicol Williamson as William McCrory \nTerry O'Quinn as Alexandra's boss Bruce \nJames Hong as H Shin - Honolulu private investigator \nDiane Ladd as Etta \n\nThere is a lot to like about Black Widow. The film has a distinctive look that emphasizes realism while creating a stylized aesthetic. Lush shots of Hawaiian scenery contrast with noirish interiors. A careful color scheme employs primary colors that skirt garish, but tend to unify the image. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall is responsible for the distinctive look of many great films, such as Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Beauty, and Road to Perdition. Black Widow isn't his master work, but it is obvious that care and craftsmanship went into the visual feel of the film.\n\nMost of Black Widow's interest is generated by the central relationship. Debra Winger and Theresa Russell's characters are locked in a deadly spiral of attraction and repulsion that transcends the usual hunte","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377850e3012f1d783ba4904f91f2ffd70e44d504","amp;dn":"Black+Widow+%5B1987%5D+Bob+Rafelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377850e3012f1d783ba4904f91f2ffd70e44d504","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,120,80,227,1,47,29,120,59,164,144,79,145,242,255,215,14,68,213,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
