From lullabies sung to sleepy children to chants of celebration, women are important bearers of tradition. Unlike some areas in the world where females are discouraged from taking part in public musical performance, in sub-Saharan Africa, music is an essential social activity for all members of the community. \nWhile many musical instruments are traditionally played exclusively by men, women often provide the voice of Africa?s music. This legacy carries over from traditional to contemporary music, and many of today?s most popular singers in Africa are women. \nWomen of Africa features Putumayo?s favorite songs by women from Algeria to Zimbabwe. Ranging from internationally revered artists like AngÃƒÂ¨lique Kidjo (Benin), Tarika (Madagascar), Women of Mambazo (South Africa), Khadja Nin (Burundi) and Dorothy Masuka (Zimbabwe), to rising stars such as Judith Sephuma (South Africa), Souad Massi (Algeria), and Sibongile Khumalo (South Africa), to new discoveries Nawal (Comoros), Maria de Barros (Cape Verde), KaÃƒÂ¯ssa (Cameroon), and Dobet GnahorÃƒÂ© (Ivory Coast), the artists on Women of Africa represent a wide spectrum of today?s African music scene. \n\n\nTracklist:\n01.Judith Sephuma - Le Tshephile Mang \n02.Angelique Kidjo - Bahia \n03.Maria de Barros - Mi Nada Um Ca Tem \n04.Sibongile Khumalo - Mayihlome \n05.Tarika - Retany \n06.KaÃƒÂ¯ssa - To Ndje \n07.Dorothy Masuka - Mfan&amp;#039; Omncane \n08.Nawal - Hima \n09.Dobet GnahorÃƒÂ© - Abiani \n10.Souad Massi - Raoui \n11.Khadja Nin - Sina Mali, Sina Deni \n12.Women of Mambazo - Vimba\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:378147b7db898e831cc9e25a9e5ed1f00c00d31c","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Woman+of+Africa+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"378147b7db898e831cc9e25a9e5ed1f00c00d31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,129,71,183,219,137,142,131,28,201,226,90,158,94,209,240,12,0,211,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
