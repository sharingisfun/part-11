Born in Stockholm in 1989, Berg only started making music at the age of 18, writing and remixing tracks in his bedroom which he then leaked onto various blogs. Influenced by Daft Punk and Steve Angello, his melodic house sound gained a huge following, and led to support from TiÃŽÂ´sto, who invited him to perform a weekly residency at Privilege in Ibiza, and Pete Tong, who released first single &quot;Manman&quot; through his Bedroom Bedlam label. After he remixed tracks for Little Boots, Robyn, and Dizzee Rascal, Berg's first mainstream release, the Ministry of Sound instrumental &quot;Seek Bromance,&quot; became a huge hit across Europe and later in the U.K., thanks to a vocal version featuring Amanda Wilson. ~ Jon O'Brien, Rovi\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
