Selected and translated from the French by Gilbert Bowen and with an Introduction by Max Adereth.\n\nISBN: 0714539953 | 157 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF\n\n\nPaul Ãƒâ€°luard (1895-1952), was a popular French poet who was one of the founders of the surrealist movement.\n\nHis great lyric gift, coupled with a sense of humour and a political consciousness natural to anyone who fought in the First World War and later survived the German occupation of France in 1940, made him an all-round poet with an appeal both to the general and literary reader.\n\nThis bilingual edition contains a representative selection of poems from different periods and different aspects of his vast output.  A member of the original surrealist group, Ãƒâ€°luard's name is associated with those of Breton, Aragon, Arp, Dali, Ernst and others who changed the direction of the arts in the twenties and thirties.  His war poems appeared in underground editions raising the morale of the French Resistance, while his famous poem &quot;LibertÃƒÂ©&quot; was dropped on French towns by the RAF.\n\nThanks to Wattayo for the original scan of this file.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37946e9cfa2240ef07f7d198b2871f577f4cfa90","amp;dn":"Paul+Eluard+-+Selected+Poems+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37946e9cfa2240ef07f7d198b2871f577f4cfa90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,148,110,156,250,34,64,239,7,247,209,152,178,135,31,87,127,76,250,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
