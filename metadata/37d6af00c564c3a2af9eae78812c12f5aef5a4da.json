It also offers a perspective on understanding how modern physical sciences are tapped to ensure public good. \r\nA Science of Impurity explores the social framework in which chemists came to work on problems of water quality, the strategies they used to study the environment, their conclusions and their role in dealing with a fearful public. \r\nFor historians of science, researchers and planners in the water industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d6af00c564c3a2af9eae78812c12f5aef5a4da","amp;dn":"A+Science+of+Impurity+-+Water+Analysis+in+Nineteenth+Century+Bri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d6af00c564c3a2af9eae78812c12f5aef5a4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,214,175,0,197,100,195,162,175,158,174,120,129,44,18,245,174,245,164,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
