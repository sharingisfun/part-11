Burnside. A two-piece band comprised of Frederick\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“JoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Evans IV on slide guitar and vocals and Bren Beck on drums and anything else he can bang on, they may cruise the same sort\nof modal North Mississippi blues territory but, with screamed and distorted vocals pushed through what sounds like a shorted-out\nkaraoke mike, they also sound like a lo-fi swampy version of the Stooges, full of rampaging insistence and impatience. Rock Them\nBack to Hell! is hardly a change of form for a band that calls what it does Ã¢â‚¬Å“voodoo hillbillyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\npunk bluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and approaches things with a frenzied roar that makes paint curl and shake its ass. From the first track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zombie Blocked,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nclear through to the last, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Righteous,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Evans sings like heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gargling cigarette butts and ashes on the midnight train to nowhere,\nwhile Beck pounds out rhythms that could make cement crack. This is what Left Lane Cruiser do, stomping across the sonic landscape\nlike they want to shear off every blade of grass. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing, really, and uncomplicated Ã¢â‚¬â€ stomp and scream like life depended\non it. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clarity in that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ee0b3eb1a84611ae59f5b33ab7420235f182f8","amp;dn":"Left+Lane+Cruiser+-+Rock+Them+Back+to+Hell+%282013%29+FLAC+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ee0b3eb1a84611ae59f5b33ab7420235f182f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,238,11,62,177,168,70,17,174,89,245,179,58,183,66,2,53,241,130,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
