In it, veteran Hollywood comedy writer John Vorhaus offers his tools of the trade to writers, comics, and anyone else who wants to be funny. Among these indispensable tools are Clash of Context, Tension and Release, The Law of Comic Opposites, The Wildly Inappropriate Response, and The Myth of the Last Great Idea. Readers will learn that comedy = truth and pain (the essence of the comic situation), that fear is the biggest roadblock to comedy (kill the ferocious editor within and rich, useful comic ideas will flow), and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f0187c504aff6673c6874fdd33f1dd617017ed","amp;dn":"The+Comic+Toolbox+-+John+Vorhaus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f0187c504aff6673c6874fdd33f1dd617017ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,240,24,124,80,74,255,102,115,198,135,79,221,51,241,221,97,112,23,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
