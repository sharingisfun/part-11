London never had the range of Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughan, but often used restraint, softness, and subtlety to maximum advantage. An actress as well as a singer, London played with heavyweights like Gregory Peck and Rock Hudson in various films, and was married to Jack Webb of Dragnet fame for seven years before marrying songwriter Bobby Troup (&quot;Route 66&quot;). London performed her biggest hit, &quot;Cry Me a River,&quot; in the Jayne Mansfield film The Girl Can't Help It. After recording her last album, Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, in 1969, she continued to act -- playing a nurse on the NBC medical drama Emergency from 1974-1978. Despite her &quot;sex symbol&quot; image -- London was known for her sexy LP covers, which make them collector's items -- she was surprisingly shy, and left show biz altogether in the late '70s. In the mid-'90s London suffered a stroke, which led to a half-decade of poor health and ultimately contributed to her death on October 18, 2000. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_London&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_London&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMp3 172kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380e1809cf5a7ad4782836a39a633b0e56225e03","amp;dn":"Julie+London+-+Cry+Me+A+River+%283+cd%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380e1809cf5a7ad4782836a39a633b0e56225e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,14,24,9,207,90,122,212,120,40,54,163,154,99,59,14,86,34,94,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
