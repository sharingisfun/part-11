It is a concept album and it was released on March 21, 2000, through Spitfire Records.\n\nMagica marks the return of guitarist Craig Goldy, who also has performed on Dio's album Dream Evil and in the later release Master of the Moon. Magica also features Jimmy Bain on bass, Simon Wright on drums, and Scott Warren on keyboards. Band leader Ronnie James Dio produced this concept album. \n\nThe album was originally planned to be the first part of a trilogy of concept albums, and shortly before beginning his tour with Heaven &amp; Hell, Dio announced his intention to start the Magica II &amp; III album after the tour's end, but he died shortly after of stomach cancer on May 16, 2010. The only song released from Magica II &amp; III was titled &quot;Electra&quot;\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n    \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Discovery&quot;   \t \t             0:54\n2. \t&quot;Magica Theme&quot;   \t \t     1:16\n3. \t&quot;Lord of the Last Day&quot;         \t     4:04\n4. \t&quot;Fever Dreams&quot;   \t \t     4:37\n5. \t&quot;Turn to Stone&quot;   \t  \t     5:19\n6. \t&quot;Feed My Head&quot;   \t  \t     5:39\n7. \t&quot;Eriel&quot;   \t  \t             7:25\n8. \t&quot;Challis&quot;   \t  \t             4:25\n9. \t&quot;As Long as It's Not About Love&quot;     6:04\n10. \t&quot;Losing My Insanity&quot;   \t  \t     5:04\n11. \t&quot;Otherworld&quot;   \t  \t             4:56\n12. \t&quot;Magica (Reprise)&quot;   \t\t     1:53\n13. \t&quot;Lord of the Last Day (Reprise)&quot;     1:44\n14.     &quot;Magica Story&quot;                       18:26\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38225c1e0b251647a9cee10cc3f33dda9f1cc045","amp;dn":"Dio+-+%282000%29+Magica+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38225c1e0b251647a9cee10cc3f33dda9f1cc045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,34,92,30,11,37,22,71,169,206,225,12,195,243,61,218,159,28,192,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
