Instead, the Scottish singer/songwriter's self-released debut full-length bears haunting similarities to the likes of Nick Drake's Pink Moon, hardly the way to mainstream stardom no matter how many car commercials it inspires. Nearly a third of the album will be familiar to those who already have Murdoch's 2004 EP Four Songs, three-quarters of which is reprised here, including &quot;Orange Sky,&quot; the aforementioned small-screen favorite. (&quot;It's Only Fear&quot; is the sole track that didn't make the leap, insuring collector-geek status for the EP.) The remaining eight songs are, in the best possible sense, more of the same, and in the case of the first single &quot;Dream About Flying&quot; and the haunted opener &quot;All My Days,&quot; they surpass the older songs. Murdoch's murmuring, Drake-like vocals and John Martyn-style acoustic guitar are at the forefront of the album, with only the most minimal accompaniment. Detractors might dismiss Time Without Consequence as the work of a Cat Stevens for the Garden State generation, but there's a always a place for hushed intimacy and delicate folk-pop singer/songwriters, and Alexi Murdoch fills the bill without the mewling self-absorption of the emo contingent. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/10/13/alexi-murdoch/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386487ee9696439e125fcf118a1894affcb91f6c","amp;dn":"Alexi+Murdoch...Time+Without+Consequence%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386487ee9696439e125fcf118a1894affcb91f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,100,135,238,150,150,67,158,18,95,207,17,138,24,148,175,252,185,31,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
