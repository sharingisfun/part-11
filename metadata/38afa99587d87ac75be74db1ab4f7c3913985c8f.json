I highly recommend this.\nRip 320KBS\nFcover Included.\n\nPutumayoÃ‚Â´s Women of the World: Celtic II is quite an excellent CD, filled with techno mixed and modernized music of the Celtic peoples. This CD provides great examples of the wonderful music played by the Celts. Being part Scotts and English, I was quite interested in this style of music to begin with, and I am not dissapointed at all with this CD. I, however, don&amp;#039;t recommend this CD to people who aren&amp;#039;t fans of this style! If you don&amp;#039;t like Celtic music to begin with, then I doubt you&amp;#039;ll be interested in this, and the 30 second demos do this CD no justice. Natalie MacMaster&amp;#039;s &quot;The Drunken Piper&quot;, while as I could see had no piping in it, had excellent fiddling and is a great way to open up the CD. Over all, this CD totally deserves a 5/5, if not more!\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. The Drunken Piper - Natalie MacMaster   \n2. Sovay - Cristina Crawlay, Kerstein Blodig   \n3. The Rights Of Man - Eileen Ivers   \n4. Bog A&amp;#039; Lochain - Mary Jane Lamond  \n5. Jericho - Susan McKeown &amp; The Chanting House  \n6. Black Is The Colour - Marcy D&amp;#039;Arcy &amp; The Prodigal Sons  \n7. Ta Se Na La - Eithne Ni Uallachain   \n8. It Ain&amp;#039;t Funny - Pamela Morgan    \n9. Raindance - Annie Grace &amp; Lynn Morrison   \n10. Mi Le M&amp;#039; Uilinn - Karen Matheson  \n11. Cowboi - Julie Murphy    \n12. Home Again In Eireann - Sharon Murphy With Whisp\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38afa99587d87ac75be74db1ab4f7c3913985c8f","amp;dn":"Putumayos+Presents-Women+of+the+World+Celtic+2+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38afa99587d87ac75be74db1ab4f7c3913985c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,175,169,149,135,216,122,199,91,231,77,177,171,79,124,57,19,152,92,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
