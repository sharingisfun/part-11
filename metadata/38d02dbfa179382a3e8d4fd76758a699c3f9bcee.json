A version for Wii is also developed by Exient. The game will support 3D-display output on PlayStation 3 and Windows. Hot Pursuit has been described as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; addition to the Need for Speed franchise, it is the 14th title in the franchise and is scheduled for release in November 2010.\n\nGameplay:\nHot Pursuit goes back to the Need for Speed series' roots and takes on the gameplay style of earlier &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;-titles in the Need for Speed franchise with exotic cars and high-speed police chases. It is primarily inspired by the original Need for Speed on 3DO. Hot Pursuit lets the player play as either a cop or a racer and will feature a full career mode for both roles. The relationship between the cops and racers is described as &quot;a dog chasing down a rabbit&quot; with the cops being more powerful compared to the racers. Each side has several power-ups including calling for roadblocks and radar jamming. The game takes place in fictional location called Seacrest County. It is entirely open-world and features over 100 miles (160 km) of open road and, as a reference, it is four times larger than Paradise City, the city of Burnout Paradise. According to Criterion is the single-player section, somewhere between 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“15 hours long, but with lots of replay value.\nHot Pursuit also features a new social interaction system called &quot;Autolog&quot; described as &quot;Facebook for the game&quot;. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes with up to eight players; as an option to live multiplayer racing, player can post records and achievements on the Autolog-feed for friends to see, which they then can try to beat. Autolog also contains an experience system called &quot;Bounty&quot;. So far the only game mode revealed is &quot;Interceptor 1 vs 1&quot;, where one cop chases one racer, but more game modes are to be revealed. Other features include the player being able to add custom soundtracks to the game.\n\nCars:\nThe driving model of the game is described as &quot;fun and accessible&quot;. It is not as arcade-styled as Burnout Paradise, but far from a simulator. All cars in Hot Pursuit are licensed real-world supercars, and the carlist is described as &quot;all the cars you dreamed of driving, in the way you dreamed of driving them&quot;. Most cars will be available to both racers and cops, but a few will be exclusive to each side. Also exclusively featured in the Hot Pursuit is the Porsche 918 Spyder. Ferrari however, last seen in a Shift DLC-pack but notably absent from all other Need for Speed games since Hot Pursuit 2, will also be absent from Hot Pursuit.\n\nPlot:\nRecent games in the Need for Speed franchise included a story, but Matt Webster, producer of Hot Pursuit said &quot;We didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really think it was necessary to include a story. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a cop, the aim is to go up the ranks, while a racerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aim is to get to the highest rank they can.&quot;\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\n* OS: Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7\n* CPU: Intel P4 @ 2.6 Ghz or similar\n* RAM: 2 GB\n* HDD: 7 GB free disk space\n* Graphics: 256 MB Graphics Memory\n* Sound Card: DirectX 9 Compatible\n* DirectX: Version 9.0c\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d02dbfa179382a3e8d4fd76758a699c3f9bcee","amp;dn":"Need+For+Speed+Hot+Pursuit+%282010%29+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPCDVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d02dbfa179382a3e8d4fd76758a699c3f9bcee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,208,45,191,161,121,56,42,62,141,79,215,103,88,166,153,195,249,188,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
