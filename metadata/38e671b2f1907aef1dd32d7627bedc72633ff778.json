The album showcases an electronica-influenced sound partly inspired by the industrial and drum and bass culture of the 1990s.\nDavid Bowie returned to the studio five days after finishing up his tour for his previous album, Outside. Bowie said &quot;I really thought it would be great if we could do a photo, almost a sonic photograph of what we were like at that time. So, Reeves [Gabrels] and I started writing immediately after we finished on the road.&quot; Despite going into the studio with no material ready to record,[4] the album took only 2 1/2 weeks to record (typical for a Bowie album).[5] Bowie compared this album with his 1980 album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), saying &quot;I think there's quite a link between Scary Monsters and this album, to a certain extent. Certainly, the same intensity of aggression.&quot; Bowie described the album as an effort &quot;to produce some really dynamic, aggressive-sounding material.&quot;\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n01.&quot;Little Wonder&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:02\n02.&quot;Looking for Satellites&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n03.&quot;Battle for Britain (The Letter)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n04.&quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:22\n05.&quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:50\n06.&quot;Telling Lies&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:49\n07.&quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\n08 &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n09.&quot;Law (Earthlings on Fire)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n\nBonus disc:\n01.&quot;Little Wonder (Censored Video Edit)&quot;\n02.&quot;Little Wonder (Junior Vasquez Club Mix)&quot;\n03.&quot;Little Wonder (Danny Saber Dance Mix)&quot;\n04.&quot;Seven Years in Tibet (Mandarin Version)&quot; (The Mandarin title of this version translates as &quot;A Fleeting Moment&quot;.)\n05.&quot;Dead Man Walking (Moby Mix 1)&quot;\n06.&quot;Dead Man Walking (Moby Mix 2 US Promo 12&quot;)&quot;\n07.&quot;Telling Lies (Feelgood Mix)&quot;\n08.&quot;Telling Lies (Paradox Mix)&quot;\n09.&quot;I'm Afraid of Americans (Showgirls Soundtrack Version)&quot;\n10. &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans (Nine Inch Nails V1 Mix)&quot;\n11.&quot;I'm Afraid of Americans (Nine Inch Nails V1 Clean Edit)&quot;\n12.&quot;V-2 Schneider (Tao Jones Index)&quot;\n13.&quot;Pallas Athena (Tao Jones Index)&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e671b2f1907aef1dd32d7627bedc72633ff778","amp;dn":"%281997%29+David+Bowie+-+Earthling+%2B+Bonus+EP+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e671b2f1907aef1dd32d7627bedc72633ff778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,230,113,178,241,144,122,239,29,211,45,118,39,190,220,114,99,63,247,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
