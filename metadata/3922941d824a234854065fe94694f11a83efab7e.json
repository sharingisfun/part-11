Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever was originally aired in 1983 and featured many of the original artists and groups that helped build a historic dynasty in music.  This special featured great Motown artists and groups such as Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles, Diana Ross &amp; The Surpremes, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and of course Michael Jackson (with the birth of the Moonwalk) and his brothers The Jacksons.  Hosted by the late great actor/comdedian Richard Pryor with a surprise appearance by the man who founded Motown...Hitsville U.S.A...Berry Gordy, Jr.  The sound is around a 7/10 with video around a 8/10 as it was a VHS transfer.  I hope you all enjoy this rare piece of music history...and remember to seed so that everyone can experience this once in a lifetime moment in music history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3922941d824a234854065fe94694f11a83efab7e","amp;dn":"Motown+25%3A+Yesterday%2C+Today%2C+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3922941d824a234854065fe94694f11a83efab7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,34,148,29,130,74,35,72,84,6,95,233,70,148,241,26,131,239,171,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
