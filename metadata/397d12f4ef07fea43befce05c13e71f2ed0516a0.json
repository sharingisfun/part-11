It was directed by John Boorman who also co-wrote the screenplay with William\nGoodhart from an original story by Rospo Pallenberg. The author of the &quot;The Exorcist&quot;,\nWilliam Peter Blatty, was not involved in the production, and received credit only for creation\nof the characters.\n\nPlot\n\nFather Philip Lamont (Richard Burton), who is struggling with his faith, is assigned by the\nCardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), who had\nbeen killed in the course of exorcising the Assyrian demon Pazuzu from Regan MacNeil\n(Linda Blair). While Lamont, who's had some experience at exorcism, thinks of Merrin as a\nsaint, he is actually up on posthumous heresy charges. Some Church authorities are not sure\nthe exorcism should have been performed (even though it was officially approved by the local\nBishop) Merrins writings are considered very controversial. Apparently, Church authorities\nare trying to modernize and do not want to acknowledge that Satan (in terms of an actual evil\nentity) exists.\n\n\n\nGeneral #0\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 701 MiB\nPlayTime : 1h 52mn\nOverall bit rate : 867 Kbps\n\nVideo #0\n\nWidth : 704 pixels\nHeight : 560 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.078\nStandard : PAL\n\nAudio #0\n\nCodec : AAC\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 93.9 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 122 Kbps\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : English\n\n\n\nDVD @600/dpi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397d12f4ef07fea43befce05c13e71f2ed0516a0","amp;dn":"Exorcist+II+The+Heretic+%281977%29++%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397d12f4ef07fea43befce05c13e71f2ed0516a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,125,18,244,239,7,254,164,59,239,206,5,193,62,113,242,237,5,22,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
