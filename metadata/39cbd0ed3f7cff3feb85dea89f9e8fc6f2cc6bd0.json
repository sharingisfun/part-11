Most of these copies seem to have been converted from pdf versions by Helga Phugly; these are relatively low-res editions. However, for a few issues I was able to find true DCP versions of the scans; the scanners are all listed in the individual filenames. This fills a request from KAT. Thanks to all the scanner groups for their efforts, please seed and enjoy! :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cbd0ed3f7cff3feb85dea89f9e8fc6f2cc6bd0","amp;dn":"Flare+Adventures+01-31+%281992-1993%2C+2005-2012%7CHelga+Phugly%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cbd0ed3f7cff3feb85dea89f9e8fc6f2cc6bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,203,208,237,63,124,255,63,235,133,222,168,159,158,143,198,242,204,107,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
