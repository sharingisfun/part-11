However, you can extend the functionality of WordPress and display different types of content according to your own rules by creating custom post types and taxonomies. In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows how to create a plugin for new post types and taxonomies, create new post types and taxonomies (hierarchal and nonhierarchal), and build templates that display the custom post types and taxonomies in new and effective ways.\nTopics include:\n\n    What are WordPress custom post types and taxonomies\n    Creating and testing the plugin\n    Creating posts with custom post types\n    Building basic custom taxonomies\n    Creating custom post type templates\n    Including custom post types in the front page index\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d52ff11acab46cc59e9b025f6951188ed414f2","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+WordPress%3A+Custom+Post+Types+and+Taxonomies+with+Mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d52ff11acab46cc59e9b025f6951188ed414f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,213,47,241,26,202,180,108,197,158,155,2,95,105,81,24,142,212,20,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
