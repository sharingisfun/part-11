Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970s. Though often referred to by the public as &quot;The Carpenters&quot;, the duo's official name on authorized recordings and press materials is simply &quot;Carpenters&quot;,\nwithout the definite article. (Wiki)\n\n\nThis is the Carpenters best-of collection (there are many) that gives the listener their strongest Top 10 songs in one flawless package. From the hopeful opener, &quot;We've Only Just Begun,&quot; to the wistful closing track, &quot;Close to You,&quot; these songs epitomize the band's lush and sincere style that won them so much adulation (and many awards) in the 1970s. Karen's passionate vocals take the listener on dizzying rides on &quot;Hurting Each Other&quot; and &quot;Rainy Days and Mondays,&quot; and irresistibly pleasant ditties like &quot;Top of the World&quot; and &quot;Sing&quot; continue to rule the perfect-songs-for-the-car-radio kingdom.moreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Their take on the Beatles &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is inoffensive if not agreeable, and weepy tunes like &quot;It's Going to Take Some Time&quot; and &quot;Goodbye to Love&quot; can still wring a sniffle out of the sensitive listener. This collection signifies an important period in the timeline of pop-music history. --Lorry Fleming\n\n\nThe Singles 1969-1973\n\n01  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - We've Only Just Begun\n02  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Top Of The World\n03  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Ticket To Ride\n04  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Superstar\n05  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Rainy Days And Mondays\n06  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Goodbye To Love\n07  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Yesterday Once More\n08  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - It's Going To Take Some Time\n09  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Sing\n10  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - For All We Know\n11  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - Hurting Each Other\n12  Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973 - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles:_1969-1973&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles:_1969-1973&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carpenters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carpenters&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d7f19dd4f38748f7f36f6c022207e0eb9d0962","amp;dn":"Carpenters+-+The+Singles+1969-1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d7f19dd4f38748f7f36f6c022207e0eb9d0962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,215,241,157,212,243,135,72,247,243,111,108,2,34,7,224,235,157,9,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
