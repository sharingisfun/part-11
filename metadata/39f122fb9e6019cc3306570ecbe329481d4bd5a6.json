At first an exciting adventure, young Guy SajerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all the terrifying Soviet artillery. As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland Division, he fought in all the great battles from Kursk to Kharkov. His German footsoldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective makes The Forgotten Soldier a unique war memoir, the book that the Christian Science Monitor said &quot;may well be the book about World War II which has been so long awaited.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f122fb9e6019cc3306570ecbe329481d4bd5a6","amp;dn":"The+Forgotten+Soldier+-+Guy+Sajer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f122fb9e6019cc3306570ecbe329481d4bd5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,241,34,251,158,96,25,204,51,6,87,14,203,227,41,72,29,75,213,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
