Then he retains the\nhalf-Persian, ineffably beautiful (and insatiable) biology student Yasmin to personally\nadminister Blister Beetle to each of the famous 51 and, during each incredible aftermath,\nto collect the priceless essence of fatherhood for freezing. Well. As we follow Yasmin across\nEurope -- from Genius to Genius and Royal to Royal -- amazing scenes take place. George\nBernard ShawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ultimate secret is revealed. Freud is utterly bewildered. Picasso doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\neven put down his paintbrush . . .\n      How does Yasmin gain access to the great? Which of Them is interestingly activated by\nthe Beetle Pill: King Alfonso? Proust? Kipling perhaps? Who will ultimately make a fortune\nfrom the scheme? And will the world be incresingly populated (and, of course, enhanced) by\nthe secret progeny and grand-progeny, ad infinitum, of the dazzling 51? These are only a\nfew of the questions answered in a book in which you encounter -- under quite\nextraordinary circumstances -- just about everybody who was anybody you might like to\nhave had for your dad.\n\n\n^ text from inside front cover notes.\n\n\n* I've Also included two of his young readers classics:\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate factory\n\nand\n\nCharlie and the Great Glass Elevator\n\n\n*These are all NEW PDF formatted versions that I personally spent a couple hours each on to get right and readable.\n\nI will seed these through the evening, and on &amp; off through the weekend, so PLEASE SEED!!\n\nI hope to seed for a while, but I may loose my apartment and internet soon.\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a0825ae9e666e5c91e17a4c66dc456da56b30b5","amp;dn":"Roald+Dahl+-+My+Uncle+Oswald+%28NEW+PDF%29+%2B+2+more+all+new%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a0825ae9e666e5c91e17a4c66dc456da56b30b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,8,37,174,158,102,110,92,145,225,122,76,102,220,69,109,165,107,48,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
