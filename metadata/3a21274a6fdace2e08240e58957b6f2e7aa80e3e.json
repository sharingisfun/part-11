What really might have happened approx 1000BC, with the supernatural -- gods, sons of gods, demons, avatars, miracle weapons etc -- stripped from the narrative.\n\nTHE MAHABHARATA ENDURES AS THE GREAT EPIC OF INDIA. But while Jaya is the story of the Pandavas, told from the perspective of the victors of Kurukshetra; Ajaya is the narrative of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœunconquerableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Kauravas, who were decimated to the last man. At the heart of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful empire, a revolution is brewing. Bhishma, the noble patriarch of Hastinapura, is struggling to maintain the unity of his empire. On the throne sits Dhritarashtra, the blind King, and his foreign-born Queen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gandhari. In the shadow of the throne stands Kunti, the Dowager-Queen, burning with ambition to see her firstborn become the ruler, acknowledged by all. And in the wings: Parashurama, the enigmatic Guru of the powerful Southern Confederate, bides his time to take over and impose his will from mountains to ocean. Ekalavya, a young Nishada, yearns to break free of caste restrictions and become a warrior. Karna, son of a humble charioteer, travels to the South to study under the foremost Guru of the day and become the greatest archer in the land. Balarama, the charismatic leader of the Yadavas, dreams of building the perfect city by the sea and seeing his people prosperous and proud once more. Takshaka, guerilla leader of the Nagas, foments a revolution by the downtrodden as he lies in wait in the jungles of India, where survival is the only dharma. Jara, the beggar, and his blind dog Dharma, walk the dusty streets of India, witness to people and events far greater than they, as the Pandavas and the Kauravas confront their searing destinies. Amidst the chaos, Prince Suyodhana, heir of Hastinapura, stands tall, determined to claim his birthright and act according to his conscience. He is the maker of his own destiny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or so he believes. While in the corridors of the Hastinapura palace, a foreign Prince plots to destroy India. And the dice fallsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a21274a6fdace2e08240e58957b6f2e7aa80e3e","amp;dn":"Anand+Neelkantan+--+AJAYA+I+--+Roll+of+the+Dice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a21274a6fdace2e08240e58957b6f2e7aa80e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,33,39,74,111,218,206,46,8,36,14,88,149,123,111,46,122,168,14,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
