As president - John F. Kennedy. Because of the Cold War, the nation gripped by fear, but a new enemy threatens America - more dangerous and insidious communism. Top secret organization known as the &quot;Bureau&quot;, which knows only a small select group, is engaged in the investigation and cover-up of mysterious attacks an enemy from another world. In the role of Special Agent William Carter, you have to give orders himself to pull the trigger and lead the squad in a fascinating tactical third-person shooter. You will covert war with an unknown enemy, and at stake is the fate of all mankind. The task of the &quot;Bureau&quot; is simple - to survive, to adapt, to reflect the threat posed by the enemy and to protect civilians from the truth. Thus began the background initiative &quot;XCOM&quot;.\n\nFEATURES REPACK:\nÃ¢â€“Âª Do not recoded\nÃ¢â€“Âª Cut all languages Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹except Russian &amp; English\nÃ¢â€“Âª Present DLC:\n     &quot; Bonus Mission &quot;Decryptor&quot;\n     &quot; &quot;Easy Plasma Pistol&quot;\nÃ¢â€“Âª Decompression of archives is not used\nÃ¢â€“Âª Release of RG Origami","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a35466a4bdecc9bda3cce4d065c62a383a8040b","amp;dn":"The+Bureau+XCOM+Declassified+%28RUS%2FENG%29+RG+Origami","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a35466a4bdecc9bda3cce4d065c62a383a8040b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,53,70,106,75,222,204,155,218,60,206,77,6,92,98,163,131,168,4,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
