The tales of Londoners found in &quot;Parklife&quot; have been replaced by the twisted secret lives of suburban dwellers here. Huge production, strings, horns, and electronica all mix with their trademark witty Britpop. The centerpiece of the album is the great The Universal. The song is virtually a lullabye with orchestration, but shows some darkness with lines like - The future has been sold - and minor key staccato violins. An ode to a musical sound that Blur began to need a change from.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 7\nArtist: Blur\nAlbum: The Great Escape\nYear: 1995\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a49bec26d1157ba3d8d5782759f5328d8580149","amp;dn":"Blur+-+The+Great+Escape+%5BFLAC-1995%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a49bec26d1157ba3d8d5782759f5328d8580149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,73,190,194,109,17,87,186,61,141,87,130,117,159,83,40,216,88,1,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
