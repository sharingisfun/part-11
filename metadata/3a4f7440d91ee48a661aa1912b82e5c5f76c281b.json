Now Friedman delivers the geopolitical story that the mainstream media has been unable to uncover Ã¢â‚¬â€ the startling truth behind AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy and war effort in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.\n\nStratfor, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most respected private global intelligence firms, has an unmatched ability to provide clear perspective on the current geopolitical map. In America's Secret War, George Friedman identifies the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most dangerous enemies, delves into presidential strategies of the last quarter century, and reveals the real reasons behind the attack of 9/11Ã¢â‚¬â€and the Bush administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motivation for the war in Iraq. It describes in eye-opening detail AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s covert and overt efforts in the global war against terrorism: Not only are U.S. armies in combat on every continent, but since 9/11 the intelligence services of dozens of nations have been operating in close partnership with the CIA.\n\nDrawing on StratforÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast information-gathering network, Friedman presents an insightful picture of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world that goes far beyond what is reported on television and in other news media. \n\nAl QaedaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war plans and how they led to 9/11\n\nThe threat of a suitcase nuclear bomb in New York and how that changed the course of the war.\n\nThe deal the U.S. made with Russia and Iran which made the invasion of Afghanistan possible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and how those deals affect the United States today.\n\nHow fear and suspicion of the Saudis after 9-11 tore apart the Bush-Saudi relationship and why Saudi ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closest friends in the administration became the SaudiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst enemies.\n\nThe real reasons behind George W. BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invasion of Iraq and how WMD became the cover for a much deeper game.\n\nHow the CIA miscalculated about Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real plans, leaving the U.S. bogged down in the war.\n\nHow the war in Iraq began with a ruse, pretending that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“target of opportunityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ attack on Saddam Hussein had presented itself. \n\nThe real story about why the U.S. raises and lowers its alert status and why the United States canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find and destroy al Qaeda.\n\nThe strategic successes that are slowly leading the United States to victory\n\nAmerica's Secret War is an unprecedented look at the new world war being waged behind-the-scenes today. It is sure to stir debate and capture headlines around the world.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4f7440d91ee48a661aa1912b82e5c5f76c281b","amp;dn":"America%27s+Secret+War%3A+Inside+the+Hidden+Worldwide+Str+%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4f7440d91ee48a661aa1912b82e5c5f76c281b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,79,116,64,217,30,228,138,102,26,161,145,43,130,229,197,247,108,40,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
