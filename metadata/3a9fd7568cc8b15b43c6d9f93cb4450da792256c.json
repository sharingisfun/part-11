Used to tending the sick as they are, nothing could have prepared them for what they confront, first near Gallipoli, then on the Western Front.\n\nYet amid the carnage, Naomi and Sally Durance become the friends they never were at home and find themselves courageous in the face of extreme danger, as well as the hostility they encounter from some on their own side. There is great bravery, humor, and compassion, too, and the inspiring example of the remarkable women they serve alongside. In France, where Naomi nurses in a hospital set up by the eccentric Lady Tarlton while Sally works in a casualty clearing station, each meets an exceptional man: the kind of men for whom they might give up some of their precious independence Ã¢â‚¬â€ if only they all survive.\n\nAt once vast in scope and extraordinarily intimate, The Daughters of Mars brings World War I to vivid, concrete life from an unusual perspective. A searing and profoundly moving tale, it pays tribute to men and women of extraordinary moral resilience, even in the face of the incomprehensible horrors of modern war.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9fd7568cc8b15b43c6d9f93cb4450da792256c","amp;dn":"Thomas+Keneally+Daughters+of+Mars+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9fd7568cc8b15b43c6d9f93cb4450da792256c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,159,215,86,140,200,177,91,67,198,217,249,60,180,69,13,167,146,37,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
