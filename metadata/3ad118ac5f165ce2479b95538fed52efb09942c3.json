Sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, he became obsessed with one goal: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.\n\nCharriÃƒÂ¨re's astonishing autobiography, Papillon, was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape. Since then, it has become a treasured classic -- the gripping, shocking, ultimately uplifting odyssey of an innocent man who would not be defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;\nIn July 1967, CharriÃƒÂ¨re went to the French bookshop in Caracas and bought LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Astragale. Until then it had never occurred to him to write a line about his own adventures. \n\nHe was a man of action who loved life. He had great warmth, a sharp eye and the rich and somewhat gravelly voice of a man from the Midi. You can listen to him for hours because he tells stories likeÃ¢â‚¬â€well, like all the great storytellers. Thus the miracle happened: following the example of Albertine Sarrazin, with no contacts and free of any literary ambition (in his letter to me he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here are my adventures: have a professional write them upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), he wrote the way you tell a story. You see him, you feel him, you live his life, and if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your bad luck to have to stop at the bottom of a page just when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling you that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to go to the toilets (a place that has a multiple and important function in the bagne), you find yourself forced to turn the page because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer CharriÃƒÂ¨re who is going there, but you yourself.\n\n \n \nThree days after he had finished reading LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Astragale, he wrote at: one sitting the first two sections in a studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiral notebook. He stopped long enough to get some advice about this new adventureÃ¢â‚¬â€probably more astonishing to him than all the others that had come before; then at the start of 1968 launched into the rest.\n \n \n In two months he had finished all thirteen notebooks.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ad118ac5f165ce2479b95538fed52efb09942c3","amp;dn":"Papillon+-+Henri+Charriere+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ad118ac5f165ce2479b95538fed52efb09942c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,209,24,172,95,22,92,226,71,155,149,83,143,237,82,239,176,153,66,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
