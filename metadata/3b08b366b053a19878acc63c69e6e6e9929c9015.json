She retraces the journey of Georges Victor Du Noyer whose 35-year odyssey left a unique record of how Ireland looked during a period of great change.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Bog of Allen \r\nIn this first episode, Martha introduces us to Du Noyer's work. She enjoys his impressions of Glendalough - a place close to the hearts of her own parents. She gets wet at the Bog of Allen. And she marvels at the majesty of the Old Head of Kinsale.\r\n\r\n2)  Dunluce Castle \r\nIn this episode, Martha travels north, taking in the extraordinary beauty of Dunluce Castle, and onwards to Mussenden Temple - only a romantic would expect to find a house here and only a lunatic would build it. She marvels at how Belfast was shaped by the Victorians, and visits Kearney Point on the Ards Peninsula to find out what's in a name. And she journeys south to Dunmoe, overlooking the site of the Battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\n3)  Rock of Cashel \r\nThis week Martha examines places of power in Ireland as seen through Du Noyer's eyes. She traces the movement of power from Newgrange, through the Rock of Cashel, sees the magnificent Waterford Charter Roll, and ends up at the sumptuous Castletown House.\r\n\r\n4)  Blasket Islands \r\nIn her final journey, Martha hits the spiritual trail, starting with the Blasket Islands off the coast of Kerry. In the Dingle Peninsula, Du Noyer discovered clochÃ¡ns - stone beehive huts. Martha heads north on a spiritual trail, taking in the islands of the Fermanagh Lakelands - White Island, Boa Island and the renowned Station Island.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Great-Irish-Journeys-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3038 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 142 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 661 MB\r\n * Source: WEBRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05ndnvk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b08b366b053a19878acc63c69e6e6e9929c9015","amp;dn":"Great+Irish+Journeys+With+Martha+Kearney+4of4+Blasket+Islands+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b08b366b053a19878acc63c69e6e6e9929c9015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,8,179,102,176,83,161,152,120,172,198,60,105,230,230,233,146,156,144,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
