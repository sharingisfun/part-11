Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations. The weather, too, is quirky. \n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nWriter: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards and Julianne Moore\n\n\nSAMPLE DIRECT DOWNLOAD\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://verzend.be/en/file/44555/magno.mp4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://verzend.be/en/file/44555/magno.mp4.html&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdfc854490ba3d71a4657d3f19a0eb47d30844c","amp;dn":"Magnolia+%7B1999%7D+720p+BRRip+x264+-+HDMiCRO+by+Mr.KickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bdfc854490ba3d71a4657d3f19a0eb47d30844c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,223,200,84,73,11,163,215,26,70,87,211,241,154,14,180,125,48,132,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
