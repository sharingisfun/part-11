Unless otherwise stated, these are my rips.\n\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with this mystery/adventure series and want to try them, they are best read in chronological (time period) order. They were not all published in this order though, so don't go by the dates of publication.\nThe books span the time period from 1884-1923 and follow Amelia and her family on their excavations in Egypt with a few side adventures in other countries.\nIf you have only read some of the earlier books, I'd encourage you to read the later ones, when Amelia's son Ramses begins to play a larger role in the books.

Crocodile on the Sandbank (1884-1885)\n02... Curse of the Pharaohs (1892-1893)\n03... The Mummy Case (1894-1895) - Thanks to Silverraven.\n04... Lion in the Valley (1895-1896)\n05...

Seeing a Large Cat (1903-1904) - Thanks to Bookywoody.\n`Seeing a Large Cat` begins an internal quartet (which also includes `The Ape Who Guards the Balance`, `The Falcon at the Portal` and 'He Shall Thunder in the Sky').\nThe quartet comprises not only Amelia's diary of those years but also parts of a mysterious &quot;Manuscript H,&quot; an omniscient viewpoint that allows a glimpse into the minds\nof Amelia's son--the dashing and brilliant Ramses--and her ward, Nefret Forth, as they mature into adults with their own secrets and agendas.\n'The Falcon at the Portal' left readers hanging impatiently in the enormous rift that book's events gouged between Ramses and Nefret, both madly in love but unrelentingly proud.\n10...

She had put up a very tough battle against cancer for over a decade, in a style worthy of Amelia. She preferred not to be fussed over, and so did not make her illness public. She died as she had told everyone she wanted to - unexpectedly, in her sleep. Shortly before her death, she had written a line to be posted on her webpage: &quot;At 85, Elizabeth Peters is enjoying her cats, her garden, lots of chocolate, and not nearly enough gin!&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c397decca2a96944f695e62c1de53888cbd65ec","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Amelia+Peabody+Egyptian+Mystery+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c397decca2a96944f695e62c1de53888cbd65ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,57,125,236,202,42,150,148,79,105,94,98,193,222,83,136,140,189,101,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
