This includes the correct positioning of crossovers, junctions and the removal of miles of redundant track.\n\nAdditional markers throughout the route enable more specific scenario creation. You can replicate a situation where a train has failed on the route, for example, and your AI workings would take the bi-directional route instead.\n\nMajor renovation of the Ferryhill and Tursdale area, including the new layout, scenery additions and improvements at Metal Bridge, the relaying of Ferryhill yard and reduced emphasis on the now redundant rail operations at Ferryhill quarry.\n\nFull and accurate speed limits to the current route specification.\n\nThe route is fully signalled, including AWS, TPWS and bi-directional operations.\n\nUpdated scenery placement, including trackside foliage, provides a substantial improvement in frame rates.\n\nBridges and gantries have been raised where possible, to enable the electrification to pass underneath.\n\nCustom objects and landmarks such as the Newcastle Gateshead Millennium Bridge, Angel of the North, Sage Centre and the York wheel reflect the area in its modern state.\n\nNewcastle station and surrounding track has been remodelled to reflect its appearance in 2009,  including the up-to-date allocation of platform numbers, the removal of old platforms and the addition of new ones.\n\nYork station has been remodelled to the same high standard as Newcastle, including a reworking of the surrounding track.\n\nDarlington station and the surrounding area have been remodelled to include Platform 4a, the new college buildings and the adjacent rail depot. Redundant track around the station has been removed.\n\nChester-le-Street, Durham, Northallerton &amp; Thirsk stations have also been fully updated, with lengthened platforms where appropriate, custom signs, updated station furniture and improvements to the overall look of the station and access area.\n\nThe line has been extended to Darlington North Road, birthplace of 60163 Tornado, to enable further scenario opportunities.\n\nTyne Yard has been fully remodelled, including the removal of the south end of the yard as well as updated track placement.\n\nLow Fell yard has been removed and replaced with the postal Mail depot and loading area to further enable scenario opportunities.\n\n\nINCLUDED REPAINTS\n\nHST: Great North Eastern Railway GNER (blue with red stripe)\nHST: National Express East Coast NXEC (blue with white stripe - transitional livery)\nHST: National Express East Coast NXEC (grey/white - current livery)\nHST: Cross Country (silver/pink/brown mauve - current livery)\nRail Express Systems RES 47 and Mk1 coaches (faded/weathered)\n\nSCENARIOS\n\nA varied selection of eight scenarios will provide the ideal opportunity to explore this exciting route in both RailWorks and Rail Simulator.\n\nEaglescliffe Diversions - Part 1\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s summer 2009 and due to weekend engineering works at Darlington, ECML traffic is to be diverted between Northallerton and Ferryhill via Eaglescliffe &amp; Stockton. You are required to take charge of 1S13 London Kings Cross to Aberdeen service starting at York at 13:06 and taking the service through to Newcastle with only Durham as an interim stop. In Part 1 of this scenario you will travel from York to the Yarm line north-east of Northallerton before following the instructions to load up Part 2.\n\nEaglescliffe Diversions - Part 2\nContinuing on from Part 1, you are required to proceed north and stop at Durham before heading onwards to Newcastle where you will hand over to another driver for the next part of the service.\n\nGreat North Run\nYou must take an additional service for the Great North Run from Newcastle to York utilising a National Express HST.\n\nTranspennine Express\nDriving a slightly late-running Transpennine Express service from Northallerton to York.\n\nTornado Tribute\nWith the inaugural run of the Tornado only a week away, a steam special has been organised from Darlington North Road to York utilising a Black 5 locomotive.\n\nWest Country Mail\nDrive RES 47726 from Low Fell to York with a Plymouth-bound mail train. It is Spring 1997 and evidence of privatisation can be seen with the GNER livery already applied to many of their HSTs. Virgin, however, have been much slower on the uptake with Intercity Swallow still dominating.\n\nWensleydale Convoy\nTow two Class 47s with 55022 from Newcastle to the Wensleydale railway at Northallerton for their annual diesel gala.\n\nCross Country HST Comeback\nIt's 2009, and who would have thought that HSTs would return to Cross Country after being ousted by the Voyager units in 2003? You are in control of a newly refurbished set where you will run from Newcastle to York.\n\n\nEnjoy and seeedddd!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c4effef267bfe4f144e12c8164044c863aba8ab","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+Just+trains+Newcastle+to+York+-+Modern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c4effef267bfe4f144e12c8164044c863aba8ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,78,255,239,38,123,254,79,20,78,18,200,22,64,68,200,99,171,168,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
