The band has undergone several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the same Jefferson Starship name. The current Jefferson Starship, led by co-founder Paul Kantner, more closely resembles its original mix of psychedelic and electric folk music than the pop-driven tunes it was widely known for in the early to mid-1980s. It is not to be confused with Starship, a spin-off of the group featuring former co-lead singer Mickey Thomas that also periodically tours. The latter group is most frequently identified with the 1980s pop tunes of Jefferson Starship","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5771d68a954a213cffd3eccb15c3092fc7cbce","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Starship%2FLive+In+Central+Park+NYC%5B2CD%5D%5B1975%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5771d68a954a213cffd3eccb15c3092fc7cbce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,87,113,214,138,149,74,33,60,255,211,236,203,21,195,9,47,199,203,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
