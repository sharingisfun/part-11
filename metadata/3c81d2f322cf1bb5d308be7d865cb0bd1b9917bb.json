IS CONSCIOUSNESS \nIMPRINTING THE ATOM, OUR DNA, AND OUR WORLD WITH A CODE THAT PREVENTS US FROM \nMOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, SEQUESTERING HUMANITY ON ONE PLANET IN \nA HUGE UNIVERSE, ATTAINING ENLIGHTENMENT, ENDING WAR, CONQUERING DISEASE, OLD \nAGE AND DEATH? Is SINGULARITY the long awaited Code Breaker? FIND OUT NOW! \nAFTER YOU READ THIS FASCINATING BOOK, \\&amp;#039;SINGULARITY,\\&quot; YOU WILL NEVER BE THE \nSAME AGAIN. THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE THE SECRET TO BREAK THE CODE ON ALL \nHUMAN LIMITATIONS!\n\nAdam and Eve were banished from the proverbial Garden of Eden for partaking \nof the forbidden fruit of the ÃƒÂ´Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.ÃƒÂ¶ This \nis the poisonous duality that would cause them to fall from Grace, but also \nbe the cause of all War, Disease, Death, and worst of all, the cause of all \nhuman limitation. \n\nIn this book we will examine the Three Major Forms of Inertia that human \nbeings experience: Good and Evil would be the root cause of three major forms \nof inertia: 1. The Psychological Inertia that results in Conflict, Violence \nand War, 2. The Inertia of movement, that we would be trapped in the fabric \nof space-time and not be able to move faster than the speed of light \n(EinsteinÃƒâ€ s Law). 3. The Cellular Inertia that causes aging, disease and \ndeath. All of these three forms of inertia were prophesy in the Bible book of \nGenesis when God warned Adam and Eve not to partake of the Knowledge of Good \nand Evil. \n\nBut when we get to understand the root cause of all inertia, only then will \nwe be able to perceive the great ÃƒÂ´Singularity,ÃƒÂ¶ our greatest potential \nLiberation. With Singularity, we can firstly End all Violence and War, if we \ncan all agree to collectively perceive it, and use it as a transformational \ntool. Secondly, we could attain instantaneous movement of information, \ncommunications and actual space travel anywhere in the universe, in zero \ntime. This would be the greatest achievement for our Total Evolution. The \nFreedom to move anywhere. But even more fascinating than movement, we could \nactually see the first Real Time picture of our universe; a picture that the \nvery slow speed of light prevents us from seeing. Finally, we can end all \ndisease and death. We could actually attain eternal life, rather than wait \nfor it to be granted by some higher power outside of ourselves.\n\n\n\nCoast to Coast AM: Wednesday September 27th, 2006 \n\nHost:\nGeorge Noory\n\nGuests:\nDavid B.

He also presented highlights of his \nresearch regarding NASA UFO footage. \n\nSereda refuted NASA\\&amp;#039;s contention that objects seen outside the Shuttle are \n\\&quot;space junk,\\&quot; saying that the UFOs captured on video (such as one he \ndescribed as looking like a \\&quot;golden mean rectangle\\&quot;) are much further away \nthan debris which would appear smaller. He also agreed with the notion that \nNASA has a dual space program, and cited reports of \\&quot;giant triangles\\&quot; seen \neast of Riverside County, which he said may be made by Lockheed Martin. \n\nThe germination for his new book Singularity came from a visitation he said \nhe received from a \\&quot;powerful being of light\\&quot; in 1994, in which he was given a \nset of teachings that he later cross referenced in current science and \nancient texts. Humanity suffers from three forms of inertia brought on by \nduality, but by experiencing singularity or oneness, we can surmount these \nlimitations and begin interstellar travel, he outlined. \n\n\nDavid Sereda - Ancient of Days 2004 lecture\n\n(http://www.alienresistance.org/aod2004dvds.htm ORDER FULL CONFERENCE DVD SET \nFOR $49 OR FOR $20 EACH)\n\n\nWidth x Height: 352 x 240 xvid \nDuration: 1:34:35\nBit rate - audio format: 123kbps - mp3\nSize: 419,731,456 bytes   \n\n\n*Ancient of Days 2004 - David Sereda goes over some of the information from \nhis first book and film \\&amp;#039;The Case for Nasa UFOs\\&amp;#039; as well as discusses alot of \nnew information and theories regarding alternative energy technology, and new \nUFO video from the Mexican military of objects that were detected by radar \nand caught on infrared video, but invisible to the eye, that Jaime Maussan \nbrought to the media having called for an international press conference; \nDavid explains in depth the physics of how these UFOs must operate while \ngoing unnoticed to the human eye and the implications of the ultraviolet \nspectrum.  Sereda also discusses his intriguing new theory about the elusive \nRoswell crash as it relates to the first atomic test that was detonated at \nthe Trinity site: White Sands Missile Range near Alamogordo, New Mexico in \nJuly 1945.*  \n\nRecorded and distributed by Lost Arts Media -----&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lostartsmedia.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lostartsmedia.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n|  Archived and seeded by !UtopiAted!Net!   ||    &lt;a href=&quot; http://utopiated.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://utopiated.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c81d2f322cf1bb5d308be7d865cb0bd1b9917bb","amp;dn":"David+Sereda+-+Singularity+and+UFOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c81d2f322cf1bb5d308be7d865cb0bd1b9917bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,129,210,243,34,207,27,181,211,8,190,125,134,92,176,189,27,153,23,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
