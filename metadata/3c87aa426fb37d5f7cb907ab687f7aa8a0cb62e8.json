Nightshift won a Grammy (The Commodores only) but the rest of the songs stand for themselves as great work. A good, clean, old skool 80&amp;#039;s R&amp;B-Funk album.\n\nIt is here in both FLAC and HQ MP3, with a silly album cover.\n\n\nTRACKS:\n   1. &quot;Animal Instinct&quot;\n   2. &quot;Nightshift&quot;\n   3. &quot;I Keep Running&quot;\n   4. &quot;Lay Back&quot;\n   5. &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot;\n   6. &quot;Play This Record Twice&quot;\n   7. &quot;Janet&quot;\n   8. &quot;Woman in My Life&quot;\n   9. &quot;Lighting Up The Night&quot;\n\n\nListen to it all and you&amp;#039;ll be surprised, but the title song, &quot;Nightshift&quot; is worth the download in itself.\n\nRegards.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c87aa426fb37d5f7cb907ab687f7aa8a0cb62e8","amp;dn":"The+Commodores+-+Nightshift++%28FLAC%2FMP3+HQ+Vinyl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c87aa426fb37d5f7cb907ab687f7aa8a0cb62e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,135,170,66,111,179,125,95,124,185,7,171,104,127,122,168,160,203,98,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
