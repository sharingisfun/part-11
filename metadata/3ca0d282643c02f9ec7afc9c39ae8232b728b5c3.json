The retail version of this will run you about $30, and it includes a nice pamphlet of extra information about the Battle.  The pamphlet includes the map of the tour route, but you can just go to this site for a PDF of it: http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/upload/GETT%20brochure.pdf\n\nI found the tour to be very interesting, and it is well worth your time!\n\nI hope you enjoy it and learn a lot! If you can, please support the town of Gettysburg and the preservation of the Battlefields.\n\n\nI'll be seeding this from my laptop that isn't always on, so just sit tight for a bit and I'll make sure to get it to you as soon as I can :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca0d282643c02f9ec7afc9c39ae8232b728b5c3","amp;dn":"The+Gettysburg+Story+-+Battlefield+Auto+Tour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca0d282643c02f9ec7afc9c39ae8232b728b5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,160,210,130,100,60,2,249,236,122,252,156,57,174,130,50,183,40,181,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
