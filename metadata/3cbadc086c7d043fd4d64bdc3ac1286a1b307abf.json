There are profiles of players past and present - Bradman, Ranjitsinhji, Benaud and Sobers from the past, Steve Waugh, Shane Warne and Wasim Akram from the present. He covers the big issues in the game: sledging, match-fixing, Kerry Packer, Zimbabwe, umpiring. He writes about cricket's best writers - Swanton, C.L.R. James - and ponders the game's most halcyon and unique aspects: slow bowling, captaincy, the essence of good batting. Haigh has now established himself as one of the finest writers on the game - author of one acknowledged masterpiece, Mystery Spinner, a comic classic, Many a Slip - and one of its most most shrewd commentators, who gets widely reviewed both by the cricket media and the national press. This book is likely to attract the same attention","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbadc086c7d043fd4d64bdc3ac1286a1b307abf","amp;dn":"Game+for+Anything%3A+Writings+on+Cricket+-+Gideon+Haigh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbadc086c7d043fd4d64bdc3ac1286a1b307abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,186,220,8,108,125,4,63,212,214,75,220,58,193,40,106,27,48,122,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
