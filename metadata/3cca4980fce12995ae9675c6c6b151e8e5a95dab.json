It is the second part of a planned trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell, the powerful minister in the court of King Henry VIII. Bring Up the Bodies won the 2012 Man Booker Prize and the 2012 Costa Book of the Year. Preceded by Wolf Hall, it is to be followed by The Mirror and the Light.\n\nBring Up the Bodies begins where the previous novel finished. The King and Master Secretary Thomas Cromwell are the guests of the Seymour family at Wolf Hall. The King shares private moments with Jane Seymour, and begins to fall in love with her. His present queen, Anne Boleyn, has failed to give him a male heir and, as rumours of her infidelity spread, the King seeks a way to be rid of her, and marry the new object of his affections.\nAnne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell owe their current high status to each other. They become pitted against each other, as Cromwell seeks to find a legitimate excuse to expel her from the King's court. Cromwell, master politician, uses Anne's fall from grace as a chance to settle scores with old enemies. The book ends with the death of Anne.\n\nBRING UP THE BODIES Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2012\nBook Language: English \nFile Type: epub, mobi, pdf, doc\nFile Size: 16.5 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cca4980fce12995ae9675c6c6b151e8e5a95dab","amp;dn":"BRING+UP+THE+BODIES+by+Hilary+Mantel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cca4980fce12995ae9675c6c6b151e8e5a95dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,202,73,128,252,225,41,149,174,150,117,198,198,177,81,232,229,169,93,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
