Clark and Charles Menefee III, inspired by the &quot;thin shacks and sheds of insubstantial beauty&quot; of the Southern vernacular building tradition, are known for structures that are at once modest, rigorous, and economical in detail. They blend the ease and informality of the architecture of the historic south with the elegance of end-of-the-century modernism. This monograph of 13 projects - eight built, five unbuilt - reveals the architects' ideas and intentions while reflecting the spirit they bring to each design. Projects such as Middleton Inn, Croffead House, Lucy Daniels Foundation, Charleston Bus Stops, and 8 Bedon's Alley are presented through duotone photographs and drawings, which exemplify the simplicity and rigor of the architect's work. The author's critical analysis of each project highlights associations to vernacular buildings and the local historic context.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cfb31924517ff9d1e7bf312cbd2038c17600302","amp;dn":"Clark+and+Menefee+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cfb31924517ff9d1e7bf312cbd2038c17600302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,251,49,146,69,23,255,157,30,123,243,18,203,210,3,140,23,96,3,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
