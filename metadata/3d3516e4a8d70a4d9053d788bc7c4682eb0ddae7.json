Of course that is pretty common since it seems my taste run counter to the mainstream. \n\nJohn from Cincinnati is about a washed-up surfer family grapple with the mysterious John's apocalyptic warnings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this might be the most wonderfully weird drama since Twin Peaks.\n\nJohn from Cincinnati is set against the surfing community of Imperial Beach, California, that aired on HBO from June 10, 2007 to August 12, 2007. It is the result of a collaborative effort between writer/producer David Milch and author Kem Nunn, whose novels have been termed surf noir.The program deals with a strange young man of mysterious origin and the effect he has on a dysfunctional family of professional surfers and their community.\n\nThe series includes surfing sequences by well-respected surfers such as Brock Little, Keala Kennelly, Dan Malloy, John-John Florence, Shane Beschen, and Herbie Fletcher.\n\nThe series' theme song is &quot;Johnny Appleseed,&quot; performed by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. A diverse soundtrack includes &quot;Tic&quot; by Kava Kava and songs from TV on the Radio, Muse, Buddy Guy, Kasabian and the Yardbirds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3516e4a8d70a4d9053d788bc7c4682eb0ddae7","amp;dn":"John+from+Cincinnati+%5BDVD-MKV+2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3516e4a8d70a4d9053d788bc7c4682eb0ddae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,53,22,228,168,215,10,77,144,83,215,136,188,124,70,130,235,13,218,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
