With its problem-oriented clinical approach, the book presents relevant topics of current importance to the practicing clinician rather than providing a comprehensive review of all technical and basic science aspects.\nAn initial section covers the broad principles and scope of important areas that are considered to have impacted more significantly on current and future clinical practice since the last edition. The second section covers all the clinical systems where nuclear medicine helps current clinical practice, while a third section covers a number of relevant technical topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d360ced7b3f4f7c0906b8c8b8849d7202dde402","amp;dn":"Clinical+Nuclear+Medicine+4th+Edition-A+Hodder+Arnold+Publicatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d360ced7b3f4f7c0906b8c8b8849d7202dde402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,54,12,237,123,63,79,124,9,6,184,200,184,132,157,114,2,221,228,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
