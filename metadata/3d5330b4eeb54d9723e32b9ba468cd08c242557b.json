Artificial gravity, which would replace terrestrial gravity with inertial forces generated by rotating the transit vehicle or by short-radius human centrifuge devices within the transit vehicle or surface habitat, has long been considered a potential solution. However, despite its attractiveness as an efficient, multi-system countermeasure and its potential for improving the environment and simplifying operational activities, much still needs to be learned regarding the human response to rotating environments before artificial gravity can be successfully implemented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d5330b4eeb54d9723e32b9ba468cd08c242557b","amp;dn":"Artificial+Gravity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d5330b4eeb54d9723e32b9ba468cd08c242557b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,83,48,180,238,181,77,151,35,227,43,155,164,104,205,8,194,66,85,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
