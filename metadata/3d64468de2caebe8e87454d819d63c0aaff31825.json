Battered by repeated invasions from their aggressive neighborsÃ¢â‚¬â€Celt, Roman, and NorseÃ¢â‚¬â€the Albans fled west. Their search for safety, and for the massive walrus herds on which their survival depended, eventually took them to the land now known as Newfoundland and Labrador. Skillfully weaving together clues gathered from forty years of research, Mowat presents a fascinating account of a forgotten history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d64468de2caebe8e87454d819d63c0aaff31825","amp;dn":"The+Farfarers+by+Farley+Mowat+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d64468de2caebe8e87454d819d63c0aaff31825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,100,70,141,226,202,235,232,232,116,84,216,25,214,60,10,175,243,24,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
