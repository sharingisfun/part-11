In this practical and authoritative handbook, the separation of proteins, nucleic acids, and oligonucleotides from biological matrices is covered from analytical to process scales. Also included in a chapter on the separation of monoclonal antibodies, which have found numerous uses as therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Analytical techniques include an interesting montage of chromatographic methods, capillary electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and mass spectrometry. Among separation and purification methods, liquid-liquid distribution, displacement chromatography, expanded bed adsorption, membrane chromatography, and simulated moving bed chromatography are covered at length. Regulatory and economic considerations are addressed, as are plant and process equipment and engineering process control. A chapter on future developments highlights the application of DNA chip arrays as well as evolving methodologies for a large number of drugs that are under development for treatment of cancer, AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Handbook of Bioseparations serves as an essential reference and guidebook for separation scientists working in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, academia, and government laboratories.\n\nKey Features\n* Covers bioseparations of proteins, nucleic acids, and monoclonal antibodies\n* Encompasses both analytical and process-scale methods\n* Elucidates the importance of engineering process control\n* Details selection of plant and process equipment\n* Addresses economic considerations\n* Discusses future developments\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3daa4cce6c272734cfc6151e78de782d32d36ab1","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2000%5D+Handbook+of+Bioseparations+%28Separation+Science+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3daa4cce6c272734cfc6151e78de782d32d36ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,170,76,206,108,39,39,52,207,198,21,30,120,222,120,45,50,211,106,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
