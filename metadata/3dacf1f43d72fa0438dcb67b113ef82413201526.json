And in this book, Julie Owen presents a charming collection of miniature bears, each less than 5 inches tall. Readers will find step-by-step instructions for 10 different projects, along with a wealth of bear costume ideas for a variety of occasions, including birthdays, Halloween, Valentine's Day and more. All the bears are pictured with color photographs, including a picnic scene that's bound to inspire any bear-lover. Julie K. Owen first became interested in miniature bear making in 1992. In 1996, she launched her own business, The Great British Bear Company, selling gift-boxed miniature bear kits that she designs and produces. She also regularly teaches bear-making workshops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dacf1f43d72fa0438dcb67b113ef82413201526","amp;dn":"%5BSEWING%5D+Making+and+Dressing+Miniature+Teddy+Bears","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dacf1f43d72fa0438dcb67b113ef82413201526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,172,241,244,61,114,250,4,56,220,182,123,17,62,248,36,19,32,21,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
