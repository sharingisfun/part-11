This brand new, Canadian co-produced, two-part miniseries premieres on CBC Television on Easter Sunday, April 4 at 8 p.m. and concludes on Sunday, April 11 at 8 p.m.\n\nJoseph Morgan (Alexander, Master and Commander) stars as Judah Ben Hur and Stephen Campbell Moore (Amazing Grace, The History Boys) is Octavius Messala, life-long friends on the opposite sides of a war for JudaeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s national identity that tests their characters to the maximum.\n\nThe stellar international cast also includes Emily VanCamp (Brothers &amp; Sisters, Everwood) as Esther, Hugh Bonneville (Notting Hill, Mansfield Park) as Pontius Pilate, Ray Winstone (Beowulf, The Departed) as Quintus Arrius, James Faulkner (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, The Good Shepherd) as Marcellus Agrippa, Alex Kingston (ER, Law &amp; Order: SUV) as Ruth, Kristin Kreuk (Smallville) as Tirzah, Lucia Jimenez (Butterflies and Lightning) as Athene, Ben Cross (Star Trek, Chariots of Fire) as Emperor Tiberius and Kris Holden-Reid (The Tudors, Waking Up Wally: The Walter Gretzky Story) as Gaius.\n\nBEN HUR is a universal, timeless story of a man wrongfully condemned, who becomes an outsider fighting for his identity and survival, gaining revenge and finding his true self again. While the story mirrors the famous 1959 eleven-time Academy Award-winning jewel, starring Charlton Heston, this BEN HUR offers a new dimension, recreating the classical world and its gritty spectacle and psychodrama. Filmed in Morocco this time, instead of a back lot, the production takes viewers to 1st century Jerusalem, a seething, restless melting pot at the end of the Silk Road and the edge of the Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This part (the second half) is 90:30 in duration and aired on CBC on April 11, 2010.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd42099ee913392650af43c32ede5c6ac2baf88","amp;dn":"Ben.Hur.2010.CBC.Part.2.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd42099ee913392650af43c32ede5c6ac2baf88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,212,32,153,238,145,51,146,101,10,244,60,50,237,229,198,172,43,175,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
