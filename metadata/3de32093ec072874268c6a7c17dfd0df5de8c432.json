The entire series was released on DVD as The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour: The Complete Series on Tuesday, March 7, 2006. However, the episodes contained therein are not the original 1976 broadcast versions, but the separate syndicated versions of The Scooby-Doo Show and Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.\n\nThese are all 16 episodes from the DVD release and are labeled according to the names of the individual Scooby Doo and Dynomutt segments. I also included the special features: &quot;Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History,&quot; and &quot;In Their Own Words.&quot; As with all my torrents, I have included muxed English subtitles.
