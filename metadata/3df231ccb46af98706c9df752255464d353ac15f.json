The Cat.  for the explicit is 2730473 if anyone wants\nto go pick buy it at shops... We went through hell figuring out where this\nexplicit exists so we figured we might save you the hassle of searching\nmonths... And if you want some hot artwork, we have 1200dpi scans available\non request (They total 300MB).\n\nThe other release has 3 tracks censored. Notably in Bad Romance at 02m29s,\nBecause Im a free bitch baby, Monster at 00m57s We might have fucked not\nreally sure, and Dance In The Dark at 00m40s, Baby Im a free bitch, among\nmany others.\n\nThanks Interscope for all this mess! Team VAG has now collectively bought\nthis album 5 times (and probably more...).\n\nMy personal favorites in this EP include So Happy I Could Die (pls2next\nsingle!!), Alejandro, the already singled out Bad Romance and Telephone, and\nMonster in that order :D.\n\nEnjoy the amazing Lady GaGa, she is really a legit artist...have you seen\nthis girl play piano? WOW! Not to mention her crafty lyrics...\n---\nInitially planned solely as a standard double-disc reissue in the wake of the\nblockbuster success of The Fame, Lady Gaga decided to release the new\nmaterial as a separate EP called The Fame Monster in addition to the standard\ntwo-CD set, where its tacked onto a now standardized version of her debut.\nIts a nice move for fans, plus it helps emphasize the new material, which\ndoes act as a bridge from the debut to a forthcoming full-length. Everything\non The Fame Monster bears a galvanized Eurotrash finish, as evident on the\nheavy steel synths of Bad Romance and the updated ABBA revision\nAlejandro, as it is on the rock &amp; roll ballad Speechless  its big\nguitars lifted from Noel Gallagher  and the wonderful, perverse march\nTeeth. Even the stuttering splices on Telephone, a duet with Beyonc,\nleans to the other side of the Atlantic, which just emphasizes the otherness\nthats become Gagas calling card. And even as shes becoming omnipresent,\nwith her songs mingling with those who co-opt her on the radio, she is still\nslightly skewed, willing to go so far over the top she goes beyond camp, yet\nstill channeling it through songs that are written, not just hooks. The Fame\nMonster builds upon those strengths exhibited on The Fame, offering a\ncredible expansion of the debut and suggesting shes not just a fleeting pop\nphenomenon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df231ccb46af98706c9df752255464d353ac15f","amp;dn":"Lady+GaGa-The+Fame+Monster-%28Explicit%29-2009-VAG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df231ccb46af98706c9df752255464d353ac15f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,242,49,204,180,106,249,135,6,201,223,117,34,85,70,77,53,58,193,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
