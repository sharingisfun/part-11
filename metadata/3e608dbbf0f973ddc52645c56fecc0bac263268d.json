It was filmed entirely on location in Wales\n\nIn Pre-England Britain, sometime before the birth of King Arthur, Merlin (Simon Lloyd Roberts) is already active and now serves under King Vortigern (Hefin Wyn).\n\nSoon after Vortigern's coronation, a large army of giant, fire-breathing dragons lands in Britain and begins to terrorize the land, setting fire to buildings and feasting on any who are unable to escape. Due to their size and number, the dragons threaten the very existence of Britain itself, and Vortigern instructs Merlin to lead an army against the dragons, ordering his best generalsÃ¢â‚¬â€Hengist (Iago McGuire) and Uther (Dylan Jones)Ã¢â‚¬â€to aid Merlin in any way possible.\n\nWith the help of Vortigern and his generals, Merlin begins to think of ways to defeat the dragons, who are growing stronger every day whilst Britain grows weaker. Using magic and knowledge, Merlin devises a plan that will ultimately decide the fate of British history.\n\nNia Ann - Lady Nimue\nCeri Bostock - Gwyneth\nCarys Eleri - Lady Vivianne\nRuthie Gwilym - Midwife\nWilliam Huw - Torm\nDylan Jones - Uther\nIago McGuire - Hengist\nJÃƒÂ¼rgen Prochnow - The Mage\nSimon Lloyd Roberts - Merlin\nJoseph Stacey - Vendiger\nIona Thonger - Ingraine\nHefin Wyn - Vortigern\n\nDirected by Mark Atkins\nProduced by David Michael Latt, David Rimawi and Paul Bales\nWritten by Jon Macy\nStarring: Nia Ann, Ceri Bostock,Carys Eleri and Ruthie Gwilym\nCinematography: Mark Atkins\nDistributed by The Asylum\nRelease date(s): November 25, 2008\nRunning time: 90 minutes\nCountry: United Kingdom and United States\nLanguage:\tEnglish-language\nBudget: $65.00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e608dbbf0f973ddc52645c56fecc0bac263268d","amp;dn":"Merlin+and+the+War+of+the+Dragons+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e608dbbf0f973ddc52645c56fecc0bac263268d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,96,141,187,240,249,115,221,197,38,69,197,111,236,192,186,194,99,38,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
