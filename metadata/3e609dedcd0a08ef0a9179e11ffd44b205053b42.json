Sucks! is a 2011 Hong Kong movie, directed by award-winning Hong Kong Chinese film producer Scud (Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung Ã¤Âºâ€˜Ã§Â¿â€). It was released at the 47th Chicago International Film Festival, in October 2011. It explores several themes traditionally regarded as 'taboo' in Hong Kong society, in an unusually open, convention-defying way, featuring frequent full-frontal male and female nudity, and is one of four such films by Scud. The three earlier ones are: City Without Baseball, released in 2008, Permanent Residence in 2009, and Amphetamine in 2010.\nContents\n\nPlot\n\nLove Actually... Sucks! was inspired by real-life events, and opens with a dramatic wedding feast. It tells a variety of stories about love that has gone wrong: a brother and sister in an illicit relationship, a married painter who falls in love with his young male life model, a dance school teacher who is besotted with his senior student, and a lesbian couple, one of whom has role-play paranoia, and is caught in a complex love triangle. The film celebrates the belief that life is love.\nStarring \tOsman Hung\nChristepher Wee\nLinda So\nHaze Leung\n\nHardcoded Eng sub and Chinese sub\n\nscreens:- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dBrQb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dBrQb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KlU3Y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KlU3Y.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e609dedcd0a08ef0a9179e11ffd44b205053b42","amp;dn":"Love.Actually.Sucks.2012.DVD-RMVB+%E7%88%B1%E5%BE%88%E7%83%82+Eng+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e609dedcd0a08ef0a9179e11ffd44b205053b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,96,157,237,205,10,8,239,10,145,121,225,31,253,68,178,5,5,59,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
