Millions have followed this path to greater sanity, balance, and well-being, often in the face of huge stress, pain, uncertainty, sorrow, and illness.\n\nIn his landmark book, Full Catastrophe Living, Jon Kabat-Zinn shared this innovative approach, known as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), with the world. Now, in this companion volume, 100 pointers from that groundbreaking work have been carefully selected to inspire you to embrace what is deepest and best and most beautiful in yourself.\n\nWhether you are trying to learn patience, cope with pain, deal with the enormous stress and challenges of the age we live in, improve your relationships, or free yourself from destructive emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, these deceptively simple meditations will remind you that you have deep inner resources to draw upon, the most important of which is the present moment itself. Regardless of your age or whether you are familiar with the healing power of mindfulness, this insightful, inspirational guide will help you to honor, embrace, learn from, and grow into each moment of your life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7777c21df9e0c5762d0bbd5c05ea7f76dbd1d0","amp;dn":"Letting+Everything+Become+Your+Teacher%3A+100+Lessons+in+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7777c21df9e0c5762d0bbd5c05ea7f76dbd1d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,119,119,194,29,249,224,197,118,45,11,189,92,5,234,127,118,219,209,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
