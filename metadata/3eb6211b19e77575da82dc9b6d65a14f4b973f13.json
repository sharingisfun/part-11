The once great nation has been torn apart by a decade of civil\nwar. The ten year war resulted in huge territorial gains for the Northern\nPeoples Republicand their controlling political party. This gave them\ncontrol of almost the entire country, except the oil-rich province in the\nSouth.\nThe southern Azbaristan Democratic Front has only managed to hold off the\nNorth with the aid of the West, which supplies military and logistical aid\nto the tiny state in return for oil exports. Players will assume the role\nof squadron leader Razor and lead the fight to reunify Azbaristan and\nprotect the West's vital interests.\nJ.A.S.F is an intense modern flight sim featuring 16 epic story based\nmissions that will take air combat to the next level. Engage enemies using\n30 authentic licensed fighters as you battle over expansive battlefields.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb6211b19e77575da82dc9b6d65a14f4b973f13","amp;dn":"JASF.Janes.Advanced.Strike.Fighters.XBOX360-COMPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb6211b19e77575da82dc9b6d65a14f4b973f13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,182,33,27,25,231,117,117,218,130,220,155,109,101,161,79,75,151,63,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
