A wave of anti-British passion is sweeping Bengal fanned by leaders such as Sandip (Soumitra Chatterjee). In the course of his political work, Sandip comes to the Estate of his friend Nikhil (Victor Bannerjee). Nikhil an aristocrat but progressive man, sympathises with the cause Sandip espouses but disapproves of the rabble rousing that Sandip does. At Nikhil's house, Sandip meets Bimala (Swatilekha Chattopadhyay), Nikhil's beautiful wife, who is encouraged by her husband to come out of strict purdah to meet Sandip. What starts as an intellectual discourse soon converts itself into a love triangle as Bimala is strongly attracted to Sandip. Then as the political events overtake them, their romantic involvement leads to tragic consequences.\n\n\nComments:\n---------\n\nRay had wanted to make a film out of Ghare Baire even before he had made Pather Panchali but couldn't find the necessary funding until he had made a name for himself. When he did succeed, he was struck down by ill-health and so the film is almost entirely shot indoors. The film therefore could only have limited dramatic events. The drama is created in the interplay of characters and ideas. The romance of Sandip and Bimala is probably only a secondary element. The real story in Ray's adaptation of Tagore's novel is the conflict of ideas and that makes the film move at a somewhat slow pace. As the ideas and emotions intermingle with each other, an impasse develops, that can only be resolved through tragedy.\n\nI love the slow development of each character. The heroic Sandip with his animal magnetism and fiery politics is counterposed by the laid back Nikhil, who believes in reason and logic and progress rather than mass movements. Bimala, the bored housewife in purdah, is dazzled by the eloquence and the animal spirit of Sandip, yet cannot completely ignore her quiet and rational husband. And then as events gather pace, teverything turns out to be different from what it seemed. Sandip who spoke against the Hindu-Muslim divide created by the British ends up fanning communal riots. The indecisive Nikhil fianlly takes a stand, but it is too late. Bimala learns the truth, only to lose both men.\n\nThe lack of action scenes clearly is the reason for the widespread criticism of the slow pace of the film. I have always believed that this was ill-informed criticism. For the picturisation of the clash of ideas and the development of each character is masterly. It is a philosophical film which needed the slow development. If anything I have a difference with the original Tagore tale, repeated in the film. It seems to decry the liberal philosophy of Nikhil and the emancipation of women. It seems to say that a sudden freedom given to women is a recipe for disastrous decisions by them. I have never agreed with this depiction by Ray and watching the film, I was again conscious of the same feeling of disappointment.\n\nTechnically, this is one of Ray's best. Despite all indooer shots, the narrative is allowed to develop at what seems a natural pace and credit for this must go to Dulal Dutta, the editor. Photography is outstanding and the attention to detail, even to the exrtent of the kind of internal decor, is breathtaking. The three major actors, Saumitra, Swatilakha and Victor Banerjee do a very good job. In particular I liked Victor Bannerjee as Nikhil. In some shots, Saumitra's Sandip  looked a bit too old to be the classmate of Victor Bannerjee's Nikhil. Expected, given the difference in age of the two actors. \n\nThis is a film to watch when you are in a pensive mood and when you are in a mood to appreciate the clash of ideas. You won't like it if you are fond of the bollywood action movies.\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\n-----------------\n\nToday is Satyajit Ray's Birth Anniversary and I would like to place this film in your hands as my tribute to the master. \n\nI have long wished for a good DVD of this film and we must be grateful to Criterion/Eclipse for providing it. The rip tries to make the colors a little more vivid and vibrant and increases the frame size to 720x544 from the original 656x480. It deliberately avoids doing much else. The discerning will also notice the use of grain in this rip. It was there in the original and has been carefully retained. The sound is monoaural as it was in the original film.\n\n\nIMDB Link:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087328/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087328/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSample:\n-----------\n\nRipper:\n-------\ndebpk77","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f07c32411ca51a11debac0440f02e103add2146","amp;dn":"GHARE+BAIRE-Criterion%28Eclipse%29-X264.AAC-Bangla.ESubs-1GB-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f07c32411ca51a11debac0440f02e103add2146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,7,195,36,17,202,81,161,29,235,172,4,64,240,46,16,58,221,33,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
