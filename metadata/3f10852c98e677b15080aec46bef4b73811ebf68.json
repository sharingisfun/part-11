The film deconstructs the administration&amp;#039;s case for war through interviews with U.S intelligence and defense officials, foreign service experts, and U.N. weapons inspectors -- including a former CIA director, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and even President Bush&amp;#039;s Secretary of the Army. Their analyses and conclusions are sobering, and often disturbing, regardless of one&amp;#039;s political affiliations. \n\nSince this film was first released in November 2003 via thousands of house parties organized by MoveOn.org, the issues addressed have become well known, and the arguments made by the experts in the film have been proven. Most recently, by the Downing Street Memos. \n\nThis is an important film documenting exactly how the Bush administration hoodwinked the American people into supporting an unnecessary war. A war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives, and continues today. \n\n\n\nFor more information or to purchase this video, please visit: http://www.truthuncovered.com/\n\n\nRun Time: 83 minutes\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f10852c98e677b15080aec46bef4b73811ebf68","amp;dn":"Uncovered+-+The+War+In+Iraq+%5BAVI+-+Conspiracy+-+Sept+11th+-+911+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f10852c98e677b15080aec46bef4b73811ebf68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,16,133,44,152,230,119,177,80,128,174,196,107,239,75,115,129,30,191,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
