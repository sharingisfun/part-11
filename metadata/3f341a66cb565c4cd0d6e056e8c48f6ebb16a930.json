Accompanied by Charlotte, a naive European journalist, Ferrer discovers a village under fire from mysterious agents of the foreign-backed government. Ferrer and Charlotte must fight not only to protect the preserve, but to expose government corruption Ã¢â‚¬â€ and survive to see another day.\n\nBorn in 1938, Hermanns childhood was marked by WWII and the early need to earn a living on his own. He tried various professions and studied fine arts in Belgium, but he didn''t get into comic books until later in life when his first story was published in a magazine. In 1979 he started his first solo volume, Jeremiah, which he continues publishing today. He is known to be a hard-working, demanding writer constantly attempting new things. His works include Comanche and Towers of Bois-Maury among others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f341a66cb565c4cd0d6e056e8c48f6ebb16a930","amp;dn":"Hermann+-+Africa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f341a66cb565c4cd0d6e056e8c48f6ebb16a930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,52,26,102,203,86,92,76,208,214,224,86,232,196,143,110,187,22,169,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
