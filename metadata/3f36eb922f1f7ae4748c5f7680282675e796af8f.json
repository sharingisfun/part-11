In 1995, aged just 21, Keith Fennell was accepted into the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, the SAS. Over the next 11 years, operations took him from the jungles of East Timor to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan, from the southern Indian Ocean to Iraq. What he learned about friendship, and about himself, changed him forever. Fennell's missions forced him to stare death in the face many times. From dodging mines and bullets in Iraq's Anbar province to assisting the recovery effort after the Asian tsunami, his experiences are shocking and confronting - but also inspiring. An unflinching look inside the action and the fear, the tragedy and the bravery of one soldier's service in the Australian SAS, WARRIOR BROTHERS is also an edge-of-your-seat adrenaline ride with a group of men you will never forget.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Brothers-Life-Australian-SAS/dp/1741667941&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Brothers-Life-Australian-SAS/dp/1741667941&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f36eb922f1f7ae4748c5f7680282675e796af8f","amp;dn":"Warrior+Brothers%3A+My+Life+in+the+Australian+SAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f36eb922f1f7ae4748c5f7680282675e796af8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,54,235,146,47,31,122,228,116,140,95,118,128,40,38,117,231,150,175,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
