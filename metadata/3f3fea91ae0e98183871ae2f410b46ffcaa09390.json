In a series of 500 nearly wordless, highly informative step-by-step procedurals, readers learn how to do hundreds of useful (and fascinating and important and sometimes downright bizarre) tasks, including: Perform CPR, dance the tango, pack a suitcase, win a bar bet, play the blues, make authentic sushi rolls, fight a shark . . . and 493 more essentials of modern life. Packed with useful hands-on reference material, Show Me How is a work of art that just happens to also be an indispensable real-life resource","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3fea91ae0e98183871ae2f410b46ffcaa09390","amp;dn":"500+Things+You+Should+Know+-+Instructions+for+Life+%5BOCR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3fea91ae0e98183871ae2f410b46ffcaa09390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,63,234,145,174,14,152,24,56,113,174,47,65,11,70,255,202,160,147,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
