Their success \nled to many more albums in which they composed, arranged, and sang \nthe music.\n\nThe De Angelis brothers were among the most prolific Italian musi-\ncians of the 1970s. In fact, they were forced to use different names \nfor many of their projects to avoid over-saturating the market. One \nof these was Oliver Onions, which eventually became the name they \nwere mostly identified with.\n\nAlthough they released many standalone albums, it is for their \nsoundtrack work for which the De Angelis brothers are best known. Out \nof their many scores, undoubtedly the most famous and popular are \nthose composed for the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer comedies. Their \nsong &quot;Dune Buggy&quot; for the film Watch Out, We're Mad reached the top \nof the charts in Europe.\n\nThey are also known for their work on animated series, having com-\nposed original songs for Italian-dubbed anime (such as Doraemon, \nAshita no Joe and Galaxy Express 999) and European series (such as \nAround the World with Willy Fog).\n\nThey made music also for title song of Sandokan serie, which was \nbased on the novel E. Salgari.\n\nThey are also famous for writing and composing the themes to Dogta-\nnian and the Three Muskehounds and Bobobobs.\n\nIn November 2007, they gave their first concert in 25 years at the \nLucca Comics Festival.\n\nTheir theme for Zorro (1974), &quot;Zorro Is Back,&quot; was featured in Wes \nAnderson's Bottle Rocket.\n\n(wiki)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         ...:::pitybÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡:::...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNFO generated on.....: 2010.01.10. 16:43:54","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f45a548bc789878be02596a85f9f7fed7429cc9","amp;dn":"Oliver_Onions-Best_Of_Bud_Spencer_%26_Terence_Hill-%28SIL_5106-2%29-CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f45a548bc789878be02596a85f9f7fed7429cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,69,165,72,188,120,152,120,190,2,89,106,133,249,247,254,215,66,156,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
