C. Hitchcock, &quot;Disbelief 101: A Young Person's Guide to Atheism&quot;\n\nISBN: 1884365477 | 2009 | EPUB | 112 pages | 591 KB\n\nFilled with wit, humor, and clear metaphor, this exploration into atheism is written specifically for young adults, though any adult interested in learning more about atheism will find value within. Not just focused on atheism, this crash course in logical thinking addresses the issues of indoctrination, whether it be religious, political, or commercial, and makes the case that morality is created through reasoning and logic, not through divine communication. Many hot topics are touched upon, such as traditional arguments for GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence, the relationship of evolution and religious belief, the incompatible nature of science and religion, and the harmfulness of both Christianity and Islam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fa246baf8099589ed873e428b21ad81d1d337da","amp;dn":"Disbelief+101%3A+A+Young+Person%27s+Guide+to+Atheism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fa246baf8099589ed873e428b21ad81d1d337da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,162,70,186,248,9,149,137,237,135,62,66,139,33,173,129,209,211,55,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
