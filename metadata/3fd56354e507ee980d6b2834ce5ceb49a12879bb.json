If her aim sounds worthy but academic, don't be put off. Levy is one of the finest singers in the Middle East, and deserves global recognition. She has a gently exquisite and emotional style, and can tackle anything from a traditional Ladino song of longing for Jerusalem, to a Bedouin melody (in which she says she sees &quot;the beauty of Islam&quot;), pained love songs, or her own thoughtful ballads of struggle and hope. The backing for all this matches flamenco-influenced guitar with instruments like the oud, ney flute or qanoun, normally associated with Arabic music. It's a powerful, passionate and intriguing set.\n-- The Guardian\n\nTracks\n01- Irme Kero\n02- Mano Suave\n03- Adio Kerida\n04- Una Noche Mas\n05- Nani Nani\n06- Komo La Roza\n07- Si Veriash\n08- Mal De L'Amor\n09- Por La Mia\n10- Una Ora\n11- Perdono\n12- Odecha\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd56354e507ee980d6b2834ce5ceb49a12879bb","amp;dn":"Yasmin+Levy+-+Mano+Suave+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd56354e507ee980d6b2834ce5ceb49a12879bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,213,99,84,229,7,238,152,13,107,40,52,206,92,235,73,161,40,121,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
