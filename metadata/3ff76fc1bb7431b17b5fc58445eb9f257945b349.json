III. After the Earth's conditions become too hostile \nfor humans due to war, global warming and pollution, a fictional interstellar \nmegacorporation named Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) plans to colonize E.D.N. \nIII, a new Earth-like planet in grip of a brutal ice age. NEVEC discover that \nE.D.N. III is inhabited by an aggressive and territorial insectoid alien species \nnamed the Akrid, which come in all shapes and sizes and generate their own \nprecious thermal energy. 150 years after a great war was fought in which the \nhumans lost to the Akrid, the plot of the game revolves around Wayne Holden, a \nsoldier who attempts to overthrow NEVEC, who still vie for control over E.D.N. \nIII, and help colonization efforts for the remainder of the human race by \ndestroying the Akrid, all the while attempting to survive both betrayals and the \nextreme conditions of the planet.\n \n\nThe game is played through a third person over-the-shoulder view. Players are \nallowed to switch between first person and third person at any moment. Players \neither travel on foot or ride various types of mechanized suits called Vital \nSuits (VSs). VSs carry heavy weapons such as chainguns and rocket launchers. \nThey can pick up weapons lying on the ground and fire multiple weapons at once. \nOn foot, players are able to use a grappling hook to pull themselves up to \nnormally hard-to-reach places, or to hook onto a VS and hijack it. Driving VSs \nand using certain weapons requires thermal energy. Also, the planet's cold \ntemperature causes the characters' thermal energy level to continually decrease. \nPlayers can replenish their thermal energy level by defeating enemies or \nactivating data posts. Data posts also allow players to use their navigational \nradars to see incoming enemies. Each of the 11 levels is accompanied by a boss, \nwhich can be either a VS or a large Akrid.\n\nLost Planet: Extreme Condition\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nMinimum System Requirements (DirectX 9 Graphics)\nOS: Windows XP\nProcessor: Pentium 4 HT @ 3.5 GHz or Athlon Equivalent\nMemory: 512 MB\nHard Drive: 8 GB Free\nVideo Memory: 256 MB (GeForce 6600 or better) with Shader 3.0\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 9.0c\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nDVD Rom Drive\n\nRecommended System Requirements (DirectX 10 Graphics)\nOS: Windows Vista\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 DUO\nMemory: 1 GB (2 GB on Windows Vista)\nHard Drive: 8 GB Free\nVideo Memory: 256 MB (GeForce 8600)\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 10\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nDVD Rom Drive\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 :Extract Package with 7zip\n2 :Run setup.exe and install the game\n3 :Copy the file in the &quot;Crack&quot; folder to Program files/CAPCOM/Lost \nPlanet...(where it installed to)\n-Done-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff76fc1bb7431b17b5fc58445eb9f257945b349","amp;dn":"Lost+Planet-Extreme+Conditions-Colonies+Edition+%5Btim225%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ff76fc1bb7431b17b5fc58445eb9f257945b349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,247,111,193,187,116,49,177,123,95,197,132,69,235,159,37,121,69,179,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
