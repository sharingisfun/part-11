In the aftermath of the announcement, \r\nthe streets fill with protestors and riots erupt all throughout the country. \r\nYasmina is a poor girl who has never known a life outside of the ghetto, and she sees the riots as an \r\nopportunity to stage a series of smash-and-grab robberies that could provide her with the money needed \r\nto improve her lot in life. After rounding up a few pals and robbing a few businesses under the cover of the chaos, \r\nYasmina and her friends are pursued by the police and forced to split up. Before they part ways, however,\r\nthey all agree to regroup at an inn just outside of Luxembourg. The proprietors of the inn are the Von Geisler clan.\r\nLed by a tyrannical, jackbooted patriarch, the Von Geisler's are a curious lot who at first appear to be stuck in the past\r\nBut the Von Geisler's aren't just eccentric, they are devoted Neo-Nazis with a twisted fantasy of starting\r\na new master race and they have chosen Yasmina as their Aryan Eve. Now, in order for Yasmina\r\nas their Aryan Eve. Now, in order for Yasmina to escape a grim fate as a fascistic breeding machine, \r\nshe and her friends must fight for their lives against the brutish Von Geisler boys and their savage sisters \r\nin a vicious battle that will transform this once peaceful inn into a blood soaked abattoir.\r\n===========================================================\r\n                 Frontier(s) (2007) Info\r\n[_________________________________________________________] \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814685/\r\nIMDB Ratings: 6,3/10 from 19.181 users  Metascore: 44/100 \r\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\r\nDirector: Xavier Gens\r\nWriter: Xavier Gens  \r\nProduced by: Laurent Tolleron\r\nStarring: AurÃ©lien Wiik, Samuel Le Bihan, Estelle LefÃ©bure\r\nMusic by: Jean-Pierre Taieb\r\nRelease dates: 1 July 2007 (Agde Film Festival)\r\nLanguage: French, German\r\nRunning time: 108 minutes\r\n===========================================================\r\nSubtitles Info:\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]\r\nFrontier(s).(2007).English.srt\r\nFrontier(s).(2007).Russian.srt\r\nFrontier(s).(2007).Portuguese.srt\r\nPS: Custom Subtitles\r\n===========================================================\r\nSource Info:\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]\r\nSource : FrontiÃ¨re(s).(2007).1080p.50i.LUE.BluRay.AVC.DTSHD-MA.5.1 - TuGAZx (&quot;Thanks&quot;)\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps / 1080p50i Full HD\r\nBDinfo : 1080p50i Blu-Ray Hardbox - 99 Copies/OOP\r\nMPEG-4 AVC 22,4 GB Movie @29.200 kbps, French DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (25GB Blu-ray Disc)\r\nPlayback Time : 01h:48min:09sec  108 min.\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\nPS: This Movie was recorded with a Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL Camera, Panavision Primo Lenses \r\nSo dont make stupid comments about image quality because the image its very good like the original Blu-Ray\r\nwas the director choice to record and give a certain old and crispy texture to the movie to obtain he results he wants\r\nExample: \n===========================================================\r\nSCREENSHOTS:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------| \nhttp://i.imgur.com/LqaU0qP.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/sXe9qTC.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/qpeGaWI.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ooUkj0.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ju8Lc1B.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OlBeRNe.jpg\r\n===========================================================\r\nBasic File #Stream Information :\r\n----------------------------------------------------------]\r\nFile Name/_________________________: Frontier(s).(2007).1080p.BrRip.5.1.x264.DTS.[TuGAZx].mkv\r\nFile Format/_______________________: Matroska Format (MKV)\r\nFile Size On Disk/_________________: 3,468,650,545 Bytes (3.230 GB)\r\nCodec Type/________________________: Advanced Video Coding (H.264) (AVC1)\r\nFormat Profile/____________________: High   \r\nImage Size/________________________: 1920 x 824 (240 : 103)\r\nFrame Rate/________________________: 23.98 Frame/Sec\r\nTotal # of Frames/_________________: 155,592 Frames\r\nPlayback Time/_____________________: 01:48:09 (6489 Sec)\r\n===========================================================\r\nAudio  Stream #(1) Specifications:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------]\r\nFormat/____________________________: DTS (Digital Theater Systems)\r\nCodec Type/________________________: DTS audio \r\nBit rate mode/_____________________: Constant (CbR)\r\nBit rate/__________________________: 768 Kbps\r\nSampling Rate/_____________________: 48,000 Hz (48.0 Khz)\r\nChannel(s)/________________________: 6 Channels (5.1 Surround)\r\nBit depth/_________________________: 24 bits\r\nPlayback Time/_____________________: 01:48:09 (6489 Sec)\r\nLanguage/__________________________: French (fre)\r\n===========================================================\r\nAudio  Stream #(2) Specifications:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------]\r\nCodec Type/________________________: AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) \r\nFormat/____________________________: LC (VbR)\r\nSampling Rate/_____________________: 48,000 Hz (48.0 Khz)\r\nBit rate/__________________________: 96 Kbps - 140 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)/________________________: 2 Channels (STEREO)\r\nPlayback Time/_____________________: 01:48:09 (6489 Sec)\r\nLanguage/__________________________: French (fre)\r\n===========================================================\r\nGreetz to all our friends from the past to present!!
