Which,\n              come to think of it, also doesn't show any genitals. So I guess it\n              does illustrate the point after all, after a fashion! :P\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403cbda70391a3d401776f3167e4aff80525386a","amp;dn":"%5BHiFi%7CEros%5D+Kung+Fu+Sex+Fighters+1-2+%28Eurotica%7C2003%7CGN-HR%7CPudgy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403cbda70391a3d401776f3167e4aff80525386a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,60,189,167,3,145,163,212,1,119,111,49,103,228,175,248,5,37,56,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
