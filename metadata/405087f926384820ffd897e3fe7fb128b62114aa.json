YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get started by learning what additional hardware you need and how to connect it, install Debian Linux and configure it to your needs, and customize the PiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s firmware to get the most out of your hardware.\n\nThen the fun begins. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll connect the Pi to your home network and try surfing the web and tweeting messages. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to get the most out of Midori, the PiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard browser. Then in a few simple steps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll turn the Pi into a kiosk system that displays Twitter live search information. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how you can control the desktops of other PCs in your house with the Pi.\n\nOnce you have the basics down, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore the PiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s versatility with a series of home projects. Turn it into a web server in your home network. Convert the Pi into a powerful multimedia center so you can watch high-definition video and listen to your favorite music. Play classic video games. Then use the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to build electronics projects such as an Ã¢â‚¬Å“out of memoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ alarm, and learn how to access the project using a web browser.
