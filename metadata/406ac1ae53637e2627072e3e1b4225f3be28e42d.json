The text is organized ontogenically. It begins with the emergence of the neural primordium and takes a chapter-by-chapter approach in succeeding events in neural development: patterning and growth of the nervous system, neuronal determination, axonal navigation and targeting, neuron survival and death, synapse formation and developmental plasticity. Finally, in the last chapter, with the construction phase nearing completion, we examine the emergence of behavior. This new edition reflects the complete modernization of the field that has been achieved through the intensive application of molecular, genetic, and cell biological approaches. It is richly illustrated with color photographs and original drawings. Combined with the clear and concise writing, the illustrations make this a book that is well suited to students approaching this intriguing field for the first time. \r\nFeatures - Thorough survey of the field of neural development - Concise but complete, suitable for a one semester course on upper level undergraduate or graduate level - Focus on fundamental principles of organogenesis in the nervous system - Integrates information from a variety of model systems, relating them to human nervous system development, including disorders of development - Systematically develops knowledge from the description of key experiments and results. - Organized ontologically - Carefully edited to be presented in one voice - New edition thoroughly updated and revised to include major new findings - All figures in full color, updated and revised - Specific attention on revising the chapter on cognitive and behavioral development to provide a foundation and outlook towards those very fast moving areas - Instructor website with figure bank and test questions\r\n\r\nBenefits - The only thorough textbook of Developmental Neuroscience on the market - Carefully structured and edited to map onto the syllabus of most developmental neuroscience courses - Priced to be affordable for undergraduates even in addition to broader textbooks - Carefully constructed instructor's website - Specifically designed to make teaching of complicated subjects easy and fun for instructors and students alike&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406ac1ae53637e2627072e3e1b4225f3be28e42d","amp;dn":"Development+of+the+Nervous+System+-+3rd+Ed+%282011%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406ac1ae53637e2627072e3e1b4225f3be28e42d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,106,193,174,83,99,126,38,39,7,46,62,27,66,37,243,190,40,228,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
