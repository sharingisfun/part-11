Anderson\n\n\nIn Marx at the Margins, Kevin Anderson uncovers a variety of extensive but neglected texts by the well-known political economist which cast what we thought we knew about his work in a startlingly different light. Analyzing a variety of MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings, including journalistic work written for the New York Tribune, Anderson presents us with a Marx quite at odds with our conventional interpretations. Rather than providing us with an account of Marx as an exclusively class-based thinker, Anderson here offers a portrait of Marx for the twenty-first century: a global theorist whose social critique was sensitive to the varieties of human social and historical development, including not just class, but nationalism, race, and ethnicity, as well.\n\n Marx at the Margins ultimately argues that alongside his overarching critique of capital, Marx created a theory of history that was multi-layered and not easily reduced to a single model of development or revolution. Through highly-informed readings on work ranging from MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unpublished 1879Ã¢â‚¬â€œ82 notebooks to his passionate writings about the antislavery cause in the United States, this volume delivers a groundbreaking and canon-changing vision of Karl Marx that is sure to provoke lively debate in Marxist scholarship and beyond.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41524f113b31cb4b37313a9d9a56d9544dceb925","amp;dn":"Marx+at+the+Margins%3A+On+Nationalism%2C+Ethnicity%2C+and+Non-Western+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41524f113b31cb4b37313a9d9a56d9544dceb925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,82,79,17,59,49,203,75,55,49,58,157,154,86,217,84,77,206,185,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
