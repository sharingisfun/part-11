It includes new information on register, pronunciation, gender, number, foreign words (Latin, Arabic, English, Spanish, Italian), adjectives and past participles used as nouns, texting, word order, frequency of occurrence of words, and usage with all geographical names. Examples come not only from France, but also from Quebec, Belgium and Switzerland. Readers will appreciate the initial passages illustrating the grammatical features of a given chapter. Also included is a user-friendly introduction to the French language, from its Latin origins to modern times. A full glossary explains any terms that might confuse the less experienced reader, and the index leads the student through the detailed labyrinth of grammatical features. This handbook will be an invaluable resource for students and teachers who want to perfect their knowledge of all aspects of French grammar.\n\n\n# Paperback: 800 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; Bilingual edition (August 22, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521145112\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521145114","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:417f8ab5cc1dd21195545ef3143783f3a9d29fed","amp;dn":"A+Reference+Grammar+of+French+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"417f8ab5cc1dd21195545ef3143783f3a9d29fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,127,138,181,204,29,210,17,149,84,94,243,20,55,131,243,169,210,159,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
