Three worlds. Three times. Three young women, past, present, and future, come together to solve an age-old mystery and save a world.Meredith has the summer all planned. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hang out with her friends, ride her horse, and spend time with her mom, who is recovering from cancer. Then her mom drops a bomb: sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sending Meredith to Egypt to dig up mummies with her aunt the archaeologist. Meredith doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go. \n\nAt all. But there are more forces at work than a sixteenth-birthday present she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want and a summer she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t planÃ¢â‚¬â€and a greater adventure than she could ever have imagined.\n\nMeru lives in a far-future Earth, where disease has been eliminated and humans travel through the stars in living ships. Meru and her friend Yoshi have been accepted into the school for starpilots, but just as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to leave, a strange message from MeruÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother drives Meru away from her home and family and sends her on a journey to find her mother and save the people of Earth from a terrible plague.\n\nMeritre is a singer in the Temple of Amon in ancient Egypt. Her people have survived a devastating plague, but Meritre is foresighted, and what she sees is terrifying. As she tries to find a magical spell that will keep her family and friends safe, the gods take one last lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and that life, and death, resonate through Meredith and Meru to the end of time.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical/Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b2a71b221b632c230382225b6020700bb673fd","amp;dn":"Living+in+Threes+by+Judith+Tarr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b2a71b221b632c230382225b6020700bb673fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,178,167,27,34,27,99,44,35,3,130,34,91,96,32,112,11,182,115,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
