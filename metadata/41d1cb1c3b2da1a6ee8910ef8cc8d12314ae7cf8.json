While most research has been conducted in English, this text presents cross-language comparisons to provide insights into universal aspects of reading development and developmental dyslexia in alphabetic and non-alphabetic languages.\n\nThe book brings together contributions from a group of leading literacy researchers from around the world. It begins by examining the development of language skills in monolingual speakers of alphabetic and non-alphabetic languages; it then explores literacy acquisition in bilingual children learning to read in languages with different spelling-sound rules, including English, French, Greek, Welsh and Japanese. The second section is devoted to developmental dyslexia in monolingual and bilingual speakers of different languages and examines the impact of variations in orthography on the symptoms and aetiology of dyslexia. The final section explores the contribution of brain imaging to the study of impaired and unimpaired reading, giving an up-to-the-minute picture of how the brain deals with different languages and writing systems.\n\nThis is ideal reading for advanced undergraduates and postgraduates who have an interest in language acquisition, reading and spelling, as well as speech and language therapists, teachers and special educational needs professionals.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 336 pages\n# Publisher: Psychology Press; 1 edition (July 8, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1841697125\n# ISBN-13: 978-1841697123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41d1cb1c3b2da1a6ee8910ef8cc8d12314ae7cf8","amp;dn":"Reading+and+Dyslexia+in+Different+Orthographies+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41d1cb1c3b2da1a6ee8910ef8cc8d12314ae7cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,209,203,28,59,45,161,166,238,137,16,239,140,200,209,35,20,174,124,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
