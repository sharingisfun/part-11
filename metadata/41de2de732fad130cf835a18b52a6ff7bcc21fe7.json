In the course of the journey, their ship is destroyed and a handful (of the best-looking ones) are washed upon an island. There, they find their Viking Men, who are being kept prisoners in a large rock quarry by a primitive band of Viking-era Barbarian Warriors. With much resourcefulness, they rescue the men-folk and all set sail for Viking Land, pursued hotly by the Barbarian Warriors. But the pursuit party is destroyed by a Viking-era Sea Monster, who then turns its attentions upon the Viking Flotilla, but Vedrick the Viking tosses a sword at the Sea Monster, which instantly deflates it.

The old black and white box art showed all the Viking women including Abby Dalton.  I am old enough to remember her not from game shows but from a tv sitcom called Hennessey starring and directed by Jackie Cooper.  I never forgot it.  Time passes I was able to persude the local library to make the acquisition for their Cult Classics.\n\n  On the DVD double bill is also Teenage Caveman starring Robert Vaught before he became Napoleon Solo:  The Man From The United Network Command For Law Enforcement (UNCLE).\n\n  coming soon....\n\n\nNotes written September 19th, 2012\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41de2de732fad130cf835a18b52a6ff7bcc21fe7","amp;dn":"Saga+of+the+Viking+Women+and+Their+Voyage+to+the+Waters+of+the+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41de2de732fad130cf835a18b52a6ff7bcc21fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,222,45,231,50,250,209,48,207,131,90,24,181,42,111,247,188,194,31,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
