I have taken the Origial FLAC and WAV Vinyl Rip\nFiles Converted them to MP3 @320Kbps, Correctly Tagged the files and in the case of\nthe 12 inch Split each song where I thought appropriate so you can skip track and\nselect songs for Ipod sync and finaly provided the Cover Art.  In Some cases for this upload I've increased the Volume as you could barely hear the Tracks from the Original Rips but I've been conservative as I didn't want it to sound Processsed. \n\nENJOY!\n\nCONTENTS\n\nThe White Stripes - Party of Special Things to Do (7 Vinyl) Third Man Records {VAULT}\n\nThis item is a an exclusive VAULT release from Third Man Records.
