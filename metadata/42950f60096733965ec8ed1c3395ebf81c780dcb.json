This excellent compilation contains 22 of their earlier singles: from the bouncy &amp;quot;One Step Beyond&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Baggy Trousers&amp;quot;, the jerky &amp;quot;House of Fun&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;It Must Be Love&amp;quot;. These were all short, jaunty tunes with lyrics about real life--sometimes amusing, sometimes sombre in tone, but always grounded in the real world. This CD is an excellent introduction to a band that was very much a product of their time.\n\nFormat: mp3\nBitrate: 256k\nCovers: Front, back, CD\nTracker: prq.to.announce\n\n1. The Prince\n2.
