To his masters consternation, the cat immediately begins to tell lies (the first being that he didnt eat the parrot). The rabbi vows to educate him in the ways of the Torah, while the cat insists on studying the kabbalah and having a Bar Mitzvah. They consult the rabbis rabbi, who maintains that a cat cant be Jewish  but the cat, as always, knows better.\n\nZlabya falls in love with a dashing young rabbi from Paris, and soon master and cat, having overcome their shared self-pity and jealousy, are accompanying the newlyweds to France to meet Zlabyas cosmopolitan in-laws. Full of drama and adventure, their trip invites countless opportunities for the rabbi and his cat to grapple with all the important  and trivial  details of life.\n\nRich with the colors, textures, and flavors of Algerias Jewish community, The Rabbis Cat brings a lost world vibrantly to life  a time and place where Jews and Arabs coexisted  and peoples it with endearing and thoroughly human characters, and one truly unforgettable cat.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/7710/r000.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/7710/r000.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1747/r004b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1747/r004b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/3605/r025.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/3605/r025.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/5097/r128.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/5097/r128.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b54a464b6f9ac5502b4dcb386a0bd87ba4dde3","amp;dn":"The+Rabbi%27s+Cat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b54a464b6f9ac5502b4dcb386a0bd87ba4dde3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,181,74,70,75,111,154,197,80,43,77,203,56,106,11,216,123,164,221,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
