Unlike the first documentary, Part II showcases interviews with board-certified oncologists, surgeons and neurosurgeons, who witnessed patients leave their care, soon to return in great health after opting for the Burzynski Clinic.\n\nSince the mapping of the Cancer Genome, Burzynski has pioneered an expansion of his therapy which he calls, &quot;Personalized Gene-Targeted Cancer Therapy&quot;, where each patient's Genomic Cancer Atlas is mapped and a treatment regimen is personally tailored for each individual patientÃ¢â‚¬â€vs. the conveyor belt, &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach that current oncology adheres to. \n\nDue to the slow-moving, bureaucratic obstacles enforced on Antineoplastons by America's FDA, this new expanded &quot;personalized gene-targeted&quot; direction has allowed more patients (who are denied access to Antineoplastons) to benefit from Burzynski's practice in ways never before thought possible. And yet, still with similar resistance and controversy endured by Burzynski's Antineoplaston therapy.\n\nThe film also takes you to Kurume University in Fukuoka, JapanÃ¢â‚¬â€where independently designed studies of Antineoplastons have been underway for 27 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€without Dr. Burzynski's (the inventor's) involvement or supervision. Learn how this team of Japanese pathologists, oncologists and surgeons have studied these anti-cancer compounds using their own methodologiesÃ¢â‚¬â€resulting in the first ever independently-run randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\n&quot;After twenty-seven years of independently testing AntineoplastonsÃ¢â‚¬â€including randomized clinical trials, we found that Dr. Burzynski was right. It's obviously not anecdotal anymore.&quot;\n- Hideaki Tsuda, MD - 2013, Kurume Medical University, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan\n\nYou will be placed into the turbulent journey of how the industry utilizes its now usurped regulatory agency to both block Antineoplastons' Phase 3 clinical trial processÃ¢â‚¬â€and orchestrate a group of &quot;information hit men&quot; (also known as an &quot;Astroturf Campaign&quot;) to pollute all channels of public information in an effort to confuse the public over the truth behind Antineoplastons. This international Astroturf group also engages in the intimidation and harassment of prospective and current terminal cancer patients under Dr. Burzynski's care. \n\nHowever, most notable of allÃ¢â‚¬â€are the earth-shattering events that occurred upon the final days of production of this filmÃ¢â‚¬â€you'll be left speechless, yet with so much to say, when you witness the story and shocking conclusion to Burzynski: Cancer Is Serious Business, Part II.\n\n&quot;I can't imagine a world where other people will not have the privilege that I have hadÃ¢â‚¬â€the privilege to have their life saved by a new technology that can cure cancerÃ¢â‚¬â€it's terrifying.&quot;\n\n- Laura Hymas - 2013, Glioblastoma Grade IV brain cancer patient, after experiencing a complete remission under Antineoplaston therapy.\n\n- See more at: http://www.burzynskimovie.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c01b3dbf4eabe376b98179b506674e8559a74c","amp;dn":"Burzynski+Cancer+is+Serious+Business+Part+2+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c01b3dbf4eabe376b98179b506674e8559a74c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,192,27,61,191,78,171,227,118,185,129,121,181,6,103,78,133,89,167,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
