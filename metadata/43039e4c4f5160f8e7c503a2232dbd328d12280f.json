Once called Father Frank for his efforts to rescue lives, Frank sees the ghosts of those he failed to save around every turn. He has tried everything he can to get fired, calling in sick, delaying taking calls where he might have to face one more victim he couldn&amp;#039;t help, yet cannot quit the job on his own.\n\n\nStarring:\n\nNicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43039e4c4f5160f8e7c503a2232dbd328d12280f","amp;dn":"Bringing.Out.The.Dead%7BAC3-5.1%7DDvdRip.Dino.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43039e4c4f5160f8e7c503a2232dbd328d12280f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,3,158,76,79,81,96,248,231,197,3,162,35,45,189,50,141,18,40,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
