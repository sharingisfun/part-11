Knopf, 1988).\n\nISBN: 9780679724315 | 608 pages | EPUB\n\n\nSTORIES IN AN ALMOST CLASSICAL MODE is a short story collection by the American writer Harold Brodkey (1930 - 1996).  Most of the stories were published in The New Yorker between 1963 and 1988, representing the best of Brodkey's work over those decades.\n\nStories included:\n * &quot;The Abundant Dreamer&quot;\n * &quot;On the Waves&quot;\n * &quot;Bookkeeping&quot;\n * &quot;Hofstedt and Jean--and Others&quot;\n * &quot;The Shooting Range&quot;\n * &quot;Innocence&quot;\n * &quot;Play&quot;\n * &quot;A Story in an Almost Classical Mode&quot;\n * &quot;His Son, in His Arms, in Light, Aloft&quot;\n * &quot;Puberty&quot;\n * &quot;The Pain Continuum&quot;\n * &quot;Largely an Oral History of My Mother&quot;\n * &quot;Verona: A Young Woman Speaks&quot;\n * &quot;Ceil&quot;\n * &quot;S.L.&quot;\n * &quot;The Nurse's Music&quot;\n * &quot;The Boys on Their Bikes&quot;\n * &quot;Angel&quot;\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;These 18 stories are freighted with a magnificence of language that reveals Brodkey&quot;s singular ability to convey the truth and complexity of a moment in time, frequently as seen through the eyes of a child.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;The stories are 'classical' only in the sense that they avoid trendy experimentation: there isn't a trace of minimalism, metaficiton, or magic realism.  Brodkey's subject is the Sturm und Drang of human relationships, especially sexual relationships.  Acutely sensitive, intensely analytical, he writes with 'the authority of being on one's knees in front of the event' (to quote one of his characters).  No matter what the situation, the narrative voice is invariably eloquent and intelligent.&quot; -- Library Journal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4313116b9f0c20b2dc8b92ea493624f68aacf67d","amp;dn":"Harold+Brodkey+-+Stories+in++an+Almost+Classical+Mode+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4313116b9f0c20b2dc8b92ea493624f68aacf67d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,19,17,107,159,12,32,178,220,139,146,234,73,54,36,246,138,172,246,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
