This new chapter in the Call of Duty\n  franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled\n  nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive.  \n    \n  Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen\n  engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while\n  maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all\n  platforms.  \n    \n  Single Player Campaign  \n    \n  - Ten years after a devastating mass event, Americas borders and the balance\n    of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's\n    Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as &quot;Ghosts&quot; leads\n    the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global\n    power.  \n    \n  - A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history,\n    players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts;\n    outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation\n    in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely\n    new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike\n    anything seen in Call of Duty before.\n\n\n  1. Unrar.\n  2.
