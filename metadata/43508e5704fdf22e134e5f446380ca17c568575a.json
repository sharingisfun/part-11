Some of them are commercial releases, some of them are amateur game rips.  None of them I did myself.  The bit rates and the encoding quality varies from soundtrack to soundtrack.  The list is by no means exhaustive, but I had a hard time finding some of these soundtracks so I am offering them here to make it easier for everybody else.  \n\nThese are the games:  Faxanadu (NES), Crystalis (NES), Secret of Evermore (SNES), Legend of Legaia (PS1), Alundra (PS1), Ultima Underworld (PS1), Star Ocean - The Second Story (PS1), Thousand Arms (PS1), Lunar Silver Star Story Complete (PS1), Threads of Fate (PS1), Lunar 2 Eternal Blue (PS1), Valkyrie Profile (PS1), Vandal Hearts (PS1); Chrono Trigger (SNES), Radical Dreamers (SV), Chrono Cross (PS1); Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 (SNES), Dragon Quest 3 (SNES), Dragon Quest 4 (NES), Dragon Quest 5 (SNES), Dragon Quest 6 (SNES), Dragon Quest 7 (PS1), Dragon Quest 8 (PS2); Seiken Densetsu (Gameboy), Secret of Mana (SNES), Seiken Densetsu 3 (SNES), Legend of Mana (PS1), Sword of Mana (GBA); plus a few remake soundtracks and covers.  I deliberately left out Final Fantasy, because those are pretty easy to find, and anyway I was always more into Dragon Warrior *pbbbbbt*!  (I reaaaally hate anime cut-scenes!)  :)\n\nHere are some of the sites where I found them, and where you may be able to find more soundtracks like them (such as the original NES versions of Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior, or Final Fantasy, or Zelda):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sound-test.org/soundtracks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sound-test.org/soundtracks/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://snesorama.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://snesorama.us/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bluelaguna.net/music/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bluelaguna.net/music/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--FluxCapacitor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43508e5704fdf22e134e5f446380ca17c568575a","amp;dn":"Intro+to+Console+RPG+OST+Soundtracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43508e5704fdf22e134e5f446380ca17c568575a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,80,142,87,4,253,242,46,19,78,95,68,99,128,202,23,197,104,87,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
