A Burnable Book [John Gower, #1] - Bruce Holsinger\n\n\n\nIn Chaucer's London, betrayal, murder, royal intrigue, mystery, and dangerous politics swirl around the existence of a prophetic book that foretells the deaths of England's kings. Bruce Holsinger's A Burnable Book is an irresistible historical thriller reminiscent of the classics An Instance of the Fingerpost, The Name of the Rose, and The Crimson Petal and the White.\n\nLondon, 1385. Surrounded by ruthless courtiersÃ¢â‚¬â€including his powerful uncle, John of Gaunt, and Gaunt's artful mistress, Katherine SwynfordÃ¢â‚¬â€England's young, still untested king, Richard II, is in mortal peril, and the danger is only beginning. Songs are heard across LondonÃ¢â‚¬â€catchy verses said to originate from an ancient book that prophesies the end of England's kingsÃ¢â‚¬â€and among the book's predictions is Richard's assassination.\n\nOnly a few powerful men know that the cryptic lines derive from a &quot;burnable book,&quot; a seditious work that threatens the stability of the realm. To find the manuscript, wily bureaucrat Geoffrey Chaucer turns to fellow poet John Gower, a professional trader in information with connections high and low. Gower discovers that the book and incriminating evidence about its author have fallen into the unwitting hands of innocents, who will be drawn into a labyrinthine conspiracy that reaches from the king's court to London's slums and stewsÃ¢â‚¬â€and potentially implicates his own son. As the intrigue deepens, it becomes clear that Gower, a man with secrets of his own, may be the last hope to save a king from a terrible fate.\n\nMedieval scholar Bruce Holsinger draws on his vast knowledge of the period to add colorful, authentic detailÃ¢â‚¬â€on everything from poetry and bookbinding to court intrigues and brothelsÃ¢â‚¬â€to this highly entertaining and brilliantly constructed epic literary mystery that brings medieval England gloriously to life.\n\n02. The Invention of Fire [John Gower, #2] - Bruce Holsinger\n\n\n\nThe author of the acclaimed medieval mystery A Burnable Book once again brings fourteenth-century London alive in all its color and detail in this riveting thriller featuring medieval poet and fixer John Gower--a twisty tale rife with intrigue, danger, mystery, and murder\n\nLondon, 1386. A mass murder has taken place within the city walls. Sixteen corpses have been dumped where they are sure to be found, bearing wounds like none seen before.\n\nJohn Gower, middling poet and expert trader in secrets, is summoned to investigate the killings even as the ruthless mayor of London seeks to thwart an open inquiry for reasons unknown. Gower learns that the men have fallen victim to handgonnes, new and terrifying weapons that threaten to change the future of war.\n\nChallenged by deception and treachery on all sides, Gower struggles against his failing vision even as his inquiries take him from the city's labyrinthine slums to the port of Calais to the forests of Kent, where his friend Geoffrey Chaucer serves as justice of the peace. As Gower strives to discover the source of the new guns and the identity of those who wielded them, he must risk everything to reveal the truth--and prevent a more devastating massacre on London's crowded streets","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:437e3cd2bdb9a50997a165010d412766e5043c72","amp;dn":"John+Gower+Series+-+Bruce+Holsinger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"437e3cd2bdb9a50997a165010d412766e5043c72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,126,60,210,189,185,165,9,151,161,101,1,13,65,39,102,229,4,60,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
