In addition, Daryl and Todd perform Rundgren originals &quot;Sweet,&quot; &quot;Want of a Nail,&quot; &quot;Sometimes I Don't Know What to Feel&quot; and &quot;Can We Still be Friends&quot; and must-see versions of the Soul Survivors' hit, &quot;Expressway to Your Heart&quot; and Average White Band's &quot;You Got It.&quot;\n\n&quot;It was great working with Daryl again, bookending the 37 years since my producing War Babies,&quot; says Rundgren of the Live from Daryl's House experience.\n\nRundgren also produced the recent New York Dolls album, Cause I Sez So, on Rhino/Atco, 37 years after he did the honors on the mythic band's debut. Four of his current first-ever A Wizard, A True Star&quot; performances were streamed on the web, with one being shot for a live DVD/CD. In addition, Rundgren just attended the opening of a Celebrity Spotlight Exhibit featuring highlights of his career in Cleveland on Sept. 7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4385bed5631c37ef03dfc95d7dd637a417c0a315","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%5C%27s.House.e23.Todd.Rundgren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4385bed5631c37ef03dfc95d7dd637a417c0a315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,133,190,213,99,28,55,239,3,223,201,93,125,214,55,164,23,192,163,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
