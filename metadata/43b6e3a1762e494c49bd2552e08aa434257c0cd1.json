Among their posthumous efforts, Movie Music, Vol. 1 and its sequentially titled companion piece are perhaps the most collectable of these postmortem offerings. This first volume is a complete collection of songs from the groups many 7 inch singles. Braid was notorious for keeping much of their best material off of the full-length releases, so this collection is of no small interest. Like volume two, Movie Music, Vol. 1 is chronologically sequenced, thus allowing listeners an opportunity to chart the bands growth. Established fan favorites like Im Afraid of Everything and Now I'm Exhausted are not only release highlights, but also career standouts. With 17 tracks of relatively consistent songwriting and performing, Movie Music, Vol. 1 is highly recommended for both new listeners and collectors looking to avoid purchasing the many singles necessary to duplicate this track list. This is one of Braids strongest full-length discs.\n\nReleased: 2000\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Alternative\nQuality: 320kbps\nCodec: mp3\n\nTracks:\n\nVol 1.\n\n 1. Sounds Like Violence\n 2.
