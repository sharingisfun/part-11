After a lengthy career in industry, working on remote sensing and non-destructive testing, Dr. Cunningham returned to academic pursuits that centered on structural biology. He taught at The University of Texas-Pan American for nine years, including numerous sections of University Physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f6572ce7bd4c84dcc4cf1b91915ca2eeec3410","amp;dn":"Neoclassical+Physics%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f6572ce7bd4c84dcc4cf1b91915ca2eeec3410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,246,87,44,231,189,76,132,220,196,207,27,145,145,92,162,238,236,52,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
