Fancey production is quite remarkable. Firstly, it is not a film typical of E.J. FanceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output and in many peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinion, it is by far their best production. Although there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t many location shots, with a good script and a very fine cast, the film works.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a post wartime story of French resistance and a traitor; Anton Diffring is excellent as a concert pianist rather than his usual nasty Nazi and Christopher Lee is very good without his cape and fangs! Mr Wolfit gives a typical Wolfit turn but most interesting is perhaps the director Michael McCarthy, who also wrote the screenplay and passed away in 1959 at the tender age of 42 and seemed well set to go on to bigger and better things. Picture and sound are excellent following restoration.\n\nEvery once in a while, something gets pried out from within cracks of time. In the instance of The Traitor - a 1957 mystery from the UK that was released in the US under the more ambiguous title, The Accursed in 1958 - we have at long last been given the opportunity to see one of the few feature films made by the seemingly-promising talent of a young would-be auteur by the name of Michael McCarthy.\n \nIt's a kind of old dark house mystery. A group of men who were in the World War 2 underground meet at Wolfit's invitation. His goal is to ferret out the man who betrayed their leader.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 403mb\nDuration.... 01:21:45\nCodec.......
