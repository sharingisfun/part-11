April Wine found success with their second studio album On Record, which spawned two huge hit singles in Canada, &quot;You Could Have Been a Lady&quot;, a cover of the Hot Chocolate song, and &quot;Bad Side of the Moon&quot;, originally an Elton John song. They secured their fame and fan-base with their third release Electric Jewels and its many hit songs including, &quot;Just Like That&quot;, &quot;Lady Run, Lady Hide&quot; and &quot;Weeping Widow&quot;. The bulk of the band's success came in the 70s and early 80s, and during that time they released 12 studio albums and had numerous hit singles in Canada and toured extensively, primarily throughout Canada. The band broke-up in 1986 but reformed in 1992 and went on to release four more studio albums. Currently they continue to tour throughout Canada and the US.\n\n\n1.  All Over Town\n2.
