Together with Habib Koite, another Malian pioneer, this album is about as tight as I've ever heard. The recording is sharp, the solos and vocals hold nothing back, and it can be played for all occasions. The overall tone of the album is subdued and patient. It bounces you along slowly into a soundscape entirely Traore's. Every instrument is masterfully played, but again, I've gotta stress the vocals. Koite and Traore have incredible voices, friendly yet impassioned and colorful. This album is also an entirely different style than Ali Farka Toure - don't rank either artist over the other - it's basically futile to compare them except to say that Traore's work has a bit more of a beat. Both Toure and Traore have worked at Radio Mali and both artists are accepted as blues Masters in their home country. Macire has become my soundtrack for the world.\n\n*****\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44dbe4218fa7e2f4e3f89a72393c9cc63c211d3c","amp;dn":"Boubacar+Traore+Macire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44dbe4218fa7e2f4e3f89a72393c9cc63c211d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,219,228,33,143,167,226,244,227,248,154,114,57,60,156,198,60,33,29,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
