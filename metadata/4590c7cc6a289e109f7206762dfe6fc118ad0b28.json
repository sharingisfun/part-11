Drawing heavily on the paradigm of evolutionary psychology first articulated by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, Pinker covers subjects as diverse as vision, emotion, feminism, and, in the final chapter, &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; He also advocates the computational theory of mind. He criticizes difference feminism in his book because he believes scientific research has shown that women and men differ little or not at all in their moral reasoning. This book was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist.................\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4590c7cc6a289e109f7206762dfe6fc118ad0b28","amp;dn":"How+the+Mind+Works-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4590c7cc6a289e109f7206762dfe6fc118ad0b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,144,199,204,106,40,158,16,159,114,6,118,45,254,111,193,24,173,11,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
