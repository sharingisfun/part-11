Some returned from the hell of war to become major tourist attractions for new generations. Others continue to patrol the world's trouble-spots in America's latest war.\nHistory Classics: Hero Ships profiles the complete combat history and evolving technology of a single American ship, often through multiple conflicts. These are the battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, submarines, and specialized ships that belong in the warship hall of fame. Archival footage and interviews are punctuated by all-access inspections of the ship's &quot;battle stations,&quot; conducted by young, active Navy sailors. The series lets us understand the role of each weapon and technology, the dramas that unfolded in different rooms during the heat of battle, and the unique traditions and stories of each vessel.\nDVD Release Date: November 15, 2011\n\n\n10)  USS New Jersey \nNew Jersey's sponsor was Mrs. Charles Edison, wife of the Governor of New Jersey and daughter-in-law of the famous inventor Thomas Edison. After commissioning on May 23, 1943, the ship went through shakedown training and then proceeded to the Pacific, where she was involved in a long list of operations throughout the remainder of World War II. A particular highlight was service as flagship for Commander Third Fleet, Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.\n\n11)  USS New York \nA unique blend of present and past; USS New York's predecessor, the battleship New York, was born in 1911 and was present to take the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flo in 1918. At the end of the war she is slated a target ship for the great Bikini atom-bomb tests, but she shrugs off the damage that sent more modern ships to the bottom and is towed to Pearl Harbour. There she is studied for two years before finally being sunk in an epic eight hours of intense fire before slipping under. Returning once again to our latest New York, we watch the rebirth of a legend, filled with the dynamic shooting of the modern construction, crew and Navy.\n\n12)  USS Texas \nConsidered the most powerful warship afloat because of her ten 14&quot;/45 guns in five twin turrets, The USS Texas was commissioned in March of 1914 and proceeded almost immediately to Mexican waters where she joined the Special Service Squadron following the &quot;Vera Cruz Incident.&quot; She returned to Atlantic Fleet operations in the fall of 1914, after the Mexican crisis was resolved. In 1916 Texas became the first U.S. battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns and the first to control gunfire with directors and range-keepers, forerunners of today's computers. After the U.S. entered World War I, she spent 1917 training gun crews for merchant ships that were often attacked by gunfire from surfaced submarines. Texas joined the 6th Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet early in 1918, operating out of Scapa Flow and the Firth of Forth. Later in 1918 she guarded the German Fleet en route to its surrender anchorage and escorted President Wilson to peace talks in France.\n\n13)  USS Yorktown \nYorktown received 11 battle stars for her World War II service and was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. She was also the star of an Academy Award winning documentary movie &quot;Fighting Lady&quot; in 1945. Though no formal credit was given her in the film, the majority of the footage used in the film was shot on her decks by Navy combat photographers. Yorktown and other Essex class carriers comprised the core of the U.S. post-war fleet. After her Korean War duty, Yorktown was modernized for anti-submarine warfare and was deployed to Vietnam. For her service off Vietnam she was awarded four battle stars. In 1968 the carrier recovered the crew of Apollo 8, the first manned flight to orbit the moon. Decommissioned in 1970, Yorktown became the centrepiece of the fleet of ships at Patriots Point in 1975.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1953/9l7k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1953/9l7k.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/1448/39ob.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/1448/39ob.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/9976/ldei.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/9976/ldei.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/135/ku04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/135/ku04.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9941/1ft5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9941/1ft5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/3715/6j9p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/3715/6j9p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;622a0b050a222e514c52&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2136 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 687 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1236227/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1236227/episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a182d5aa3f118439b1b7e3da32bd81fe3bd49e","amp;dn":"History+Classics+Hero+Ships+10of13+USS+New+Jersey+DVDRip+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a182d5aa3f118439b1b7e3da32bd81fe3bd49e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,161,130,213,170,63,17,132,57,177,183,227,218,50,189,129,254,59,212,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
