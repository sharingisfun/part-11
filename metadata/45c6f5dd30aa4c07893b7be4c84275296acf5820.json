Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York\nduring early-to-mid 1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases.\n\nThis boxed set contains two previously-unreleased tracks and a new mix. &quot;Travelling\nRiverside Blues&quot; was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. &quot;White\nSummer&quot; was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The &quot;Moby\nDick&quot;/&quot;Bonzo's Montreux&quot; mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May\n1990.\n\nTo differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording\nindustry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection (not to be\nconfused with the later 1993 release The Complete Studio Recordings).\n\n\n&quot;In an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set&quot;\n\nOh, I'm now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My\nawareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set\nin 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians\nwho are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because\nthat's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly\nrecords. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone\ncarries the flame on..\n\n[Disc 1]\n\n  01. [05:33] - Whole Lotta Love\n  02. [04:12] - Heartbreaker\n  03.
