The Texas native Vaughan managed to take his influences such as brother Jimmie, rocker Jimi Hendrix, bluesman Albert King and jazzman Kenny Burrell and weave them into something unique and exciting. Vaughan burst upon the scene with his combination of ferocity, feeling and touch. Whether playing a cover of &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; a funky take on Stevie Wonder's &quot;Superstition&quot;, or the tortured blues of Elmore Jame's\n&quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;, he was always able to make the song his own. His singing could be both tender and heartfelt as in &quot;The Things (That) I Used To Do or raucous as in &quot;The House Is Rockin'&quot;. Sometimes he could be funky as in &quot;Say What&quot; or more jazzy as in &quot;Lenny&quot;. The influence of the jazz/blues organ trios like Jimmy Smith and Jack McDuff led Vaughan to add organist/keyboardist Reese Wynans to his band Double Trouble. Almost all of his essential cuts are included and the set contains more songs than &quot;Greatest Hits Vols 1 &amp; 2&quot;. I am especially glad overlooked cuts like Hound Dog Taylor's &quot;Give Me Back My Wig&quot;, Buddy Guy's\n&quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot; and &quot;Willie The Wimp&quot; were included. I have a couple of minor quibbles with the song selections. &quot;Ain't Gonna Give Up On Love&quot; is frustratingly absent as well as the slide guitar spotlight &quot;Boot Hill&quot;, a kinetic cover of Lonnie Mack's instrumental &quot;Wham&quot; and an inspired cover of Howlin' Wolf's &quot;I'm Leaving (Commit A Crime)&quot;. Everyone has their own personal favorites. It is a testiment to Vaughan's will that he was able to overcome his drug addiction and still make vital music. Like Hendrix and many of his blues and jazz idols he died before his time. However, you can still discover his legacy with this\n&quot;Essential&quot; 2 cd set.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Shake for me (live)                                  [03:51]\n02.Rude mood,hide away (live)                           [04:59]\n03.Love struck baby                                     [02:23]\n04.Pride and joy                                        [03:40]\n05.Texas flood                                          [05:21]\n06.Mary had a little lamb                               [02:47]\n07.Lenny                                                [04:57]\n08.Scuttle buttin'                                      [01:52]\n09.Couldn't stand the weather                           [04:42]\n10.The things (that) I used to do                       [04:55]\n11.Cold shot                                            [04:01]\n12.Tin pan alley (aka roughest place in town)           [09:12]\n13.Give me back my wig                                  [04:08]\n14.Empty arms                                           [03:29]\n15.The sky is crying (live)                             [07:20]\n16.Voodoo child (slight return) (live)                  [11:53]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.Say what!
