They make quite a few mistakes throughout\nthe set ('Sanctuary'!). Nonetheless, it's a great, energetic show from Maiden in what I consider their best period.\nThe video is a PAL recording, taken from what I guess is a 2nd generation video tape. Picture quality is pretty good,\nalthough there is some colour bleeding. I think I'd give the picture a VG to VG+ rating. Audio quality\nis great, but in mono. Furthermore, the Maiden concert was aired on Beatclub in two parts, on 2 different dates. For some reason,\nthey decided to show 'Santuary' on both dates... Rather than butcher the videotape to edit one 'Sactuary' out I decided to leave\nboth shows intact.  \n\nThe video tape was transferred to DVD using a stand alone DVD recorder. There's no fancy menu\nand just automatic tracks every 5 minutes. But at least the audio is in sync!\nPlease feel free to re-author the DVD, though. I just don't have the time or the knowledge.\n\nAll in all, this is a highly recommended piece of Maiden history, and one of the few\nproshots of Maiden w. Paul DiAnno.\n \nI can't upload screenshots, but I'm sure you'll like this.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSource:\nvideo cassette (2nd gen.?) -&gt; DVD -&gt; DVD Smartripper\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Prowler\n2.
