After saving it from a pack of leopard seals and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into Private.\r\n\r\nTen years later (after the events of the previous film), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into Fort Knox in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called &quot;Cheezy Dibbles&quot; in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is described as being the &quot;secretary/mascot&quot;. Suddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to Venice, Italy by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who removes his human disguise and reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their nature of cuteness had shunned him out of every major zoo in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 5603 Mb\r\nRuntiime: 88 min.\r\nLanguages: English, English Audio descriptive, German, Italian Ac3 5.1\r\nSubtitles: English for the Deaf and Hard of hearing, German,  Italian, Hindi\r\nExtra: Top Secret Guide to becoming and Elite agent, Madagascar Mash up, Cheezy dibbles Ad, Gallery, Theatrical Trailer, The World of DreamWorks animation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1911658/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4697474f7b8a855e98ca576fab98a6c456b2f248","amp;dn":"Penguins+of+Madagascar+-+I+Pinguini+di+Madagascar+%282014%29+%5BDVD9+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4697474f7b8a855e98ca576fab98a6c456b2f248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,151,71,79,123,138,133,94,152,202,87,111,171,152,166,196,86,178,242,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
