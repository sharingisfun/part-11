Truthfully, that was probably the best, and easily most necessary review of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven SistersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ required. I think that statement is perfect for the simple rationale that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precise and true. Sometimes simple is best. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven SistersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a superb album. It bears a quality all its own, derived from earnest singing and songwriting built upon gentle acoustic guitar, banjo playing and a smattering of other instruments that add to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s folksy, gypsy singer-songwriter feel.\n\nIf music is comfort food then Beta RadioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut is what the philosophy means to extol. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven SistersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ envelops you, embracing by way of a country-folk, and occasionally, a church feel. Its wandering-through-the-country texture lends the songs to small town environs and family life, of love and heartache. There are songs that linger via their pleasant rhythms and MabryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engaging vocals. His voice is friendly, deftly mirroring peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotions. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Darden RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mabry sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to clean my room/Cause I might clean my memories of youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and sounds wholly genuine. He makes those sentiments real, not just as gestations or contrivances of them.\n\nMabry has a singular voice. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t merely sing well, his voice is distinctive. As a singer he traverses between cool and calm to temperate and soaring, like Bono trying to be Paul Simon. On the somber Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Place for MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he begins with a subtle growl and when reaching the chorus stretches out in a pained timbre. The horns at the end make the song gravitate. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“KhimaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ MabryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals is a breeze crossing a front porch as Holloman steadily plays the banjo. It recalls the distant and lost quality of U2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mothers of the Disappeared.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mabry sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was wrong, I was wrongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the song sounds like territory Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amazing GraceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ once charted.\n\nMabry and guitarist Brent Holloman know how to write good songs, not just catchy and memorable ones. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where Losers DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Either WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are such obvious choices for radio singles and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt their music is overtly picturesque. Sincerity and soulfulness will carry them a long way, mirroring the presence of performers like Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Natalie Merchant or James Taylor. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven SistersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ illustrate Mabry and Holloman as a great recipe, a combination of singer and musician that will likely produce more outstanding music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46da33724056c4b8977678e2821aeec9eabdd7a6","amp;dn":"Beta+Radio+-+Seven+Sisters+%5B2010%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46da33724056c4b8977678e2821aeec9eabdd7a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,218,51,114,64,86,196,184,151,118,120,226,130,26,238,201,234,189,215,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
