But when the\r\n  interstellar mission to colonize the new world goes terribly awry, the fate\r\n  of their people falls into the hands of a lone adventurer. Now it's up to\r\n  you to unravel the mystery of what happened. Can you save them and their\r\n  mission, or is it already too late? \r\n\r\n\r\n  Prominence is a first-person, point-and-click adventure game for the PC\r\n  filled with puzzle-solving goodness, compelling character arcs, and an\r\n  engaging story of hope and humanity in the best traditions of good\r\n  science-fiction. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Key Features \r\n  *  Solve a dynamic mix of challenging, yet logical, puzzles that tie\r\n    directly into the story. \r\n  *  Discover clues and reconstruct the events of the mission through\r\n    emails, audio recordings, environmental clues, and a damaged central\r\n    computer in need of repairs. \r\n  *  Hack computer subsystems via a text-based interface. \r\n  *  Acquire and use additional skills and abilities as you progress\r\n    through the adventure. \r\n  *  Become immersed in the world through fully rendered HD environments\r\n    with animated movement and effects. \r\n  *  Access holographic data archives to explore a wealth of backstory,\r\n    environmental details, mission information, crewmember records, and more. \r\n  *  Experience an original soundtrack with over 40 minutes of music. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Previews&quot;...if the early preview demo of Prominence is anything to go by,\r\n  this latest space mystery will be one that is definitely worth\r\n  unravelling.&quot; \r\n  - AdventureGamers.com \r\n\r\n\r\n  &quot;...a very promising game.&quot; \r\n  - Gameboomers.com \r\n\r\n\r\n  &quot;Prominence is an excellent example of what a small but dedicated developer\r\n  can produce, and I thoroughly look forward to its final release, and so\r\n  should you.&quot; \r\n  - GamingLives.com \r\n\r\n\r\n  &quot;..evolves methodically and soon draws you deep into the mystery behind the\r\n  ill-fated mission.&quot; \r\n  - AdventureClassicGaming.com \r\n\r\n\r\n  &quot;Nicht nur Fans von SciFi-Werken wie Arthur C.
