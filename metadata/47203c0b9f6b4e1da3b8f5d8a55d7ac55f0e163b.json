Not only is it a near perfect visualization of something quite complex, the Faulkner literary style, but it shows Robert Duvall to be the genius that he is. His style is so understated that you might not realize that he is one of the two or three greatest actors alive, but this film will nail that reality home for you. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is a heartbreaking story set in the deep south a generation after the Civil War, and the tiny sad tale of a man and a woman and their child. It is a tale of profound love felt by people who cannot eloquently express themselves in words due to their social circumstances, but speak volumes with their actions. And so does the film. Shot in a very modernist style, there are long pauses, long glances, uncomfortable silences, all just like real life. And the effect, in this case, is brilliant. I am proud to say that I have, in my life, known a few people like the people in this film, and I can tell you that the portrayals are precisely right. The costumes are flawless in their detail.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47203c0b9f6b4e1da3b8f5d8a55d7ac55f0e163b","amp;dn":"Tomorrow+%281972%29+DvdRip+Eng+NKM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47203c0b9f6b4e1da3b8f5d8a55d7ac55f0e163b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,32,60,11,159,107,78,29,163,184,245,216,165,93,122,197,95,14,22,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
