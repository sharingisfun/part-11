One of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first electronic New Wave bands, they are widely cited (along with The Screamers from L.A.) as pioneers of a genre now known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;synthpunk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; The Units were notable for their use of synthesizers in place of guitars, and multimedia performances featuring multiple projections of satirical, instructional films critical of conformity and consumerism. \n\nTrack listing / Playtime\n01.
