The title is from a Cole Porter song, and the album reflects a transition to a more sophisticated level of songwriting.\n\nNight and Day paid tribute to the wit and style of Cole Porter (and indirectly to New York). Night and Day was Jackson's only studio album to reach the Top 5 in both the UK and U.S. Night and Day sold over one million copies, earning gold disc status. The tracks &quot;Real Men&quot; and &quot;A Slow Song&quot; pointed obliquely to the city's early 1980s gay culture. A&amp;M put considerable promotional muscle behind the album, and the resultant single &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; became a multi-format hit, eventually earning Grammy nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. The album also spawned a second Top 20 U.S. hit single in &quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot;. Jackson finished his Night and Day touring in May 1983.\n\nWhile &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; was a Top 10 in both the UK and the U.S. (UK #6, U.S. #6); &quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot; was a Top 20 hit in the U.S. (#18), but charted lower in the UK (#59). This was a rare occurrence in which one of his singles charted higher in the U.S. than the UK.\n\n1. &quot;Another World&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n2. &quot;Chinatown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n3. &quot;T.V.
