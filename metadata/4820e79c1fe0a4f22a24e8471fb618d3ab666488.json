Recent history has seen an incredible moment in the war between dictators and democracyÃ¢â‚¬â€with waves of protests sweeping Syria and Yemen, and despots falling in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya. But the Arab Spring is only the latest front in a global battle between freedom and repression, a battle that, until recently, dictators have been winning hands-down. The problem is that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authoritarians are not like the frozen-in-time, ready-to-crack regimes of Burma and North Korea. They are ever-morphing, technologically savvy, and internationally connected, and have replaced more brutal forms of intimidation with subtle coercion. The DictatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Learning Curve explains this historic moment and provides crucial insight into the fight for democracy. \nGenre: Politics, History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4820e79c1fe0a4f22a24e8471fb618d3ab666488","amp;dn":"The+Dictator%27s+Learning+Curve+by+William+J.+Dobson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4820e79c1fe0a4f22a24e8471fb618d3ab666488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,32,231,156,31,224,164,242,42,36,232,71,31,182,24,211,171,102,100,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
