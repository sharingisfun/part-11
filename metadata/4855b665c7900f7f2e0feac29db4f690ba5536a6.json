In the decade that followed, CTI, its music, its style, and its discriminating quality transformed contemporary jazz. Taylor assembled and developed an historic roster of artists, supported by a justly acclaimed creative team, headed by engineer Rudy Van Gelder. The CTI roster worked almost like a repertory company, in which great musicians took turns in the spotlight and accompanying each other. The albums they and their colleagues created set new standards in their look as well as their sound. The immediate success of CTI's recordings has echoed across the decades in a profound influence on jazz, pop, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. Remastered for the first time using the original two-track analogue masters, this four-CD set celebrates the vintage years of CTI, when a distinctive style and sound were born. Each disc represents an aspect of CTI's artistic personality -- straight-up jazz, big hits, the Brazilian influence, and cool, classic sounds.\n\nDISC 1: STRAIGHT UP\n01 - Stanley Turrentine - Sugar\n02 - Hubert Laws - Moment's Notice\n03 - Ron Carter - So What\n04 - Chet Baker - Autumn Leaves\n05 - Stanley Turrentine with Milt Jackson - Speed Ball\n06 - Freddie Hubbard - The Intrepid Fox\n07 - Randy Weston - Ifrane\n08 - Don Sebesky feat.
