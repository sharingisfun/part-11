The single has already become a favourite with fans\nand is one of the fastest growing songs on UK radio.\n\nThe new album once again fuses pop, R&amp;B and dance and sees Cheryl working with a\nrange of new producers including Starsmith [Ellie Goulding/Kylie Minogue] Shux\n[Jay Z] and JR Rotem [Rihanna/Jason Derulo]. The album also includes some\nspecial collaborations from Dizzee Rascal on the song \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Everybody Everyone\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and\nTravie McCoy on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Yeah Yeah\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'.\n\nLast year Cheryl Cole firmly established herself as one of the UK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s most\nsuccessful pop stars.
