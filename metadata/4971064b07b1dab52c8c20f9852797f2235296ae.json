In only a few years,\r\nhe's made a substantial impact on the East Coast scene, playing with\r\nsaxophonists Anthony Braxton, Steve Coleman, and Steve Lehman, trumpeters\r\nWadada Leo Smith and Dave Douglas, pianist Vijay Iyer, and many others. As that\r\nlist of collaborators and employers should imply, Sorey is a cerebral and\r\nintrospective player whose work frequently eschews traditional swing for a more\r\nfractured, impressionistic approach to rhythm and the role of percussion in\r\njazz. And when he's working as a leader, his work sometimes has almost nothing\r\nto do with jazz, as this album proves. Koan is performed using guitar, bass,\r\nand drums, and the six pieces, three of which are more than ten minutes each,\r\noccupy a space somewhere between Bill Frisell and Morton Feldman, with a few\r\nhints of recent recordings by Earth thrown in. The guitar and bass ring out,\r\nsingle notes and gently struck chords hanging in the air like coils of smoke as\r\nSorey uses the drum kit as a third melodic device, only rarely attempting to\r\ndrive the other two players in one direction or another. The music's slow\r\nmotion twists and turns occasionally recall European improv, but just as\r\nfrequently hint at chamber music. This is a very beautiful album that seems to\r\nopen up a little more each time it's played.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Mark Corroto \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/koan-tyshawn-sorey-482-music-review-by-mark-corroto.php\r\n\r\nBy Kevin Le Gendre \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/gmcg\r\n\r\nBy Mark Saleski \nhttp://www.blogcritics.org/music-review-tyshawn-sorey-koan/\r\n\r\nBy Doug Simpson \nhttp://www.audaud.com/2009/10/tyshawn-sorey-koan-482-music/\r\n\r\nBy Ben Ratliff \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/arts/music/08guitar.html\r\n\r\nPor Sergio Piccirilli (es) \nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/01/05/tyshawn-sorey-koan/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4971064b07b1dab52c8c20f9852797f2235296ae","amp;dn":"Tyshawn+Sorey+-+Koan+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4971064b07b1dab52c8c20f9852797f2235296ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,113,6,75,7,177,218,181,44,140,32,249,133,39,151,242,35,82,150,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
