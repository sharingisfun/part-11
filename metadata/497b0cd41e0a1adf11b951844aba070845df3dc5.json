GregÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experimental nature led him to try duplicating Beatles string parts on Ukulele. \nLongtime friend, Elliot Easton of the Cars, heard his Uke recording of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEleanor RigbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and suggested he send it to Dick Boak, Artist Relations, at The Martin Guitar Company for their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Favorite Martin Series.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dick Boak loved it, and introduced him to James Jensen at Solid Air Records who suggested doing a whole CD of Beatles songs. \nGreg turned to friend and music producer Perry Geyer at Cybersound in Boston. Together, they produced 15 Beatles song instrumentals (over 45 minutes of music), using multi-tracked ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUKEsymphonicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recordings to create a Ukulele orchestra style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497b0cd41e0a1adf11b951844aba070845df3dc5","amp;dn":"THE+BEATLES+UKE+-+Greg+Hawkes+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497b0cd41e0a1adf11b951844aba070845df3dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,123,12,212,30,10,26,223,17,185,81,132,74,186,7,8,69,223,61,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
