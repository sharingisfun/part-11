With explicit guidance, students learn that the design process is a set of procedures that will help them solve engineering problems. Yousef Haik and Tamer Shahin illustrate the critical steps of the design process, including articulating the problem, market analysis, function analysis, developing concepts, evaluating alternatives, and marketing, while facilitating hands-on learning and teamwork opportunities through labs and class-tested design problems.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 304 pages\n# Publisher: CL-Engineering; 2 edition (May 14, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495668141\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495668145","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4998cc11658ec1d04a5feddca011c61fafdcb71e","amp;dn":"Engineering+Design+Process%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4998cc11658ec1d04a5feddca011c61fafdcb71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,152,204,17,101,142,193,208,74,95,237,220,160,17,198,31,175,220,183,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
