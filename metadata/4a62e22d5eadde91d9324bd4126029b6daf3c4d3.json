As per usual, I didn't see a collected torrent for this week's Marvel NOW! titles yet, so I thought I'd upload one. \nIncluded are:\n\n\nAll-New X-Men 021\nAmazing X-Men 003\nDaredevil 035\nFantastic Four 016\nInhumanity - The Superior Spider-Man 001\nNova 012\nSecret Avengers 014\nSuperior Spider-Man 025\nThor - God of Thunder 017\nThunderbolts 020.NOW\nUncanny X-Force 016\nUncanny X-Men 016\nX-Men Legacy 022\n\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR: DARK ANGEL #1\nPart 2 of &quot;Revolutionary War&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When Shevaun Haldane experiences a troubling vision in Darkmoor Castle, she realizes danger may be coming for the heroes of Marvel UK.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ With time running out, Shevaun has no choice but to suit up as Dark Angel once again.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An adventure that will take fans through the past, present, and future of Marvel UK!\n\n\nI asked both of them on twitter, and Brevoort said the Marvel UK storyline Revolutionary War isn't part of All-New Marvel NOW!, but I'm including it anyway, since Gillen says it's still canon. Also, Revolutionary War is shaping up to be batshit insane, and quite excellent.\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. All my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. I'm tired of Tom Brevoort saying that the reason Marvel needs a reboot every year, but a return to the status quo every time, is because of flagging sales numbers. And if you don't like what's going on, make sure to tell them. They WILL listen, eventually.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a62e22d5eadde91d9324bd4126029b6daf3c4d3","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+61%2FAll-New+Marvel+NOW%21+Week+4+01%2F15%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a62e22d5eadde91d9324bd4126029b6daf3c4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,98,226,45,94,173,222,145,217,50,75,212,18,96,41,182,218,243,196,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
