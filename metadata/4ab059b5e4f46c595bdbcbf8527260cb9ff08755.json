And if you don't, maybe this is the DVD to change your mind.\n\nI've been trying to put up some of the best of my collection, and this one has to be right up near the top.  \n\nIt's a tad over 30 years since this truly historic performance.  This version was available on another tracker, and here it is for you.  \n\nThere are several versions of this show out there, but I personally prefer this Miles Hai restoration, with menus added.\n\nThe bad points - not the greatest image, and it breaks up sometimes, with an occasional minor synch issue.\n\nThe good points - well, it's Bruce on the Darkness tour, and many consider this to be his best show ever.  That should be enough to sway you.\n\nCarve out 3 hours and watch it straight through. If this don't move you, well, maybe you cain't be moved.\n\nCover included.\n\nEnjoy and share!\n\nTrack list:\n\n1)BADLANDS (4.58)\n2)STREETS OF FIRE (4.49)\n3)SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT (6.52)\n4)DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN (4.12)\n5)INDEPENDENCE DAY (5.27)\n6)THE PROMISED LAND (5.23)\n7)PROVE IT ALL NIGHT (9.27)\n8)RACING IN THE STREET (8.03)\n9)THUNDER ROAD (6.28)\n10)MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER (3.16)\n11)JUNGLELAND (9.39)\n12)KITTY'S BACK (12.41)\n13)FIRE (2.52)\n14)CANDY'S ROOM (3.02)\n15)BECAUSE THE NIGHT (6.34)\n16)POINT BLANK (6.33)\n17)NOT FADE AWAY-SHE'S THE ONE (11.27)\n18)BACKSTREETS (11.30)\n19)ROSALITA (10.17)\n20)4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK (SANDY) (6.36)\n21)BORN TO RUN (4.27)\n22)TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT (3.54)\n23)DETROIT MEDLEY (7.22)\n24)RAISE YOUR HAND (4.22)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab059b5e4f46c595bdbcbf8527260cb9ff08755","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+1978-09-19+Passaic+MH+menu+%282+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab059b5e4f46c595bdbcbf8527260cb9ff08755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,176,89,181,228,244,108,89,91,219,203,248,82,114,96,203,159,240,135,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
