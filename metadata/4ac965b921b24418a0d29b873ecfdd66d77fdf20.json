The band was discovered by Mick Jagger while playing a show at punk club CBGB\\'s in 1987.[citation needed] They attacked the Eurocentrism and racism of America with their music and were considered \\&quot;unique\\&quot; by the mainstream media. The fact that Living Colour is an all-black funk metal band drew much attention to the band and the album, which contained three singles and became one of the most popular albums of 1988, reaching #6 on the Billboard 200 and certified double platinum by the RIAA. The band was immediately launched into superstar status and would receive a Grammy for their next studio release. The song \\&quot;Funny Vibe\\&quot; features a cameo appearance from Public Enemy\\'s Chuck D and Flavor Flav. Vivid is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It also contains a cover version of the Talking Heads\\' \\&quot;Memories Can\\'t Wait.\\&quot;\n\n1. \t\\&quot;Cult of Personality\\&quot;\n2. \t\\&quot;I Want to Know\\&quot;\n3. \t\\&quot;Middle Man\\&quot;\n4. \t\\&quot;Desperate People\\&quot;\n5. \t\\&quot;Open Letter (To a Landlord)\\&quot;\n6. \t\\&quot;Funny Vibe\\&quot;\n7. \t\\&quot;Memories Can\\'t Wait\\&quot;\n8. \t\\&quot;Broken Hearts\\&quot;\n9. \t\\&quot;Glamour Boys\\&quot;\n10. \t\\&quot;What\\'s Your Favorite Color?
