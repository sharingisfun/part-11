There are a couple of big names here -- the Kinks (&quot;You Really Got Me&quot;), Tommy James (&quot;Mony Mony&quot;), Mitch Ryder (&quot;Devil With a Blue Dress&quot;), Ritchie Valens (&quot;La Bamba&quot;), Bobby Fuller (&quot;I Fought the Law&quot;) -- but the main attraction of the disc is that it collects one-hit wonders like &quot;Little Bit O' Soul,&quot; &quot;Farmer John,&quot; &quot;Cool Jerk,&quot; &quot;Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out),&quot; &quot;If You Wanna Be Happy,&quot; &quot;Peanut Butter,&quot; &quot;Bottle of Wine,&quot; &quot;California Sun,&quot; &quot;Quarter to Three&quot; and &quot;Hot Pastrami.&quot; There's no better place to get these classic rock &amp; roll singles -- which are some of the greatest rock &amp; roll ever recorded -- in one place than Son of Frat Rock, no matter how silly the title and the packaging may be, and that's why it's essential.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r23190&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r23190&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000348R&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000348R&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
