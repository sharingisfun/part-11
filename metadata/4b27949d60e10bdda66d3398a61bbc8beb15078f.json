Their lavish presidential suite overlooks Monte Carlo, and they surrender: to the sun and pool, to the sashimi and sake, to the Bruno Paillard champagne. For four days they're free to live someone else's life. As the weekend moves into pulsating discos, high-stakes casinos, and beyond, Abbie is transported to the greatest pleasure and release she has ever known.\n\nWhat happened last night?\n\nIn the morning's harsh light, Abbie awakens on a yacht, surrounded by police. Something awful has happened--something impossible, unthinkable. Abbie, Winnie, Serena, and Bryah are arrested and accused of the foulest crime imaginable. And now the vacation of a lifetime becomes the fight of a lifetime--for survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b27949d60e10bdda66d3398a61bbc8beb15078f","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-+Guilty+Wives+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b27949d60e10bdda66d3398a61bbc8beb15078f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,39,148,157,96,225,11,221,166,109,51,152,166,27,188,139,235,21,7,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
