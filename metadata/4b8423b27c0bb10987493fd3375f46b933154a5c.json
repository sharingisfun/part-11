Planet AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Black Belt Theatre with its inspired 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s kung fu flicks hits you in the face like a swift kick from Jim Kelly in Black Belt Jones with the opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lost And Found.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  \n\nAt 35, Fresno, CaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Agent P.A. is still going strong on BBT. Standout tracks that deserve the repeat button are Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fuck RappersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featuring Willie the Kid and Fashawn), the love ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“FurnitureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bruce Lee.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  With guest appearances from Talib Kweli, Raekwon, Ras Kass, Asia reminds us that he is still lyrically sharp and makes sure that he is not outshined on the albums guest tracks.\n\nAlthough BBT is lyrically and musically on point, it does have a few negatives.  With 20 tracks on BBT, some songs just seemed like filler. Tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Diamond LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featuring Camp Lo), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Line of FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been left out.  Overall, Black Belt Theatre is so far one of the best albums to come out this year. Fans of boom-bap and hip hop during the 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s will sure love this album.  Most of the production provided by Dirtydiggs, Khrysis and Oh No hold this effort down.  The overall sound does give the listener a nostalgic feeling, which is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Lost and Found  (02:56), 6.76 MB\n02. Grown Folks Talkin' (Feat.
