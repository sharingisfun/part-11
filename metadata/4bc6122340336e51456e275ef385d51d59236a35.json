K. Chesterton, who stars in 52 short stories, later compiled in five books. Chesterton based the character on Father John O'Connor (1870ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1952), a parish priest in Bradford who was involved in Chesterton's conversion to Catholicism in 1922. The relationship was recorded by O'Connor in his 1937 book Father Brown on Chesterton.\n\nFather Brown is a short, stumpy Catholic priest, &quot;formerly of Cobhole in Essex, and now working in London,&quot; with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella, and uncanny insight into human evil.\n\n\n\nEpisode details &gt; http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/father_brown_stories.html\n\n\nCast: \nAndrew Sachs ......
