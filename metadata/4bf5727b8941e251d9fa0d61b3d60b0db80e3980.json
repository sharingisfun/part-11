About.:\n\nThe story so far: The Campaigner is dead. (Remember, you killed him in Turok 1 \nhopefully without the help of a cheat code). A long, long time ago, a spaceship \ncrashed on Earth. Its cargo, an army of alien warriors headed by the nastiest \nvillain yet, Primagen. Although he is trapped inside his ship, Primagen manages\nto send out his army of creatures and and turns dinosaurs into deadly killing machines. \nLike its predecessor, Turok 2 is a first-person shooter based on Acclaim&amp;#039;s comic-book \nseries -- but with less emphasis on jumping and more on action and exploration than \nTurok 1. This time around, it also will be necessary to go back into certain levels look \nfor more items (Talismans) and open up new passages, making for a better, less \nlinear adventure.\n\n\n\n***As this game was made for the 3dfx glory days you may get a message \n   failed to launch as &gt; glide3xdll &lt; was not found.
