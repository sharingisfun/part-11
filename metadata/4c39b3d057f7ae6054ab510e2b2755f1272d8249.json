As a director and producer, he amazes us with his artistry and technical savvy. As a Hollywood icon, Clint Eastwood, one of film's greatest living legends, represents some of the finest cinematic achievements in the history of American cinema.\n\nIn American Rebel, bestselling author and acclaimed film historian Marc Eliot examines the ever-exciting, often-tumultuous arc of Clint Eastwood's life and career. Unlike past biographers, Eliot writes with unflinching candor about Eastwood's highs and lows, his artistic successes and failures, and the fascinating, complex relationship between his life and his craft. Eliot's prodigious research reveals how a college dropout and unambitious playboy rose to fame as Hollywood' s &quot;sexy rebel,&quot; eventually and against all odds becoming a star in the Academy pantheon as a multiple Oscar winner. Spanning decades, American Rebel covers the best of Eastwood' s oeuvre, films that have fast become American classicsÃ¢â‚¬â€œFistful of Dollars, Dirty Harry, Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and Gran Torino.\n\nFilled with remarkable insights into Eastwood's personal life and public work, American Rebel is highly entertaining and the most complete biography of one of Hollywood's truly respected and beloved starsÃ¢â‚¬â€œan actor who, despite being the Man with No Name, has left his indelible mark on the world of motion pictures.\n\nPublisher: Three Rivers Press; Reprint edition (September 7, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307336891\nISBN-13: 978-0307336897","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c39b3d057f7ae6054ab510e2b2755f1272d8249","amp;dn":"American+Rebel+%3A+The+Life+of+Clint+Eastwood%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c39b3d057f7ae6054ab510e2b2755f1272d8249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,57,179,208,87,247,174,96,84,171,81,14,43,39,85,241,39,45,130,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
