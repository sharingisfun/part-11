Friends, teammates, family members and other players and coaches associated with the subjects are interviewed.\n\nThe name of the series originated in a quote from Steve Sabol of NFL Films:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For a company that prides itself on telling good stories, this is one hell of a story. Dad makes the Hall of Fame. Son's going to be his presenter. Son gets a brain tumor. Now the story is, Is the son going to be there? Will the son make it? Who knows? I could be around until the Super Bowl in New York [2014]. But I've had a lot of time to think ... So they talk about heaven, and I don't know what is waiting for me up there. But I can tell you this: Nothing will happen up there that can duplicate my life down here. That life cannot be better than the one I've lived down here, the football life. It's been perfect.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOriginating as an NFL Network special on the career of Bill Parcells in November 2010, it premiered as an episodic series on September 15, 2011, with the first part of Bill Belichick's documentary. The documentary was viewed by about 657,000 viewers, the most-watched documentary in NFL Network's history, and was the second-most watched program in Boston at the time with 151,000 viewers, trailing behind a Boston Red Sox game. Season One was eventually released on DVD.\n\nThe series was nominated for an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Edited Sports Series/Anthology&quot;[10] and &quot;Outstanding Promotional Announcement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Episodic&quot; for Belichick's episode in 2012.\n\n01 - A Football Life S2 - Tim Tebow\n02 - A Football Life S2 - Ray Lewis\n03 - A Football Life S2 - Tom Coughlin\n04 - A Football Life S2 - Cleveland '95\n05 - A Football Life S2 - Fearsome Foursome\n06 - A Football Life S2 - Steve McNair\n07 - A Football Life S2 - Eddie DeBartolo\n08 - A Football Life S2 - Chris Spielman\n09 - A Football Life S2 - Jimmy Johnson\n10 - A Football Life S2 - John Riggins\n11 - A Football Life S2 - Barry Sanders\n12 - A Football Life S2 - Marcus Allen\n13 - A Football Life S2 - The Immaculate Reception\n14 - BONUS - Steve Sabol Interviews John Riggins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c55648372f3578021e204f8af66e4a2e974e1a7","amp;dn":"A+Football+Life+-+Season+2+%5BNFL+Films%5D+2013+DVD+Rip%2C+Subs%2C+Extra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c55648372f3578021e204f8af66e4a2e974e1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,85,100,131,114,243,87,128,33,226,4,248,175,102,228,162,233,116,225,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
