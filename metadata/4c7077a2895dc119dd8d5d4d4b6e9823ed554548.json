Assembling his film crew, he prepares his production in what promises to be the biggest budgeted feature film using only European financing, although it is meager compared to Hollywood standards. However for all his creativity and enthusiasm, the film is immediately plagued with an improbable series of disasters ranging from scheduling conflicts, budget cuts, studio and location problems and worse that threaten to doom the film.\r\n\r\nWiki: Lost in La Mancha is a 2002 documentary film about Terry Gilliam's unfinished film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a film adaptation of the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. It was shot in 2000 during Gilliam's first attempt to make the film with the purpose of being its making-of, but Gilliam's failure in making the movie led it to be retitled Lost in la Mancha and to be released independently. The documentary received very positive reception from critics.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Fernandez (Production Designer) on Terry Gilliam:\r\nBut I think he's a little bit the Quixote.\r\nHe's the dreamer, the idealist.\r\nThe one who sees things the rest of humans can't see.\r\n\r\nPlease check out other documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Gotham, DC Comics, and more at:\r  https://thepiratebay.org/user// \r  https://kat.cr/user//uploads/ \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7077a2895dc119dd8d5d4d4b6e9823ed554548","amp;dn":"Lost+In+La+Mancha+2002+480p+2ch+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7077a2895dc119dd8d5d4d4b6e9823ed554548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,112,119,162,137,93,193,25,221,141,93,77,75,110,152,35,237,85,69,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
