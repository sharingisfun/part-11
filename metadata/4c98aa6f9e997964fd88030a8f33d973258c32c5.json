He writes that one of the most space-saving and time-efficient ways to enjoy gardening is to include container plantings. They don't take up much room, although they can fill the entire garden. Container planting gives gardeners more control over the specific soil, water, light, and other conditions that plants need to thrive, and they can be used to cover walls and railings. Rogers discusses basic design elements, including color, line, form and mass, space, and texture, and he explores such topics as creating focal points. The plant groups discussed are annuals and perennials, trees and shrubs, cacti and other succulents, tropicals, bulbs, climbers and trailers, and aquatics. Included are 240 splendid color photographs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c98aa6f9e997964fd88030a8f33d973258c32c5","amp;dn":"Pots+in+the+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c98aa6f9e997964fd88030a8f33d973258c32c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,152,170,111,158,153,121,100,253,136,3,10,143,51,217,115,37,140,50,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
