Unfortunately due to time constraints, he was unable to finish the full Lecture.\n\nThis is a must for everyone interested in learning about Stanley Meyers Water Fuel Cell Technology, especially for those people trying to develope there own WFC based on his Technology,but are constantly hindered by the mis-information crowd out and about on the Internet.\n\nAs they say: &quot;Straight from the Horses Mouth&quot;\n\nAlso, be sure to download these torrents as well:\n\n\nCheers! and good luck with your learning and development.\n\nTripled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cbfd7b51db5f21b98c1b32a932986f2d052ba94","amp;dn":"Free+Energy%3A+Stanley+A.+Meyer+-+Water+Fuel+Cell+Technical+Lectur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cbfd7b51db5f21b98c1b32a932986f2d052ba94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,191,215,181,29,181,242,27,152,193,179,42,147,41,134,242,208,82,186,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
