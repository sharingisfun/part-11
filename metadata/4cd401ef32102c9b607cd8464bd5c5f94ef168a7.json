They really know how to jam whether it's pure rock-n-roll or getting bluesy.  I've loved them ever since I saw them on the H.O.R.D.E. tour in 1993 (Walnut Creek Amphitheater in Raleigh, NC and Strawberry Fields Amphitheater in Richmond, VA).  I actually went to 2 shows on that tour.  They were pretty loud and I'm pretty sure I lost some hearing, but that can happen when you're on the \nthird row to the right side of the stage by the speakers.  I've seen them here and there over the years and they still jam and impress the hell out of me.  \n\nDefinitely download this one!!!\n\n\n\n********** BONUS DISK **********\n\nBIG HEAD TODD &amp; THE MONSTERS\n102.1 FM - The Gift of Music\n\nStation sampler 2008 release \n\nCombination of Live Shows and Studio Work\n\n\n\nSource:  Silver CD &gt; EAC &gt; TLH &gt; FLAC8\n\n\n01.
