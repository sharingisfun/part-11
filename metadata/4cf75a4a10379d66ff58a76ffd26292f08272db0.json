Henry V is the story of the newly crowned king of England who fights the French for possession of Normandy. Olivier's direction is inventive, beginning the film as if it were a performance at the Globe Theatre, and having it slowly expand so the final battle scenes take place in realistic settings. Released in 1944 during the height of World War II, Henry V didn't receive an American release until 1946, upon which Olivier won a special Academy Award for &quot;his outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director in bringing Henry V to the screen.&quot; \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036910/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036910/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExtra Subtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-36910/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-36910/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nLaurence Olivier\n\n\n        Leslie Banks\t ... \tChorus\n\tFelix Aylmer\t... \tArchbishop of Canterbury\n\tRobert Helpmann\t... \tBishop of Ely\n\tVernon Greeves\t... \tThe English Herald\n\tGerald Case\t... \tEarl of Westmoreland\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:10:54\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 448x336\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 621 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,17 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf75a4a10379d66ff58a76ffd26292f08272db0","amp;dn":"KING+HENRY+THE+FIFT++%281944%29++Laurence+Olivier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf75a4a10379d66ff58a76ffd26292f08272db0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,247,90,74,16,55,157,102,255,88,167,111,253,38,41,47,8,39,45,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
