The facility was owned and operated by the band's manager and producer, James William Guercio, and eventually became the group's retreat for their next five (non-compilation) long-players. Another and perhaps more significant change was the incorporation of several &quot;outside&quot; additional musicians -- most notably Laudir De Oliveira (percussion), who would remain with the band for the next seven years and eight LPs. Although Chicago had begun as a harder-edged rock &amp; roll band, popular music styles were undergoing a shift during the mid-'70s into a decidedly more middle-of-the-road (MOR) and less-aggressive sound. This is reflected in the succinct pop and light rock efforts, contrasting the earlier lengthy and multi-movement epics that filled their earlier works. Nowhere is this more evident than on Chicago VI's (1973) two Top Ten singles: the easygoing James Pankow (trombone) ballad &quot;Just You &amp; Me&quot; as well as the up-tempo rocker &quot;Feelin' Stronger Every Day,&quot; which Pankow co-wrote with Peter Cetera (vocal/bass). This more melodic and introverted sensibility pervades the rest of the disc as well -- especially from Robert Lamm (keyboard/vocals), who is particularly prolific, penning half of the material on the disc. Even his sardonically titled &quot;Critics' Choice&quot; -- which is undoubtedly a musical rebuttal to Chicago's increasingly negative critical assessment -- is a languid and delicate response, rather than a full-force confutation. &quot;Darlin' Dear&quot; -- another Lamm contribution -- on the other hand, is a horn-fuelled rocker that actually recalls Little Feat more than it does most of Chicago's previous sides. Compositions from other bandmembers include the heartfelt Terry Kath (guitar/vocals) ballad &quot;Jenny,&quot; which features some fluid fretwork much in the same vein as that of Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Castles Made of Sand.&quot; Additionally, Peter Cetera's (bass/vocals) &quot;In Terms of Two&quot; includes a more down-home and countrified acoustic vibe. While Chicago VI is an undeniably strong effort -- supported at the time by its chart-topping status -- many bandmembers and longtime enthusiasts were beginning to grow apart from the lighter, pop-oriented material. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cfc377210782c74b05a7db2c872c4dca4e1fbb4","amp;dn":"Chicago+-+Chicago+VI+%282014%29+%5BTeichiku+Records%5D+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cfc377210782c74b05a7db2c872c4dca4e1fbb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,252,55,114,16,120,44,116,176,90,125,178,200,114,196,220,164,225,251,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
