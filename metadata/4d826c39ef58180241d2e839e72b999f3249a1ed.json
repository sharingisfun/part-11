But when he realizes instead, that his mission is murder - to &quot;eliminate&quot; the Aborigines from a wealthy cattle baron's land - Quigley refuses and quickly turns from hunter to hunted. Forced to wage a savage war against his former employer, Quigley proves that no one gets the best of a steely-eyed American gunfighter - no one, that is, except the mysterious beauty who rides by his side and captures his heart.\n\n~~~ ENGLISH AUDIO, ENGLISH &amp; SPANISH SUBS ~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d826c39ef58180241d2e839e72b999f3249a1ed","amp;dn":"Quigley.Down.Under.DVDRip.WS.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d826c39ef58180241d2e839e72b999f3249a1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,130,108,57,239,88,24,2,65,210,232,57,231,43,153,159,50,73,161,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
