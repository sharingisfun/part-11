Part 2 of the sequel will be shown on 11 March 2012. \n\n\nABOUT THIS TV MOVIE\nWrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II tells the story of Cherry's later years and his evolution into one of Canada's cultural media icons, with Jared Keeso reprising his Gemini Award-winning performance as the host of Coach's Corner. \n\nNo one thought the newly-unemployed coach of the Colorado Rockies would last more than a few weeks as a CBC commentator in 1980, never mind eventually be voted number seven on the all-time list of great Canadians.\n\nWrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II uncovers who Don Cherry really is, the events that shape his past and the key moments in his life that allow him to continue to stay relevant to people today. More than just a broadcaster, Don is controversial, populist, politically involved, a supporter of the troops, and a figure who stirs up emotions of all kinds everywhere he goes.\n\nWrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II will explore the impact Don's outspokenness has had on his Coach's Corner platform, and the attempts that have been made to curb his opinionated nature.\n\n\nABOUT THE FILE NAME\n2HD has been kind enough to release this but they did mess up the file name. They called it &quot;Wrath.of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD&quot;. While this is not the first part of the whole biopic it is the first part of the sequel, &quot;Wrath Of Grapes&quot;. Accordingly the file has been renamed so that there is not too much confusion when part 2 of &quot;Wrath Of Grapes&quot; is released next week.\n\n\nTHE DATA FROM 2HD's NFO\n\n Release Name----- Wrath.of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD\n Release Date----- 03/05/2012\n Release Size----- 700Mb\n Source----------- HDTV\n Play Time-------- 01:30:08\n Resolution------- 624x352\n Frame Rate------- 23.98\n Video Bitrate---- 945kbps\n Video Codec------ XVID\n Audio -----------       48000 Hz 2ch, 128kbps\n Audio Codec------ MP3\n\n\nTHE PREVIOUS PARTS, FROM 2010\n\nKeep.Your.Head.Up.Kid.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.1.HDTV.XviD-2HD &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471738/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5471738/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKeep.Your.Head.Up.Kid.The.Don.Cherry.Story.Part.2.HDTV.XviD-2HD  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5473014/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5473014/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da67365599fdb49083932a0876c14c71f18530b","amp;dn":"Wrath.Of.Grapes.The.Don.Cherry.Story.2.Part.1.HDTV.XviD-2hd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da67365599fdb49083932a0876c14c71f18530b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,166,115,101,89,159,219,73,8,57,50,160,135,108,20,199,31,24,83,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
