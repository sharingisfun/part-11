But for future - all the items that come out between storyline DLCs I will include when the next storyline DLC comes out.\n\n\nAnyway, in this new version of repack I have included the bonus ring called &quot;The Deep Green&quot;, which comes along the DLC &quot;Mark of the Assassin&quot;.\n\n\nIf you want a standalone DLC without having to download the full repack, please use this torrent:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6743978/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6743978/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAnd lets all thank Thompson93, because without his contribution, this would not be possible. And we would still be missing that ring.\n\n\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nTHE INSTALLER WILL AUTOMATICALLY PATCH YOUR GAME TO VERSION 1.03 AND COPY THE CRACK. ALL DLCS ARE PRE-CRACKED. INSTALLER AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS YOUR GAME FOLDER.\n\nYou only need to press &quot;Install&quot;.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nDragon Age II DLC Pack includes the following DLCs:\n\n- Black Emporium\n- Legacy\n- Mage Item Pack\n- Mage Item Pack II\n- Mark of the Assassin\n- Pre-Order Bonus Items\n- Ring of Whispers\n- Rogue Item Pack\n- Rogue Item Pack II\n- Signature Edition Items\n- The Antivan Garrote\n- The Deep Green\n- The Exiled Prince\n- Warrior Item Pack\n- Warrior Item Pack II\n\n\n\nScreenshots (they are from previous version, but new one looks exactly the same):\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJEnAadn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJEnAadn&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DajeOAAdN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DajeOAAdN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe usual warning: some anti-viruses may detect all and every my installers as viruses. This is a false positive. I have no idea why it happens, nor do I care.\n\n\nAlso, Windows Vista/7 may take a couple of minutes to launch this repack, because Vista/7 pre-load large EXEcutable files BEFORE they launch them.\n\n\nYou can share this torrent wherever you want. The more, the better.\n\n\n\n\n-illiria\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da757d80944480271af2e68db3c73ae59fc3f29","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+Complete+DLC+Re-Pack+%28%2B+The+Deep+Green%29+-illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da757d80944480271af2e68db3c73ae59fc3f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,167,87,216,9,68,72,2,113,175,46,104,219,60,115,174,89,252,63,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
