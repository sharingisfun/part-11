But Britain entered the 1980s bitterly divided over its future. At stake were the souls of the great population boom of the 1960s. Would they buy into the free-market, patriotic agenda of Thatcherism? Or the anti-racist, anti-sexist liberalism of the new left? From the miners' strike, the Falklands War and the spectre of AIDS, to Yes, Minister, championship snooker and Boy George, Rejoice! Rejoice! steps back in time to relive the decade when the Iron Lady sought to remake Britain. What it discovers is a thoroughly foreign country.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de41ebd2cb69e0a70aee6902ca85d0117cca26f","amp;dn":"Rejoice%21+Rejoice%21+Britain+in+the+1980s+by+Alwyn+W.+Turner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de41ebd2cb69e0a70aee6902ca85d0117cca26f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,228,30,189,44,182,158,10,112,174,230,144,44,168,93,1,23,204,162,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
