Adapted for modern knitters, the ambitious designs offer eye-catching patterns, unique silhouettes, and a palette of techniques ranging from intarsia and Fair Isle to embroidery and beading. Skilled knitters will find plenty of contemporary flair in projects such as a boldly striped geometric scarf, a showy lace cardigan with ruffled trim, and a crocheted poncho embellished with beads. Photographs of the stunning Peruvian landscape and stories about the tradition of Andean craft and the vital alpaca enrich this tour of beautiful art from a beautiful country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de5f86f0a670754b1fc5cda205e8c473c3898ef","amp;dn":"Andean+Inspired+Knits%3A+Designs+in+Luxurious+Alpaca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de5f86f0a670754b1fc5cda205e8c473c3898ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,229,248,111,10,103,7,84,177,252,92,218,32,94,140,71,60,56,152,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
