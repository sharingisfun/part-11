The torrent-serie which comes most close to the perfect Hitzone-uploads so far. These are ALL Hitzone albums (it's now March 2010) in outstanding quality. \n\nSome albums are in FLAQ, some in high quality MP3. I can assure you most of the tracks are beyond wicked audio-quality. Forget the rest of the Hitzone-torrents on TPB posted before this time, I'm quite sure this is what you want. It will take some time downloading it, but enjoy this fantastic collection by listening to pure music-history; more than 73 hours of the greatest hits from 1998 to 2010 in fancy quality.\n\nThe total file-size is too big to fit all the albums in one single torrent, so I decided to seperate them. This torrent is the final part 4 (Hitzone 46 - 52).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4deba24e6fdf8c3693616b9968221c2be93b0d38","amp;dn":"%5BVarious%5D+4%2F4+All+Hitzone+%5C%27s+in+great+audio-quality+%2846+-+52%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4deba24e6fdf8c3693616b9968221c2be93b0d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,235,162,78,111,223,140,54,147,97,107,153,104,34,28,43,233,59,13,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
