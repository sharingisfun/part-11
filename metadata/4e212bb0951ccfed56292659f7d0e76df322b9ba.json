Also contained are the Pearson Lab Manuals B &amp; C, which offer invaluable assistance and templates on how to write all modes and patterns of paragraphs (B) and essays (C).\n\nThere are many guides or workbooks like these, but these are (in my professional opinion as a college instructor) the best I have seen. A college bookstore would charge around $250 to $300 for these all together. I have also included some homemade and stolen (borrowed?) documents that walk any students through commas, capitalization, quotations, and sentence diagramming.\n\nThis torrent should be immensely useful to any high school or college student, as well as for parents who home school.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writersreference-seventhedition-hacker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writersreference-seventhedition-hacker&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJcEAaDB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJcEAaDB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA Writer's Reference, the most widely adopted handbook in the United States, continues to be groundbreaking in its simplicity, offering the right content in an accessible format.

The lab manual provides exercises that encourage students to apply key concepts covered in most writing classes (i.e., topic sentences, thesis statements, coherence, unity, levels of development).  Analysis exercises give further illustration of concepts explained in class and in the primary textbook; Building exercises give students the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œraw materialsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to develop paragraphs and/or essays along the various modes. Revision prompts encourage students to look at specific key elements of their own writing and assess whether they have met the needs of their reading audience.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPaperback: 82 pages\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPublisher: Longman; 1 edition (March 2, 2009)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLanguage: English\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tISBN-10: 0205693415\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tISBN-13: 978-0205693412\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e212bb0951ccfed56292659f7d0e76df322b9ba","amp;dn":"Developmental+Writing+How-To+Resource+%28multiple+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e212bb0951ccfed56292659f7d0e76df322b9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,33,43,176,149,28,207,237,86,41,38,89,247,208,231,109,243,34,185,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
