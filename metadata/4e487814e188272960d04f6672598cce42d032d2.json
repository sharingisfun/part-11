The fact it's edited isn't noticeable.... sounds like a professionally faded out ending to the track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e487814e188272960d04f6672598cce42d032d2","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+2009+-+Relapse+-+Torrent+by+LuKe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e487814e188272960d04f6672598cce42d032d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,72,120,20,225,136,39,41,96,208,79,102,114,89,140,206,66,208,50,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
