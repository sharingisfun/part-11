Now they are loaded &quot;one after the other&quot; to smoothen the approach/scenery loading \n\n- both texture sets (normal and HighRes) have been reworked to provide a smooth approach without stuttering and loading times during approach\n\n- the high resolution textures should now also run on average systems \n\n- small update on the AFCAD file: Gates at T1 were corrected to match with AES \n\n- faster download: The file size of the downloadable full version decreased from 148 to 60 MB \n\n- blue runways changed to greyer ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e55980c85731e8ad1e31db15483c1b622a993b8","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Aerosoft+-+London+Heathrow+2008+v1.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e55980c85731e8ad1e31db15483c1b622a993b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,85,152,12,133,115,30,138,209,227,29,177,84,131,193,182,34,169,147,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
