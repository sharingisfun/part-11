With skillfully chosen instruments and Anis' sonorous vocals, their music gives off an atmosphere that can best be described as alternative rock. MONORAL's lyrics show one of the peculiarities of the band, being wholly in English and consequently helping to promote their work to their fan base outside of Japan.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In Stereo\nRelease: 2001.07.25\n01.
