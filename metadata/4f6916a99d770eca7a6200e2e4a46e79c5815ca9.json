Not only does Jane not have the time to date anyone, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even going to consider making herself vulnerable to another man after being deserted by her husband.

For starters, everything Jane no longer sees in herself. As she dares to take the flirtation to the next step, Jane finds herself back where she never wanted to beÃ¢â‚¬â€falling for another man. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Will to convince Jane that she has everything he wants in a woman, and that the second time around can be the best time of all.\n\nIncludes previews of Jaci BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Hope novel Hope Ignites and her new Play-by-Play novel, Straddling the Line \n\nHope Smolders previously appeared in Hot Summer Nights","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f6916a99d770eca7a6200e2e4a46e79c5815ca9","amp;dn":"Hope+Smolders+%28Hope+0.5%29+by+Jaci+Burton+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f6916a99d770eca7a6200e2e4a46e79c5815ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,105,22,169,157,119,14,202,122,98,0,226,228,164,110,121,197,129,92,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
