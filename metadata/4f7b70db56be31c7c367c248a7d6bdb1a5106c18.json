The Catholic Archbishop is released and sent to Rome, where the ailing Pope makes him a Cardinal. The world is in a state of crisis - a famine in China is exacerbated by United States restrictions on Chinese trade and the ongoing Chinese-Soviet feud. When the Pontiff dies, Lakota finds himself elected Pope. But the new Pope Kiril I is plagued by self-doubt, by his years in prison, and by the strange world he knows so little about. This movie contains extensive information about Catholic faith &amp; practice, as a television news reporter steps in from time-to-time to explain the procedures involved in selecting a new Pope.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063599&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063599&lt;/a&gt;\n\nQuality: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: DivX 5\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 1.268 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 91 kbps  32 KHz\nResolution: 608 x 272\nAspect Ratio: 2.235\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\nSize: 1,36 Gb\nLeght: 148 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7b70db56be31c7c367c248a7d6bdb1a5106c18","amp;dn":"The+Shoes+of+the+Fisherman_1968_Anthony+Quinn_Subs+Eng%2C+PtBr%2C+Sp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7b70db56be31c7c367c248a7d6bdb1a5106c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,123,112,219,86,190,49,199,195,103,194,72,167,214,189,177,165,16,108,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
