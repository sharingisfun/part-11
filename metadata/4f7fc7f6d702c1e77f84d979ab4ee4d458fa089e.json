Noted for her aggressive, rock-influenced approach, Shakira maintained an extraordinary degree of creative control over her music, especially for a female artist; she wrote or co-wrote nearly all of her own material, and in the process gained a reputation as one of Latin music's most ambitiously poetic lyricists. When she released her first English material in late 2001, she became an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7fc7f6d702c1e77f84d979ab4ee4d458fa089e","amp;dn":"Shakira+%28Deluxe%29+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7fc7f6d702c1e77f84d979ab4ee4d458fa089e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,127,199,246,215,2,193,231,127,132,217,121,171,78,228,212,88,250,8,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
