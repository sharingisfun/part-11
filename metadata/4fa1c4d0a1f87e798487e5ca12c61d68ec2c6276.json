It focuses on India's peculiar socio-political processes under colonialism that influenced the evolution of such thoughts. The distinguishing feature of this book is its linking of the text of Indian political thought with the context. In doing so, it challenges the ethno-centric interpretation of nationalism that despite its roots in western Enlightenment, evolved differently because of the context in which it was articulated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa1c4d0a1f87e798487e5ca12c61d68ec2c6276","amp;dn":"Modern+Indian+Political+Thought+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa1c4d0a1f87e798487e5ca12c61d68ec2c6276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,161,196,208,161,248,126,121,132,135,229,202,18,198,29,104,236,44,98,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
