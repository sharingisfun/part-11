That is what it?s like to dream lucidly, teaches Stephen LaBerge. In this new book/CD, he teaches his simple, proven methods for becoming fully conscious in the dream state.. with expert instruction gleaned from LaBerge?s 20 years of pioneer in research at Stanford University, now anyone can learn to consciously explore and use their dreams for self-discovery, creativity, fantasy fulfillment, emotional healing, and profound spiritual insights. CD includes two complete guided dream induction sessions.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nfrom my own experience it also helps to get less sleep- say 6 hours instead of 8. that way you spend more time in both realities!\n\n\nsafe all, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t kill my torrent by taking without seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fb3221af97ea63af088522aa95add162bb36a29","amp;dn":"Steven+LaBerge+-+Lucid+Dreaming+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fb3221af97ea63af088522aa95add162bb36a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,179,34,26,249,126,166,58,240,136,82,42,169,90,221,22,43,179,106,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
