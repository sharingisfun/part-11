When Humanoids Publishing secured the rights for a translated American edition, it wisely decided to run the prequel first, allowing the events to unfold chronologically for the first time.\n\nAlso, taking advantage of artistic technological advances since the seriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ inception, the American edition has been completely recolored and is a vast improvement over the garish coloring of the original European edition. But the smartest move of all was to provide the series in an accessible, relatively inexpensive comics format rather than a graphic novel, making it more enticing to new readers. The only drawback of this is that the story doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t necessarily lend itself to being broken into 22-page chunks, and the end of each issue is somewhat jarring. [I fixed that ;]\n\nAmerican audiences may feel that the future urban backdrop is inspired by Ridley ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blade Runner but would do well to remember that the film came out the year following the initial release of The Black Incal. This is an excellent piece of work showcasing two of EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many excellent and overlooked creators and shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be missed by fans of true comic-book storytelling.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jim Johnson @ http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/titledetail.aspx?TitleID=23791 [my insertions ;]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503a767d059c0b4e79aa258449d095c83d0b7a26","amp;dn":"Jodorowsky+%26+Janjetov+-+%5BBefore%5D+The+Incal+-+Complete+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503a767d059c0b4e79aa258449d095c83d0b7a26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,58,118,125,5,156,11,78,121,170,37,132,73,208,149,200,61,11,122,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
