She is truly gifted and is truly using her talent to the fullest. Her songs are absolutely beautiful and puts in so much work to them and it is clearly obvious when you listen to the beauty of what her and God have made. Keep on going Amanda!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5051bbfc65197ae1b6d515e74bacf53855f1caa0","amp;dn":"Amanda+Cook+-+Brave+New+World+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5051bbfc65197ae1b6d515e74bacf53855f1caa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,81,187,252,101,25,122,225,182,213,21,231,75,172,245,56,85,241,202,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
