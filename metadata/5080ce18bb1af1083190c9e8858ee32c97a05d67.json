The group here features the great trio with Eddie Gomez on bass and Marty Morell on drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and unlike some other live Evans albums of this nature, which tend to mike the piano more than the rhythm, this one really has all three points of the trio coming out strongly together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially Gomez' wonderfully rich, round tones on the bass. Titles include &quot;Two Lonely People&quot;, &quot;What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life&quot;, &quot;Re Person I Knew&quot;, &quot;Elsa&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Turn Out The Stars&quot;, and &quot;Quiet Now&quot;.\n\nDuring the last decade of his life, Bill Evans had developed such a devoted fan base that many of his performances were audience-recorded, particularly when he toured Europe. This previously unissued concert was recorded in Groningen, The Netherlands with the approval of the pianist's manager Helen Keane, but remained in private hands until its release four decades later. \n\nThe music was well recorded and the tapes were properly stored, so there is no problem from aging. Evans' trio with bassist Eddie Gomez and drummer Marty Morell is in top form throughout this concert, while the repertoire will be familiar to the leader's fans. \n\nThe pianist is in a reflective mood, especially on his introspective &quot;Re: Person I Knew.&quot; Evans' former bassist Scott LaFaro had died tragically just days after the trio's historic Village Vanguard recordings, but LaFaro's driving &quot;Gloria's Step&quot; remained in Evans' repertoire for the rest of his life; Gomez's adept playing is a highlight of this hard-charging performance. Composer/pianist Denny Zeitlin believes that Evans' performance of his requiem-like ballad &quot;Quiet Now&quot; is among the finest interpretations of Zeitlin's well-known work.\n\nThe second set finds the trio stretching out a bit more, with a brisk take of &quot;My Romance&quot; and a sparkling rendition of Evans' delicate ballad &quot;Sugar Plum.&quot; The pianist's emotional side is prominent in his ballad &quot;The Two Lonely People&quot; and the moving take of Michel Legrand's timeless ballad &quot;What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,&quot; while he turns &quot;Who Can I Turn To&quot; into a playful, upbeat celebration, showcasing Gomez's brilliant solo. Sadly, the engineer ran out of tape before the trio could complete their inevitable closing number, a tense setting of Miles Davis' modal masterpiece &quot;Nardis,&quot; which became a signature song for the pianist not long after he recorded it as a sideman with Cannonball Adderley. The detailed liner notes by several contributors provide additional historical and critical perspective.\n\n\nRecorded Live Stadsschouwburg, Groningen, Netherlands, February 4, 1972\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - Re- Person I Knew\n02 - Elsa\n03 - Turn Out The Stars\n04 - Gloria's Step\n05 - Emily\n06 - Quiet Now\n\nCD2\n01 - My Romance\n02 - Sugar Plum\n03 - The Two Lonely People\n04 - Who Can I Turn To\n05 - What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life\n06 - Nardis\n\n*2012 Limetree Records | MCD 0043\n\n\nPersonnel:\nBill Evans, piano\nEddie Gomez, bass\nMarty Morell, drums\n\n\n\n\nMore Bill Evans Albums:\n\nBill Evans - The Interplay Sessions (1962) [EAC-FLAC] :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10947782/Bill_Evans_-_The_Interplay_Sessions_%281962%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10947782/Bill_Evans_-_The_Interplay_Sessions_%281962%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans - Live At Ronnie Scott's 1980 [2CD] (1992) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8863184/Bill_Evans_-_Live_At_Ronnie_Scott_s_1980_%5B2CD%5D_%281992%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8863184/Bill_Evans_-_Live_At_Ronnie_Scott_s_1980_%5B2CD%5D_%281992%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans Trio - The 1960 Birdland Sessions (2005) [EAC-FLAC] :\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8852024/Bill_Evans_Trio_-_The_1960_Birdland_Sessions_(2005)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8852024/Bill_Evans_Trio_-_The_1960_Birdland_Sessions_(2005)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans and Don Elliott - Tenderly An Informal Session (2001) [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8849263/Bill_Evans_and_Don_Elliott_-_Tenderly_An_Informal_Session_(2001)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8849263/Bill_Evans_and_Don_Elliott_-_Tenderly_An_Informal_Session_(2001)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans - The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961 (2005)[3CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8845646/Bill_Evans_-_The_Complete_Village_Vanguard_Recordings_1961_(2005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8845646/Bill_Evans_-_The_Complete_Village_Vanguard_Recordings_1961_(2005&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans Trio &amp; Guests - Live In Nice 1978 [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8759239/Bill_Evans_Trio__amp__Guests_-_Live_In_Nice_1978__[2CD]__[EAC-FL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8759239/Bill_Evans_Trio__amp__Guests_-_Live_In_Nice_1978__[2CD]__[EAC-FL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Evans Trio - Since We Met (1974) [EAC-FLAC]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8856102/Bill_Evans_Trio_-_Since_We_Met_(1974)__[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8856102/Bill_Evans_Trio_-_Since_We_Met_(1974)__[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
