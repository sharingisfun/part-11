It has since been deleted and removed from the shelves due to WWE?s legal troubles with the World Wide Fund, but I have ripped the event from the original WWF DVD, which means there are no, I repeat, NO censorship of the WWF ?scratch? logo or mentions of the WWF name. Redling is the ONLY guy who can give you pre-2002 events in DVD-quality.\n\nSunday, July 22, 2001\nGund Arena\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nTHE INAUGARAL BRAWL:\nTeam WWF: Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Undertaker, Kane &amp; Chris Jericho\nvs\nTeam WCW/ECW: Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, The Dudley Boyz and Rhyno\n\nTAG TEAM BRA &amp; PANTIES MATCH:\nTrish Stratus and Lita\nvs\nTorrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler\n\nWWF HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP:\nJeff Hardy\nVs\nRob Van Dam\n\nYoshihiro Tajiri\nvs\nTazz\n\nBig Show, Billy Gunn &amp; Albert\nvs\nKanyon, Hugh Morrus &amp; Shawn Stasiak\n\nWilliam Regal\nVs\nRaven\n\nWCW CRUISERWEIGHT VS WWF LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP:\nX-Pac\nVs\nBilly Kidman\n\nWCW TAG-TEAM vs WWF TAG-TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP:\nFarooq and Bradshaw\nVs\nChuck Palumbo and Sean O?Haire\n\nWWF referee Earl Hebner\nVs\nWCW referee Nick Patrick\n\nEdge and Christian\nVs\nMike Awesome and Lance Storm\n\n\nRemember, guys, I?m doing this for you for FREE, so I expect something from you in return.
