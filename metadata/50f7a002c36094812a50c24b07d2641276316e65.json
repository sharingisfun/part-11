Originally released on A&amp;M Horizon (850) \n\n&quot;When the Dave Brubeck Quartet broke up in 1967, Paul Desmond worked sporadically playing live dates, probably in part due to his substantial royalty income from his hit composition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTake Five.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  When Jim Hall was unavailable to play with Desmond in Canada, he recommended guitarist Ed Bickert who, like Hall, is a brilliant accompanist with the kind of musical that Desmond had with Brubeck.  Bassist Don Thompson ( who is also a fine pianist and vibraphonist ) and drummer Jerry Fuller round out this solid quartet, which worked off and with Desmond when he played in Canada during the remainder of his life.  These sessions, drawn from several nights at Bourbon Street in Toronto during the fall of 1975, are intimate performances enjoyed by attentive audiences.  The selections include songs that Desmond had recorded with Brubeck or Gerry Mulligan, along with tunes he had played on his own records.  DesmondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cool tone and witty quotes are a treat throughout the album. &quot;\n\nSure, it's a cliche, but this would be the jazz CD that I'd want with me on a desert island. This album has it all! The horn work is flawless. Desmond's improvised lines come across as complete statments, thought out, but never sounding pre-planned. His solo on 'Wave' has some astounding lines while his composition entitled 'Wendy' has developed a cult following of its own.\nBeing a guitarist I naturally am very interested in Ed Bickert's work. Filling the slot once occupied by Jim Hall would be daunting, but the guitar work on this album is more than adequate for the task. Mr. Bickert can improvise melodies in chord form that would be difficult to play as single-note lines. I simply have never heard anything quite like it. \n\nDon Thompson holds down the bottom end with inventiveness and creativity while never sacrficing his reliability. His solos are tastefull and complete. He fits in well with the rest of the group and makes a solid contribution.\n\nJerry Fuller is up to the challenge of holding together the rhythms of this quartet. This drummer is never obtrusive but always present. Substance prevails over pyrotechnics.\n\nIv'e owned a copy of this album since '77 and still listen to it often. After all of this time there are still gems that jump out of a solo and amaze me. Putting this out on CD was truly a service to the jazz community. ~ Mark Sorensen\n\nPersonnel: \nPaul Desmond, Alto saxophone \nEd Bickert, Guitar \nDon Thompson, Bass \nJerry Fuller, Drums \n\nPaul Desmond Quartet - Live Tracks: \n01  Wendy 7:18\n02  Wave 11:23\n03  Things AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t What They Used to Be 8:59\n04  Nancy (With the Laughing Face) 9:40\n05  Manha de Carnaval 9:28\n06  HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That Rainy Day 7:18\n07  My Funny Valentine 10:35\n08  Take Five 7:18 \n09  Line for Lyons 7:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f7a002c36094812a50c24b07d2641276316e65","amp;dn":"Paul+Desmond+Quartet+-+Live+%281975%29++%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f7a002c36094812a50c24b07d2641276316e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,247,160,2,195,96,148,129,42,80,194,75,7,210,100,18,118,49,110,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
