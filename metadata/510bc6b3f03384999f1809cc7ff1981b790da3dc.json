It seems the book contains secret knowledge - and the Fae will do just about anything to keep it out of the wrong hands.\n\nAnd if that doesn't take enough of Mercy's attention, her friend Samuel is struggling with his wolf side - leaving Mercy to cover for him, lest his own father declare Sam's life forfeit.\n\nAll in all, Mercy has had better days. And if she isn't careful, she might not have many more to live.\n\nHave Mercy: listen to another Mercy Thompson chiller.
