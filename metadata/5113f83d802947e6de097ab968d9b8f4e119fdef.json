To do this, select Options from the Skyrim Launcher and clicking the Default button in the Detail section.  \n\nAdditionally, there are several things you can do to increase game performance.\n\n-Make sure you have no other programs running in the background.\n\nIn the Skyrim Launcher:\n-Switch to LOW or MEDIUM Detail settings. Select Advanced for more detail options.\n-Turn Anti-Aliasing and/or Anisotropic Filtering down or off.  This may degrade overall visual quality but will improve framerate.\n-Lower the game resolution.  The title will run faster at smaller resolutions.\n\n\nINPUT\n-ALT+TAB may cause some game instability with some hardware configurations and is not advised.\n\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n     4.
