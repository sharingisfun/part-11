J. A. Mooij (Author)\nHardcover: 304 pages\nPublisher: Brill Academic Pub; 1St Edition edition (March 30, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9004141529\nISBN-13: 978-9004141520\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nThis book deals with the history of a central problem in the philosophy of time: Can time exist without mind or consciousness, and if not, in what respects? Aristotle was the first to formulate this problem, and it has been intensively discussed ever since. This book analyses the answers and arguments and sets them in their historical context. Although there have been very different approaches, the book shows important continuities as well. Besides being a specialist monograph, it can be used in courses on the philosophy of time in general, or on the realism/idealism debate.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJ.J.A.
