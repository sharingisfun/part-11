Between 1965 and 1973, Ellington wrote three massive works that combined elements of jazz, classical music, choral music, spirituals, gospel, blues and dance.\nHe called them his &quot;sacred concerts,&quot; and they were performed in churches and cathedrals around the world. He said it was the most important music he'd ever written.\nBecause of the scale of the music and the sheer number of artists needed to execute each work, Ellington's sacred concerts have rarely been performed in the 30 years since his death in 1974.\n\n\nDisc 18\n\n1  In the Beginning God  19:59 *\n2  Tell Me It's the Truth  2:47 \n3  Come Sunday  3:53 *\n4  The Lord's Prayer  2:42 *\n5  Come Sunday  6:05 *\n6  Will You Be There?/Ain't Butthe One  4:41 *\n7  New World A-Comin'  8:25 *\n8  David Danced Before the Lord 6:29 *\n9  Ninety Nine Percent  1:52 \n10  My Mother, My Father and Love  3:57 \n11  New World A-Comin'  8:18 \n12  A Christmas Surprise  3:50 \n13  A Christmas Surprise 3:28\n\n *  Duke Ellingtons Concert of Sacred Music\n\n\nRecorded at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church on December 26, 1965.\nReleased; 1966\n\nPersonnel\n\nDuke Ellington ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nCat Anderson, Mercer Ellington, Herb Jones, Cootie Williams - trumpet\nLawrence Brown, Buster Cooper, Quentin Jackson - trombone\nChuck Connors - bass trombone\nRussell Procope, Jimmy Hamilton - alto saxophone, clarinet\nJohnny Hodges - alto saxophone\nPaul Gonsalves - tenor saxophone\nHarry Carney - baritone saxophone\nJohn Lamb - bass\nLouie Bellson - drums\nBrock Peters, Ester Marrow, Jimmy McPhail - vocals\nThe Herman McCoy Choir - choir\nBunny Briggs - tapdancing (track 10)\n\nDisc 19\n\n1 Praise God 3:09 \n2 Supreme Being  11:46 \n3 Heaven  4:54 \n4 Something 'Bout Believing  8:14 \n5 Almighty God  6:33 \n6 The Shepherd  7:10 \n7 It's Freedom  13:02\n8 Meditation   3:12 \n9 The Biggest and Busiest Intersection  3:58 \n10 T.G.T.T.
