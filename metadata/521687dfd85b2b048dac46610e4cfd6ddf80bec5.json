DJ Introduction\n2. Eriatarka\n3. DJ Chat\n4. Obelisk\n5. Cicatriz\n6. DJ Outro\n\nLineage:\nDVB-T\nTopfield TF5800 PVR\n.rec file (Transport Stream)\nUSB\nPC\nProjectX\nmp2 file (192kbps)\nmp3directcut (Trim start and end)\nmp2 file\n\nNotes:\n\nThe DJ says this is from 2004, but it appears that they didn't tour the UK in\n2004 so this seems unlikely. I've found a reference to a Maida Vale session 3rd\nSeptember 2003 which is most probably this one based on comparison of the tracks\nlisted at one of the torrent sites.\n\nThe tracks broadcast originally, surrounded by an interview, were:\nEriatarka\nCicatriz ESP Part 1\nCicatriz ESP Part 2\n\nSo I assume that the unbroadcast track was the 30 minute+ Obelisk.\n\nTwo Maida Vale tracks were released on a live EP in 2003, Roulette Dares (The\nHaunt Of) and Drunkship of Lanterns, but these are not included in this session.\nCiacatriz ESP is on the EP but is from a Live performance rather than a Maida\nVale Session based on what I've read on the web. I've searched as best as I can\nand can't fine any record of these tracks being released.\n\nThis was broadcast on Rob Da Bank &amp; Friends special called Raiders Of The Lost\nArchives broadcast BBC Radio 1 on 29th December 2008 where 'rare' sessions were\nbroadcast (others were Mogwai, Radiohead, see http://bbc.co.uk/radio1/robdabank/\ntracklistingarchive.shtml?081229_friends_raiders).\n\nEvidently the Mars Volta recorded over an hour of music for this session and\nthis was the first time it had been broadcast in its entirity.\n\nI tried splitting the chat from the music, but the DJ chats over the end of each\ntrack slightly and I didn't feel I could do it satisfactorily using my limited\nknowledge of mp3directcut, so its torrented as a single file.\n\nRadio 1 broadcasts on FM, DAB, Digital Satellite and Cable. This is a direct\ncapture of the mp2 stream from the DVB-T recording.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sonicyouth.com/gossip/showthread.php?t=28804&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sonicyouth.com/gossip/showthread.php?t=28804&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta_tours&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta_tours&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:521687dfd85b2b048dac46610e4cfd6ddf80bec5","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta+-+2003-08-27+London%2C+GB+-+BBC+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"521687dfd85b2b048dac46610e4cfd6ddf80bec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,22,135,223,216,91,43,4,141,172,70,97,14,76,253,109,223,128,190,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
