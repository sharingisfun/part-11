K. Rowling.\n\nEdition language English \n\nRelease date: 27 September 2012 \n\nPublished by Little, Brown and Company \n\n512 pages\n\nIt is her first novel published since the Harry Potter series, her first apart from that series, and her first novel for adults. \n\nWhen Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.\nPagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty faÃƒÂ§ade is a town at war.\nRich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils... Pagford is not what it first seems.\nAnd the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5277d112a714076b956616eb2310a5d79973521a","amp;dn":"The+Casual+Vacancy+-+J.+K.+Rowling+%28Epub-Mobi%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5277d112a714076b956616eb2310a5d79973521a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,119,209,18,167,20,7,107,149,102,22,235,35,16,165,215,153,115,82,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
