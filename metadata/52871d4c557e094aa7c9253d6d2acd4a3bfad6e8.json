On one hand, it lets you create a creature and guide its maturation from a single cell to a galactic civilization through an unusual process of evolutionary development. Because the tools used to create and revise this creature are so robust and amusing, and each creation's charms are so irresistible, it's hard not to get attached to your digital alter ego. On the other hand, this intimacy is abandoned in the long, later portions of the game, when you lead your full-grown civilization in its quest for universal domination. The idea sounds ambitious, though Spore isn't as much a deep game as it is a broad one, culling elements from multiple genres and stripping them down to their simplest forms. By themselves, these elements aren't very remarkable; but within the context of a single, sprawling journey, they complement each other nicely and deliver a myriad of delights.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52871d4c557e094aa7c9253d6d2acd4a3bfad6e8","amp;dn":"Spore+-+DutchReleaseTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52871d4c557e094aa7c9253d6d2acd4a3bfad6e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,135,29,76,85,126,9,74,167,201,37,61,109,42,205,74,59,250,214,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
