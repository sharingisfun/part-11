Cui bono? Warmongers and zionists.\n\nThe 1,336 lb (606 kg) urea nitrateÃ¢â‚¬â€œhydrogen gas enhanced device was intended to knock the North Tower (Tower One) into the South Tower (Tower Two), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so, but did kill six people and injured more than a thousand.\n\nDan Rather became an icon of U.S. news media during his 45-year career as one of America's most famous and respected news anchors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has now retired and is speaking out about the inherent danger to democracy, and rapid deterioration of American news media.\n\nSays Rather, &quot;[Our failing news media] comes down to this: In the current model of big, conglomerate corporate ownership, the incentive to produce good and valuable news is simply not there. What has changed most is the character of news ownership. For example, the pressure of the White House of the late President Richard Nixon during my coverage of the Watergate crimesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦pressure to call me off that story. Back then, my bosses took the heat so that the story could get told...so that the public could be informed. But this [freedom to report on such high-level crimes] is rare, now.&quot;\n\nAs well, Rather reveals that &quot;America's biggest, most important news organizations have fallen prey...to merger after merger, acquisition after acquisition, to the point where [news outlets] are now tiny parts of immeasurably large corporate entities...entities whose vast array of business interests have nothing to do with news. The overall reigning mandate [of these corporate entities] is to provide a return on shareholder value, and to increase profits.&quot;\n\n&quot;American news is in need of a spine transplant. Let the treatment begin todayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦take this message to your colleagues and your fellow citizens. Magnify it, multiply it, and spread it.&quot;\n\nv=8ckeqIoZz9c // v=hDsFBAF0X6A\n\nVideo Transcribed here:\n\n &quot;Last winter the FBI was praised for it's speed in cracking the case of the World Trade Center bombing, and bringing four suspects to trial. Now, there is some evidence that the FBI might have known of the plot in advance, through an informant, and might, might even have stopped the bombing that killed six people. Correspondent Jaqueline Adams has the story.&quot; ~ Dan Rather\n\n &quot;FBI agents might have been able to prevent last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center. They discussed secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, BUT THEY DIDN'T, according to the FBI's own informant Emad Salem. Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time, Salem recorded many of his conversations with his handlers.&quot; ~ Jaqueline Adams\n\n &quot;I'm holding 903 pages of draft transcripts..&quot; ~ William Kunstler\n\n &quot;William Kunstler represents Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and several others, charged with conspiring to blow up a series of New York City landmarks, four months after the World Trade Center bombing. That case has not yet gone to trial. Kunstler confirmed newspaper reports of the Salem transcripts. In one, Salem complains to an FBI agent: 'Since the bomb went off, I feel terrible. I feel bad. I feel here is people who don't listen.' Agent: 'Hey, I mean, it wasn't like you didn't try and I didn't try. You can't force people to do the right thing.&quot; ~ Jaqueline Adams\n\n &quot;There is material in here that shows gross governmental misconduct&quot; ~ William Kunstler\n\n &quot;Today, attorneys for the defendants in the ongoing World Trade Center bombing case formally asked for the transcripts of Salem's tapes&quot; ~ Jaqueline Adams\n\n &quot;Quite frankly, it is beyond me why now, the fourth week of the trial, we still don't have these materials.&quot; ~ Robert Precht\n\n &quot;Prosecutors have refused to comment publicly, but legal experts say the defense may have no right to those transcripts.&quot; ~ Jaqueline Adams\n\n 9/11 THE FALLiNG MAN (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmerica Rebuilds (2002)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Loss Of Liberty: The USS Liberty (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8422553/The_Loss_Of_Liberty__The_USS_Liberty_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8422553/The_Loss_Of_Liberty__The_USS_Liberty_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n (seeds please)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e9ba9aa409a3be929fab02d4d6978696930f95","amp;dn":"Dan+Rather%3A+FBI+Could+Have+Prevented+WTC+Bombing+%28RARE%2C+1993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e9ba9aa409a3be929fab02d4d6978696930f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,233,186,154,164,9,163,190,146,159,171,2,212,214,151,134,150,147,15,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
