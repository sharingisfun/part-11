He is a co-founder of Royal Southern Brotherhood that features Cyril Neville, Devon Allman, Charlie Wooton and Yonrico Scott.\n \nZito started singing at the age of five and by his late teens he had begun his career in the St Louis area music scene.

He was born in Canton, Mississippi, and settled in Lafayette, Louisiana. He lives in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nBlitzen Trapper is a Portland, Oregon-based experimental country/folk band associated with Sub Pop Records,Vagrant Records and Lojinx. Formed in 2000, the band currently operates as a quintet, with Eric Earley (guitar/harmonica/vocals/keyboard), Erik Menteer (guitar/keyboard), Brian Adrian Koch (drums/vocals/harmonica), Michael Van Pelt (bass), and Marty Marquis (guitar/keyboards/vocals/melodica).\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSpirit Family Reunion play homegrown American music to stomp, clap, shake and holler with. Ever since they started singing together on the street corners, farmer's markets and subway stations of New York City, their songs have rung-out in a pure and timeless way. When Spirit Family Reunion gather to sing, there is communion. Strangers and neighbors come to rejoice in the sound, and there is no divide between performer and spectator.\n \nIn a strange barroom or a grand music hall, at a barn dance or on the sunny street corner, Spirit Family Reunion keep the book open, and that old familiar feeling that was almost lost is again new.\n \n&quot;Dusty acoustic guitars, wailing fiddles and weeping accordions, with a woozy-yet-skintight rhythm section-- and topped off with burr-edged vocals that sound like they've been soaked in a Mason jar for generations -- it's the type of music that blurs the line between past and present so thoroughly, and so deftly, that time feels irrelevant.&quot;\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nDead Man Winter is fronted by Dave Simonett on vocals and guitars and band mate Frankie Lee on bass, vocals and percussion. Simonett is also a member of Trampled By Turtles.\n \nTrampled By Turtles is an American band from Duluth, Minnesota. The band members have referenced inspirations such as Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana and Ralph Stanley. Their fifth release, Palomino, maintained a position in the Top 10 on the Billboard bluegrass charts for 52 straight weeks. Their music has been featured in TV shows including Deadliest Catch and Squidbillies. Their song Alone was featured at the end of the 2013 movie The Way Way Back. Their album, Stars and Satellites, was released on April 10, 2012 and debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200 Chart and number 11 on the Alternative Chart. Their latest album, Wild Animals, was released on July 15, 2014.\n \nThe band has performed at many national festivals including Coachella, Stagecoach, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Bumbershoot, and Pickathon. In 2011, they performed at several large folk festivals such as Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival and ROMP roots and branches.

His style has been compared to Otis Redding. The Daily News wrote that Lee's was &quot;one of the most energetic blues voices of any time or place&quot;.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nLeRoux (a.k.a. Louisiana's LeRoux) is a pop/rock band founded in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA that saw its heyday from 1978 to 1984. Their best-known songs were &quot;Take a Ride On a Riverboat&quot; with its 4-part a capella intro, the regional smash &quot;New Orleans Ladies&quot;, &quot;Nobody Said It Was Easy (Lookin' For the Lights)&quot; (their highest charting single), &quot;Addicted&quot;, and &quot;Carrie's Gone&quot;. Their early music, though pop-oriented, combined many elements such as funk, R&amp;B, Dixieland jazz, rock, and some Cajun flavoring, thus defying a pigeonhole into one definable category, like many other diverse Louisiana artists common to an area known for its many musical influences and tastes. After recording the album Up in 1980, they became a noteworthy exponent of the developing AOR sound. The band continues to perform live throughout the U.S., mostly at fairs and festivals in the Louisiana area.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nMichael John &quot;Duke&quot; Robillard (born October 4, 1948, Woonsocket, Rhode Island) is an American blues musician.\n \nAfter playing in various bands and working for the Guild Guitar Company, he co-founded the band Roomful of Blues with pianist Al Copley in 1967. He has also been a member of The Fabulous Thunderbirds which included Kim Wilson, replacing Jimmie Vaughan on guitar. Also experienced in jazz, swing, and rock and roll, aside from his preferred blues music, Robillard has been generally regarded as a guitar player keeping the blues style of T-Bone Walker.\n \nHe has recorded with artists such as Jimmy Witherspoon, Snooky Prior, Jay McShann, Hal Singer, Pinetop Perkins, Joe Louis Walker, Todd Sharpville, Tom Waits and Bob Dylan. In the summer of 2006, Robillard accompanied Tom Waits on a tour of the Southern United States.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \nFrom Amazon:\n \nI found out about this from being a fan of Trampled by Turtles. I saw this and did a little research to find out that Dave Simonett is the lead singer for both bands! I've been loving this album ever since! If you're a fan of Trampled by Turtles, I can almost guarantee you'll find some enjoyment out of this album! \n \nTwang-laced power-pop and indiepop from Minnesota with a very low-key, brainy vibe... I'd place this more in the &quot;rock&quot; landscape, but the swampy-twangy guitars and squeaky fiddle licks are a nice touch. If you enjoyed Thad Cockrell's solo stuff, you might like this as well. Sweet stuff.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nWill Wilde picked up his first harmonica at the age of 16 and played it until his lips bled. Weaned on the likes of Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson and Buddy Guy, Wilde grew up steeped in traditional Chicago Blues yet his focus as an artist remains resolutely on the future. Wilde fuses raw blues with rock, soul and funk. He takes what's authentic and powerful about the music he grew up loving and introduces other influences without losing the heart and conviction of the blues. His live show has been described as: &quot;A masterclass of blues harp playing, bar none.&quot; (Blues in the North West). \n \nWilde made his first album when he was 19, Nothing but Trouble, which was well reviewed in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlues MattersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlues in BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. In 2011 he signed a two album deal with Rock the Earth Records. His first album with Rock the Earth, Unleashed, is described as: &quot;An exemplary album with an extraordinary variety of styles&quot; (Bluesbreeker NL) and &quot;Pure, simple and low-down... vocal in classic Sam Cooke Mode&quot; 8/10 (Blues in Britain).\n \nOn his latest album Raw Blues, Wilde returns to his roots paying homage to the stripped down Chicago blues that first inspired him to play. Raw Blues features Richard Newman on drums (Rory Gallagher, Steve Marriot, Sam Brown), Stuart Dixon on guitar (Eddie Floyd, Geno Washington, Marcus Malone) and Victoria Smith on Bass (Girls with Guitars, Dani Wilde, The Ramonas).\n \nWilde has been four times nominated in the British Blues Awards for best Harmonica player (2010/2011/2012/2013) and he has shared the stage with various notable blues artists. He has appeared twice on the Legendary Blues Cruise playing with veterans such as Sherman Robertson, Michael Burks, Earl Thomas and Taj Mahal. \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSmokin' Joe Kubek (born November 30, 1956) is an American Texas blues electric guitarist, songwriter, and performer.\n \nBorn in Grove City, Pennsylvania, Kubek grew up in the Dallas, Texas area. In the 1970s during his teen years, he played with the likes of Freddie King and in the 1980s began performing with Louisiana-born singer, Bnois King.\n \nIn 1985, Kubek released his first record on Bird Records, a 45 RPM single with the tracks &quot;Driving Sideways&quot; (written by Freddie King and Sonny Thompson) and &quot;Other Side Of Love&quot; (written by Doyle Bramhall, Sr.). The single was executively produced by Clint Birdwell and co-produced by Charley Wirz and Kubek. The two tracks reappeared on Kubek's 2012 album, Let That Right Hand Go, produced by Clint Birdwell and issued on Birdwell's label, Bird Records Texas. The album is a collection of mostly unreleased material recorded since the 1980s (with the 1985 single's track, &quot;Other Side Of Love&quot;, entitled &quot;The Other Side Of Love&quot;).\n \nIn 1991, Kubek released his first full-length album entitled Steppin' Out Texas Style (Bullseye Blues Records) and has since released over a dozen albums on various labels.\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nFrom Web:\n \nSmokin' Joe Kubek &amp; Bnois King\n \n&quot;King's vocals are like aged whiskey, smooth and mellow, with a warm glow that spreads throughout your body when you partake.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Blues Revue Magazine\n \n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦the intricate interplay between their differing guitar styles is truly impressiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Living Blues Magazine\n \n&quot;Kubek and King bring a full course meal to the dinner table. With this dynamic duo from Dallas you get great songwriting, two distinctive approaches to the guitar and a singer in Bnois King with a voice and vocal style that delivers the message like very few in the modern blues world.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Blues Junction\n \nDelta Groove Music is extremely pleased to welcome the dynamic duo of SmokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Joe Kubek and Bnois King to the Delta Groove family. With over two decades of experience together on stages and in studios around the world, and over a dozen major CD releases, Kubek and King bring the essence of Texas blues to Delta Groove.
