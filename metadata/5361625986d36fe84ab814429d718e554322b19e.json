Kenrick\nCategory: Academic/Sexuality/Psychology/Cultural Studies\nPublisher: Basic Books (April 26, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0465020445\nISBN-13: 978-0465020447\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;In Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life, social psychologist Douglas Kenrick exposes the selfish animalistic underside of human nature, and shows how it is intimately connected to our greatest and most selfless achievements. Masterfully integrating cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and complexity theory, this intriguing book paints a comprehensive picture of the principles that govern our lives. As Kenrick divulges, beneath our civilized veneer, human beings are a lot like howling hyenas and barking baboons, with heads full of homicidal tendencies and sexual fantasies. But, in his view, many ingrained, apparently irrational behaviorsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as inclinations to one-night stands, racial prejudices, and conspicuous consumptionÃ¢â‚¬â€ultimately manifest what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deep Rationality.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlthough our heads are full of simple selfish biases that evolved to help our ancestors survive, modern human beings are anything but simple and selfish cavemen. Kenrick argues that simple and selfish mental mechanisms we inherited from our ancestors ultimately give rise to the multifaceted social lives that we humans lead today, and to the most positive features of humanity, including generosity, artistic creativity, love, and familial bonds. And out of those simple mechanisms emerge all the complexities of society, including international conflicts and global economic markets. By exploring the nuance of social psychology and the surprising results of his own research, Kenrick offers a detailed picture of what makes us caring, creative, and complexÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, fully human.\n\nIlluminated with stories from KenrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own colorful experiences -- from his criminally inclined shantytown Irish relatives, his own multiple high school expulsions, broken marriages, and homicidal fantasies, to his eventual success as an evolutionary psychologist and loving father of two boys separated by 26 years -- this book is an exploration of our mental biases and failures, and our mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great successes. Idiosyncratic, controversial, and fascinating, Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life uncovers the pitfalls and promise of our biological inheritance.&quot;\n\nReviews:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Douglas Kenrick is one of the most important scientists studying the evolutionary shaping of human drives and emotions. By highlighting the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own research, this lively book introduces readers to new evidence on how the mind works, presented in a cohesive framework.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -Steven Pinker, Professor of Psychology, Harvard University; Author of How the Mind Works, The Language Instinct, and The Stuff of Thought\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“KenrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift for speaking directly to the reader and making the abstract concrete through humor and homely examples make [Sex, Murder, and The Meaning of Life] an accessible and engaging exploration of how human behavior is connected to the behavior of our primitive ancestors.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -Kirkus Reviews\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
