The hedgerows, meadows, streams and woods are bursting at the seams with free food. Not just in the country either as Allen also explores the urban confines in search of free food. So, just before you start on this pleasant journey, please have a quick think about the benefits of foraging for food:\n\nEnvironmentally Friendly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No ploughed fields, no tractors and trucks and distribution centres. No supermarkets burning energy at all hours of the day\n\nCost Ã¢â‚¬â€œ It's free. Or very cheap indeed. All it takes is your time and that is spent walking in the countryside. Now, there's a joy all on it's own. It's good exercise too.\n\nHealthy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Not only do you get the above mentioned exercise, your diet is naturally improved and packed full with nutritional diversity.\n\nFresh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You can't get fresher than just picked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537a9e758b7337b8ca8c6ddaa3914cdfb17ff299","amp;dn":"How+To+Forage+For+Free+Food+-+Let%27s+Get+Foraging+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537a9e758b7337b8ca8c6ddaa3914cdfb17ff299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,122,158,117,139,115,55,184,202,140,109,218,163,145,76,223,177,127,242,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
