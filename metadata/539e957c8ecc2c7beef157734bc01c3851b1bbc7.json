Still featuring the talents of lead vocalists Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi, Grouplove tend toward creating passionate, anthemic pop moments that are equal parts post-MGMT indie soul and post-Killers dance-rock. Songs &quot;Tongue Tied,&quot; &quot;Spun,&quot; and &quot;Love Will Save Your Soul&quot; have a rollicking, post-punk exuberance while more hippie-dippy cuts such as &quot;Colours&quot; and &quot;Naked Kids&quot; (a carry-over from the EP) bring to mind such psychedelic touchstones as the Flaming Lips and late-'60s Beach Boys. In that sense, Grouplove also fit nicely next to such similarly inclined contemporaries as Local Natives, New Villager, and Black Kids. Ultimately, Grouplove's Never Trust a Happy Song is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539e957c8ecc2c7beef157734bc01c3851b1bbc7","amp;dn":"GROUPLOVE+-+Never+Trust+a+Happy+Song+%282011%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539e957c8ecc2c7beef157734bc01c3851b1bbc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,158,149,124,142,204,44,123,238,241,87,115,75,192,28,56,81,177,187,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
