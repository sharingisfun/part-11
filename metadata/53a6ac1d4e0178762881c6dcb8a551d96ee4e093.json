His style of banjo playing, as well as his singing, is considered a unique combination of Appalachian folk music and African-American blues. Contemporary folk musicians and performers consider him a seminal figure, at least in part because of the appearance of two of his recordings from the 1920s, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and &quot;Country Blues&quot;, on Harry Smith's 1951 Anthology of American Folk Music collection. Boggs was initially recorded in 1927 and again in 1929, although he worked primarily as a coal miner for most of his life. He was &quot;rediscovered&quot; during the folk music revival of the 1960s, and spent much of his later life playing at various folk music festivals and recording for Folkways Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a6ac1d4e0178762881c6dcb8a551d96ee4e093","amp;dn":"Dock+Boggs+-+Vol.2+%281965%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a6ac1d4e0178762881c6dcb8a551d96ee4e093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,166,172,29,78,1,120,118,40,129,198,220,184,165,81,217,110,228,224,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
