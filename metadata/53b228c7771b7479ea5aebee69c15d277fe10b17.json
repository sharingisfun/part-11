Self-taught on the guitar, flute and cello, at age 16 Seb heard the album 'Songs from the Victorious City', a collaboration between Anne Dudley and Jaz Coleman (Killing Joke), and became fascinated with the fusion of middle eastern music and western production.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b228c7771b7479ea5aebee69c15d277fe10b17","amp;dn":"Kaya+Project+-+Walking+Through","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b228c7771b7479ea5aebee69c15d277fe10b17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,178,40,199,119,27,116,121,234,90,235,238,105,193,93,39,127,225,11,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
