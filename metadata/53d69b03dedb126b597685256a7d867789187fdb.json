Most of Robeson's movies are at TPB, but this documentary about the making of them isn't.\n\nRobeson couldn't get a decent job in his own country, but he became a stage superstar in England. The English naturally thought of using his talents to beef up their small film industry, and this set a precedent for black actors finding their &quot;big break&quot; in British cinema. It is a complex story, and this documentary goes into more detail than I possibly could. Robeson was good friends with Nkrumah and Kenyatta during his time in London - there is room for even more to be said on the subject, if anyone is interested.\n\nI can put up more Robeson if this gets a good response.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53d69b03dedb126b597685256a7d867789187fdb","amp;dn":"True+Pioneer+-+The+British+Films+of+Paul+Robeson.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53d69b03dedb126b597685256a7d867789187fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,214,155,3,222,219,18,107,89,118,133,37,106,125,134,119,137,24,127,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
