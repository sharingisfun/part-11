Based on a true story, the film focuses on the AlabamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two-time Academy AwardÃ‚Â®-winner Tom Hanks, Best Actor, 1993, Philadelphia; Best Actor, 1994, Forrest Gump), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. The two men are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target PhillipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.\n\n  \n- Actors\nTom Hanks\nBarkhad Abdi\nBarkhad Abdirahman\nFaysal Ahmed\nMahat M.
