All of the album is beautifully performed, but parts of it are overproduced. Cat needs a dozen good songs a lot more than he needs a dozen background singers right now.&quot; ***1/2\n- Janet Maslin, Rolling Stone\n\n\n&quot;In &quot;Music,&quot; for example, Cat tells us there wouldn't be any &quot;wars in the world/If everybody joined in the band.&quot; This kind of lie is called a tautology; it's like saying there wouldn't be any hunger if everyone became an ice cream man. And makes you wonder why a guy who loves trees so much (reference: &quot;King of Trees&quot;) designed a double-fold cover With cardboard inner sleeve for this unlovable single LP.&quot; C-\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53fee6f26e15177289483f9e93fdb76674a6839f","amp;dn":"Cat+Stevens+-+Buddha+and+the+Chocolate+Box+%281974+quad+mix+24%2F96+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53fee6f26e15177289483f9e93fdb76674a6839f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,254,230,242,110,21,23,114,137,72,63,158,147,253,183,102,116,166,131,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
