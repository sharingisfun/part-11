Even if it is not\r\na language you plan or want to use for the rest of\r\nyour life, you will appreciate it in years to come when you\r\nstart to find your desired programming path. C++ is the\r\nintellectual predecessor of Java and C#\r\n\r\nThere are Infinite reasons explaining why learning C++ is\r\nImportant, Some are:\r\n\r\n* Nearly all of the books in science and technology have their\r\ncode samples written in C/C\r\n* C/C++ compilers are known to produce more efficient\r\nmachine code than any other compilers (with\r\nfortran perhaps being the exception)\r\n* There are billions of lines of code already\r\nwritten in C++. Your possibilities for code reuse\r\nare huge!\r\n* Well defined ISO standard that is updated by a\r\ngroup of experts from time to time. (It's not a &quot;frozen&quot;\r\nlanguage)\r\n* Supported on most platforms, from microcontrollers (actually\r\nC language) to cellphones\r\n* Virtually all of the operative systems are coded in C s\r\n* It's like learning Latin to understand English better. A lot of\r\nlanguages were modeled on the syntax and constructs, for\r\nexample C#, Java, JavaScript, etc. Picking up C++ will give you a\r\nhead start by teaching you the common denominator\r\nbetween all those languages\r\n* Understanding the things that are abstracted away\r\nfrom you in other languages (pointers, basic data\r\nstructures, garbage collection) theoretically\r\nmakes you a better programmer even if you don't\r\ndirectly tinker in the details\r\n* It doesn't happen every day, but one day you are\r\ngoing to need to connect directly to a C++ program API from\r\nyour high level language. It will help if you have at least a\r\npassable knowledge of C++ when this happens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542536322e9ca7a941db63d296e5ec6ddb4433ea","amp;dn":"Udemy+C+Plus+Plus+Step+By+Step+Training+For+Beginners+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542536322e9ca7a941db63d296e5ec6ddb4433ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,37,54,50,46,156,167,169,65,219,99,210,150,229,236,109,219,68,51,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
