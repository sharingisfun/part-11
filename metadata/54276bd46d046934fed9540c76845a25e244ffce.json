E. Burroughs, Shirley J. Hansen\nFairmont Press | 3 April 2008 | ISBN: 1420071556 | 359 pages | PDF \n\nMore than ever, health, economic, and legal matters associated with Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) seem destined to remain a dominant problem for developers, owners, and managers of commercial and institutional properties. Indoor air problems have definitely made the jobs of engineers and facility managers more difficult and put owners at greater risk.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of its three bestselling prior editions, Managing Indoor Air Quality, Fourth Edition continues to monitor concerns over IAQ now at the forefront of many current workplace problems. Extensively updated and edited to reflect the rapid growth in the IAQ industry, this book encompasses the gamut of contaminants, thermal conditions, and other factors that contribute to, or detract from, occupant comfort and a productive workplace.\n\nA Thorough Handbook for Facility Operations and Maintenance Practitioners\n\nMaintaining a focus on IAQ issues from a management perspective, this book steers clear of overly detailed data and technical lingo. It is meant to be a practical desk reference for owners, managers, operators, and/or anyone responsible for operating and maintaining a facility. Design professionals, too, benefit from the information contained between these covers, as well as those who offer owners technical and financial support.\n\nThis valuable resource cuts across multiple professions, taking a broader and more widely applicable approach by avoiding the specificity and bias of any one discipline. It includes rich IAQ history and new practical, pragmatic suggestions throughout its procedural guidelines all the while operating under the realization that the IAQ problem is real and, unfortunately, not going away.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tCONTENTS\n\nPREFACE ix\n\n1 INDOOR AIR QUALITY: AN OVERVIEWÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½WHERE ARE WE? 1\nThe Building as a Habitat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ When Buildings Become Sickening\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Why Now?
