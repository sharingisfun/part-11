It's a weary, drug-laden album -- well over half the songs explicitly mention drug use, while the others merely allude to it -- that never fades away, but it barely keeps afloat. Apart from the classic opener, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (a gleeful tune about slavery, interracial sex, and lost virginity, not necessarily in that order), the long workout &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and the mean-spirited &quot;Bitch,&quot; Sticky Fingers is a slow, bluesy affair, with a few country touches thrown in for good measure. The laid-back tone of the album gives ample room for new lead guitarist Mick Taylor to stretch out, particularly on the extended coda of &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking.&quot; But the key to the album isn't the instrumental interplay -- although that is terrific -- it's the utter weariness of the songs. &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is their first non-ironic stab at a country song, and it is a beautiful, heart-tugging masterpiece. Similarly, &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; is a ravished, late-night classic that ranks among their very best blues. &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is a horrifying overdose tale, and &quot;Moonlight Mile,&quot; with Paul Buckmaster's grandiose strings, is a perfect closure: sad, yearning, drug-addled, and beautiful. With its offhand mixture of decadence, roots music, and outright malevolence, Sticky Fingers set the tone for the rest of the decade for the Stones.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://31.media.tumblr.com/74be0017dc1ccd3bc9c739760144a595/tumblr_mq88krscZZ1r5mbvpo1_500.jpg[/img]\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1 Brown Sugar\n2 Sway\n3 Wild Horses\n4 Can't You Hear Me Knocking\n5 You Gotta Move\n6 Bitch\n7 I Got the Blues\n8 Sister Morphine\n9 Dead Flowers\n10 Moonlight Mile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5433c17400e28835c8c6544b5a75808bc5243054","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Sticky+Fingers++%5BFLAC%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5433c17400e28835c8c6544b5a75808bc5243054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,51,193,116,0,226,136,53,200,198,84,75,90,117,128,139,197,36,48,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
