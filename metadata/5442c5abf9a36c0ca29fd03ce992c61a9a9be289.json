TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re cute, compact, fun-loving, and great with kids. (Not to mention those soulful eyes!) But their sense of humor, independence, and stubborn nature isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t for everyone. So whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re thinking about getting your very own Snoopy-dog, or if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already opened your heart and home to one, Beagles for Dummies answers important questions like:\n\n    * What are Beagles supposed to look like and how should they behave?\n    * Should I choose a puppy or an adult dog? Male or female?\n    * How do I correct my BeagleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behavior problems?\n    * What do I need to do to survive my BeagleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s puppyhood?\n    * How can I Beagle-proof my house to keep him (and my stuff) safe?\n    * What should I teach my Beagle to do? How do I teach him?\n    * What health problems is my Beagle likely to have when heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s young? How about when he grows upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or gets old? \n\nLife with these little hounds can lead to years of merriment, entertainment, and loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but if you think Beagles are just another hound dog, think again! Whether you want to know everything there is to living with a Beagle, or just want to skip to a relevant subject (like how to keep him out of the hamper), Beagles for Dummies gives you everything you need to choose and raise your Snoopy soul mate.\n\nMore details\nBeagles For Dummies\nBy Susan McCullough\nEdition: illustrated\nPublished by For Dummies, 2006\nISBN 0470039612, 9780470039618\n288 pages\n\nBrowse at http://books.google.com/books?id=N7EHnPunkZ4C","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5442c5abf9a36c0ca29fd03ce992c61a9a9be289","amp;dn":"Beagles+For+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5442c5abf9a36c0ca29fd03ce992c61a9a9be289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,66,197,171,249,163,108,12,162,159,208,60,233,146,198,26,154,155,226,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
