These stories display real craft, and feel as if they're actually _about_ something. \n\nThey're not just about gruesome deaths and perverse cruelty, they're about real people; they sometimes surprise by being about compassion and love. And in place of the simple stomach-churn lesser authors settle for, Etchison wants to disturb you; you may find yourself still getting a chill three days after reading one of these gems. Etchison is one of the few contemporary writers in this genre who has the potential to stand the test of time.\n\nGenre: Horror","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54704fef15360eebc462caf83710a6cfd16e60b4","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Country+by+Dennis+Etchison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54704fef15360eebc462caf83710a6cfd16e60b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,112,79,239,21,54,14,235,196,98,202,248,55,16,166,207,209,110,96,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
