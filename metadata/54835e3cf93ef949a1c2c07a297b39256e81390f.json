Interwoven with these are tales of everyday life on Harley Street, including a flower delivery service and a cycle courier delivering medical samples, as well as an interview with the director of the estate that owns almost all the property in the area and allocates leases to doctors wishing to practise here.\n\n2)  Make Me Beautiful \nThis episode explores the rise of cosmetic medicine in the area. Every kind of cosmetic procedure is available on Harley St, from botox to cosmetic surgery to hair transplants, all at a price. The film examines the doctors' motivations and values - cosmetic surgeon Angelica Kavouni operates on women to make them look younger and considers herself a feminist. Surgeon Greg Williams left the NHS after 25 years helping burns victims in order to work exclusively in the private sector doing hair transplants. The film follows local estate agent Jeremy Cohen, who specialises in renting out medical properties and also features a specialist shoe shop that makes hand-made orthopaedic shoes for people with serious mobility problems.\n\n3)  Make Me Well \nThe third and final episode in this documentary series from acclaimed director Vanessa Engle introduces the practitioners on Harley Street who offer complementary and alternative therapies. Harley Street may be best known as a centre for private medical care, but paradoxically, it's also a destination for those who don't put their faith in conventional medicine. Certain patients in this film travel to Harley Street as a last resort: 36-year-old May Lyang has been trying to have a baby for 5 years and comes to see Dr Zhai, who offers traditional Chinese medicine for fertility. Other patients use complementary medicine to address issues such as stress and fatigue. Identical twins Luba and Irena Chmil regularly visit kinesiologist Dr Michael Culp to fend off the exhaustion of daily life with young babies. Alex Adler, an American financial consultant, has intravenous vitamin infusions to maintain peak performance. Also featured in this episode is a company called Viavi, a new type of business on Harley Street, which offers a comprehensive health evaluation and optimisation programme. For a fee of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£10,000, busy executives can proactively manage their health in the same way that they might manage their careers or their finances.\n\nScreen15.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;afe7c6c8c7efe39b819e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3029 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 134 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.31 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54835e3cf93ef949a1c2c07a297b39256e81390f","amp;dn":"BBC.Inside.Harley.Street.3of3.Make.Me.Well.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54835e3cf93ef949a1c2c07a297b39256e81390f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,131,94,60,249,62,249,73,161,194,192,122,41,123,57,37,110,129,57,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
