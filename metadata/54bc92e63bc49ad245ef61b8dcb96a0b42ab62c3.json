In July 1975, after several name changes and recording contracts Smokie had a top-five UK hit with 'If you think you know how to love me'. Further success followed with a total of 15 top 20 hits including 'Living Next door to Alice' which was No. 1 in Germany for nine weeks. The band sold in excess of 30 million records worldwide.\n \nIn 1986 Chris Norman embarked on a solo career and a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnew lookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Smokie arrived on the scene, complete with ChrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s replacement Alan Barton. Alan breathed new life into Smokie, who went from strength to strength, adding new fans to their already loyal following.
