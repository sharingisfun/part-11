In clear, spirited prose, Bloom argues that the social and political crises of contemporary America are part of a larger intellectual crisis: the result of a dangerous narrowing of curiosity and exploration by the university elites.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Allan Bloom was Professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the College and co-director of the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. He taught at Yale, University of Paris, University of Toronto, Tel Aviv University, and Cornell, where he was the recipient of the Clark Teaching Award in 1967. He died in 1992","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54cae69e57248c530b30df2662dbbce6cd2757c0","amp;dn":"The+Closing+of+the+American+Mind+-+Allan+David+Bloom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54cae69e57248c530b30df2662dbbce6cd2757c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,202,230,158,87,36,140,83,11,48,223,38,98,219,188,230,205,39,87,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
