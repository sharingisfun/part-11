This course is designed for beginning to intermediate Python users.\r\nYou will start by learning about data structures, including the dict type, problem statements, terms, and how to create a dict. From there, James will teach you how to interact with the set type, such as type constructing, comprehension, and indexing. Finally, this video tutorial covers list and tuple types, including the list type, how to create a list and tuple, and semantics.\r\nOnce you have completed this computer based training course, you will have gained a solid understanding of the built-in data types in Python. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:558fefcacd250d9934363ab5a94360a17f0e593e","amp;dn":"O%27Reilly+-+Python+Data+Structures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"558fefcacd250d9934363ab5a94360a17f0e593e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,143,239,202,205,37,13,153,52,54,58,181,169,67,96,161,127,14,89,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
