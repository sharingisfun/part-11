Speedwagon) is an American rock band. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n------------\nEarly Years:\n------------\n\nWith their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend's station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. The band's debut album, R.E.O. Speedwagon, was released on Epic Records in 1971. The most popular track on this record was &quot;157 Riverside Avenue&quot;. The title refers to the Westport, Connecticut address, where the band stayed while recording in Leka's studio in Bridgeport and remains an in-concert favorite.\n\nAlthough the rest of the band's line-up remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for Starcastle. He was replaced by Kevin Cronin. Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972's R.E.O./T.W.O. but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973's Ridin' the Storm Out because of internal conflicts. Ridin' the Storm Out was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal. Murphy stayed on for two more albums, Lost in a Dream and This Time We Mean It, before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded R.E.O., which was released that same year.\n\nCronin's return came after Greg X. Volz turned down the position for lead vocalist due to his commitment to Christianity and Volz would instead go on to accept an offer made by Bob Hartman to join his band Petra as lead vocalist.\n\nIn 1977 REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album, Live: You Get What You Play For, which was certified platinum.\n\nIn 1977 Philbin was replaced with Bruce Hall to record You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish, released in 1978, which received FM radio airplay. The album was REO's first to make the Top 40, peaking at #29. The album sold over 2 million copies in the US, achieving double platinum status.\n\nIn 1979 the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of Nine Lives.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis Time We Mean It is the fifth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1975. It peaked at number 74 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1975, It was the third and last album to feature Mike Murphy on vocals. The CD version of the album has been out of print for many years, but produced the single &quot;Reelin'&quot; (written by Murphy).\n\nThe art style on the cover of the album is remarkably similar to the art style of Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist, Alfons Mucha.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nR.E.O. is the sixth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1976. It peaked at number 159 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1976,[3] It marked the return of Kevin Cronin to the band after a four-year absence. Five of the songs (&quot;Keep Pushin&quot;, &quot;Any Kind of Love&quot;, &quot;(Only A) Summer Love&quot;, &quot;(I Believe) Our Time Is Gonna Come&quot;, and &quot;Flying Turkey Trot&quot;) were featured on the band's subsequent live album, Live: You Get What You Play For. Many fans refer to the album as C.O.W. (or simply COW) due to the background of the cover art.\n\nThis was the band's last studio album to feature original bassist and founding member Gregg Philbin; he would be replaced on the following studio album You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish, by bassist Bruce Hall. This album is co-sung by both Kevin Cronin and Gary Richrath. On previous albums (Ridin' the Storm Out, Lost in a Dream, This Time We Mean It) Richrath would generally only sing one song; however on this album he equally shares the vocal duties with Cronin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55c4b67c4c61bb460a6249bc6fa0eeb804d0e833","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+This+Time+We+Mean+It-REO+%5B2010%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55c4b67c4c61bb460a6249bc6fa0eeb804d0e833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,196,182,124,76,97,187,70,10,98,73,188,111,160,238,184,4,208,232,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
