Arizona Territory. A stranger with no memory of his past \nstumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is\n a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the \npeople of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its \nstreets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's\na town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can \nscarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. \nScreaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the \nhelpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever \nknown. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this \ngunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been...\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/217/erYEE2b8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/217/erYEE2b8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/1328/xeIVPOov.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/1328/xeIVPOov.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/49/E3fWtjsq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?lookpic.com/O/i2/49/E3fWtjsq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nEncoders note: \nFirst QEBS6 encode.  Fixed compatibility, improved quality, large size reduction.\nFASM 720p releases  have display resolution 1280x720 and have special HRTF \ntransformed STEREO sound converted from 5.1 BluRay source.Just imagine the file \nwhich is small enough, have great quality, which you can play on multiple devices\nfrom smartphones to large TVs directly, without the need to using some special \nconverting software. If you can imagine that you have the idea of whats offering\nyou FASM 720p RIP.\nWanna know how good the video commpression can be, check this out :)\n\nCheck out the new instruction for fixing your player problems.\nRegards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew\n, Filix, Rok3r, Kempas, Stun, Askeen, Faolanscath and all who likes my work.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nREMEMBER!\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they\n   are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your\n   gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the\n   nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO\n   from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those\n   movies at the significant worse quality!! If you have any problems with your\n   video player check &quot;Instruction for fixing your player problems&quot; folder.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this\n   release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so\n   I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the\n   future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not\n   understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes\n   so any observation is welcome.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS\n   media center extender. For more info read this forum: \n  \n_________________________________________________________________________________\n5. WDTV devices are causing so much problems with AAC. I am not sure is this\n   also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you straight link\n   to the discussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized\n   directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each\n   revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264\n   encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source\n   (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://subscene.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://subscene.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please\n   also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two\n   different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct\n   one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly\n   from the source.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e6a128e8c8bde577093cb8102d6be19905a38a","amp;dn":"Cowboys+and+Aliens+Extended+2011+720p+BDRip+QEBS6+AAC20+MP4-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e6a128e8c8bde577093cb8102d6be19905a38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,230,161,40,232,200,189,229,119,9,60,184,16,45,107,225,153,5,163,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
