Sayers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in 2 Parts (02 October 1999) [RadioRip (mp3)]\n\n\nLord Peter Wimsey has fallen in love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ although she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t met him, yet. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the small problem of her incarceration, to begin with. (The object of Lord PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harriet Vane -- is on trial for murdering her lover.)\n\nThe clock is ticking. The case looks absolutely hopeless. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to do something Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but what? And how? Luckily, being a crime novelist, she has a few ideas of her ownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another version of this Dorothy L. Sayers novel on TB, with Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey. And although Carmichael is a wonderful actor and a darling man, I thought youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to hear this version, starring Simon Russell Beale. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit like great music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while different conductors interpret the same work differently, they all help to illuminate the genius of the original.\n\n\nDramatised by Michael Bakewell\n\nSimon Russell Beale as Lord Peter Wimsey\nEmma Fielding as Harriet Vane\nNicholas Boulton as Freddie Arbuthnot\nNicholas Farrell as Chief Inspector Parker\nJennifer Piercy as Miss Climpson\nNevil Jason as Norman Urquhart\nStephen Critchlow as Bunter\nTessa Worsley as Nurse Booth and Mrs Petticam\nDavid Timson as the Judge\n\n\nDirected by Fiona McLean\n\n\nPart 01:\n25.6 MB (26,291 KB / 26,922,657 bytes)\nMPEG-1 Layer 3\n48000Hz 128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo\n\nPart 02:\n26.3 MB (26,976 KB / 27,624,225 bytes)\nMPEG-1 Layer 3\n48000Hz 128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f333d0c31e03fd1380c10917d6073dba3bbf2f","amp;dn":"Strong+Poison+-+Dorothy+L+Sayers+%28BBC+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f333d0c31e03fd1380c10917d6073dba3bbf2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,243,51,208,195,30,3,253,19,128,193,9,23,214,7,61,186,59,191,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
