If you have lost yours, Panasonic is so fucking cheap that they want to sell you the software for 65$ instead of providing it for free as any other peripheral brand would do (d-link, hp, logitech, nameit, they all offer free software download for their devices!)\n\nSo, in order to get revenge on their custommer support, which is totaly closed to any suggestion about how they should consider the replacement software as a free download instead of a \\&quot;replacement part\\&quot;, also they are really slow, it took me 45 minutes to get inline with someone.  That bitch hung up on me when I told her that they had to come in 2007 and start offering the necessary softwares for their products for free.\n\nso here you go panasonic, eat this!  Screw you, you wont get any of my money!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565cb22e2ffcbc433358b1534d390de91af2a4da","amp;dn":"Panasonic+Voice+Editing+Premium+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565cb22e2ffcbc433358b1534d390de91af2a4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,92,178,46,47,252,188,67,51,88,177,83,77,57,13,233,26,242,164,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
