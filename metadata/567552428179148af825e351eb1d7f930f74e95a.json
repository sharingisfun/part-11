The more experienced Basil Dearden offered expert, if unaccredited, advice.\nA scintillating Alastair Sim plays Hawkins, a timid watchmaker with a part time job - he is also a professional assassin who bumps off all the people we love to hate. But when pompous MP Sir Gregory Upshot (Raymond Huntley) is the intended target, bungling vacuum-cleaner salesman William Bloke (George Cole) always gets in the way. As the time of the assassination draws nearer, Hawkins tracks his victim to a dilapidated seaside hotel called The Green Man, and the laughs and tension steadily rise to a brilliant climax.\n\nFeature Running Time: 76 mins Approx Feature Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nFRANK LAUNDER AND SIDNEY GILLIAT PRESENT\nALASTAIR SIM GEORGE COLE TERRY-THOMAS IN THE GREEN MAN&quot;\nALSO STARRING JILL ADAMS WITH RAYMOND HUNTLEY COLIN GORDON AVRIL ANGERS JOHN CHANDOS EILEEN MOORE\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY GERALD GIBBS ART DIRECTION WILFRED SHINGLETON EDITOR BERNARD GRIBBLE SCREENPLAY BY SYDNEY GILLIAT AND FRANK LAUNDER\nFROM THEIR PLAY 'MEET A BODY' MUSIC CONDUCTED BY CEDRIC THORPE DAVIE\nASSOCIATE PROOUCER LESLIE GILLIAT PRODUCED BY FRANK LAUNDER ANO SYDNEY GILLIAT DIRECTED BY ROBERT DAY\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 1956 GRENADIER FILM PRODUCTIONS\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed or I will remove thank you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567552428179148af825e351eb1d7f930f74e95a","amp;dn":"The+Green+Man+%281956+Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567552428179148af825e351eb1d7f930f74e95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,117,82,66,129,121,20,138,248,37,227,81,235,29,127,147,15,116,233,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
