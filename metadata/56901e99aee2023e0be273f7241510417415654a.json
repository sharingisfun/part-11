Sounds like Paul McCartney or The Beatles, but it&amp;#039;s Emitt Rhodes.  Much of his recording was done in his basement in Hawthorne, California.  He sang and played all of the tracks himself, engineered and mixed the albums.\n\nThis album was put out by A&amp;M in 1971.  This rip is from a Russian import CD released in 2006.\n\n\n:::::Emitt Rhodes - The American Dream:::::\n:::::::::::::::: 192 Kbps :::::::::::::::::\n\n1. Mother Earth\n2. Pardon Me\n3.
