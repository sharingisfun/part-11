It was written by Brad Meltzer and Geoff Johns, and illustrated by Ed Benes, Dale Eaglesham, and Shane Davis. It is notable for re-introducing the Legion of Super-Heroes in the post-Infinite Crisis era.\n\nThe JLA has discovered the existence of several members of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the present. With the help of the JSA, Superman and his team must track down all seven Legionnaires to discover why these heroes of the future have traveled back in time!\n\n\nThis crossover would also be the beginning of DC's three year reinvention of the Legion, with the next part occurring in the Action Comics story &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes,&quot; and culminating in Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds.\n\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d9e9cc96be16421073a75ba008f79085790a54","amp;dn":"JLA-JSA+-+The+Lightning+Saga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d9e9cc96be16421073a75ba008f79085790a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,217,233,204,150,190,22,66,16,115,167,91,160,8,247,144,133,121,10,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
