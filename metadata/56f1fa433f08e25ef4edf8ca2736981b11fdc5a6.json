It has been designed to be a source of succinct information for practicing general otolaryngologists, developmental biologist, geneticists and medical students, graduate students and researchers. The book, authored by 23 international otolaryngologist and researchers, is both comprehensive and easy to follow. Each chapter is short, informative and self-contained. It will provide an overview of four main topics related to inner ear development, hearing loss and clinical remedies, and the genetics of deafness in a post-genomic era. \n\nThe overall objective of this book is to bring together noted otolaryngologists and scientists from the perspectives of disciplines complementary to the science of inner ear development and hearing loss, in order to create a thorough review of the current state of knowledge and the available clinical therapies for hearing loss in humans. In the last fifteen years, we have witnessed tremendous progress in understanding the basic biology and genetics of the physiological processes involved in hearing. Many molecular components necessary for the development, function and maintenance of inner ear sensory epithelium have been discovered as a result of identifying the genes for nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of hearing loss in humans and in mice. We know have an unprecedented understanding of the molecular pathways involved in sound transduction, the molecular epidemiology of deafness, and we have reached a new capacity for genetic diagnosis and counseling. With such improvements in clinical practices, the development of novel therapeutic interventions is imminent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f1fa433f08e25ef4edf8ca2736981b11fdc5a6","amp;dn":"Inner+Ear+Development+%26amp%3B+Hearing+Loss+%28Nova%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f1fa433f08e25ef4edf8ca2736981b11fdc5a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,241,250,67,63,8,226,94,244,237,248,202,39,54,152,27,17,253,197,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
