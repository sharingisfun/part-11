Killer jazz lines easy to understand and feel. I'm incredibly inspired to play after hearing just one tune. If you're a gipsy/bebop Jazz guitar lover you gotta get this CD right away (and you can't get it at your local music store either :)&quot;\n\nPersonally I don't feel inspired to play the guitar myself at all after hearing this record. I just sit there in total awe and wouldn't dare to pick up my guitar :) \n\nFull biography at: http://www.jimmyrosenberg.nl/page4EN.html\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork.
