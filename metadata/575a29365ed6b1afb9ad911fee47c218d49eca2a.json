Only Edgers like Rose can easily travel from one world to the next, but they never truly belong in either.\n\nRose thought if she practiced her magic, she could build a better life for herself. But things didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn out how she planned, and now she works a minimum wage, off the books job in the Broken just to survive. Then Declan Camarine, a blueblood noble straight out of the deepest part of the Weird, comes into her life, determined to have her (and her power).\n\nBut when a terrible danger invades the Edge from the Weird, a flood of creatures hungry for magic, Declan and Rose must work together to destroy themÃ¢â‚¬â€or theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll devour the Edge and everyone in it.\n\n\n                            Book 01 - On the Edge\n\n                            Book 02 - Bayou Moon\n\n                            Book 03 - Fate's Edge\n\n                            Book 04 - Steel's Edge\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575a29365ed6b1afb9ad911fee47c218d49eca2a","amp;dn":"The+Edge+Series+by+Ilona+Andrews+%28Books+1+to+4%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575a29365ed6b1afb9ad911fee47c218d49eca2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,90,41,54,94,214,177,175,185,173,145,31,238,71,194,24,212,158,202,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
