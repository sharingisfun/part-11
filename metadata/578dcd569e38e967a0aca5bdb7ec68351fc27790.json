Former music journalists Bob Stanley (born December 25, 1964) and Pete Wiggs (born May 15, 1966) are the other regular members of the band. They are named after the famous French football team AS Saint-ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne, European Cup runners-up in the 1970s.\nSaint Etienne were one of the bands that helped define the indie dance genre in the early 1990s, fusing the production values of the dance-pop that emerged in the wake of the Second Summer of Love with the clever lyrics and self-aware production of indie music. A decade after the band's formation, The Times observed that Saint Etienne &quot;deftly fused the grooviness of Swinging Sixties London with a post-acid house backbeat&quot;[1]. During the 1990s the band also recorded two tracks - &quot;7 Ways to Love&quot; and &quot;He Is Cola&quot; - under the name &quot;Cola Boy&quot; with different singers; their explanation is that the tracks were &quot;too cheesy for Saint Etienne. We'd have been finished overnight&quot;.[1]\nTheir early recordings were packed with generic house music clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, such as standard TR-909 drum patterns and Italo house piano riffs, but they soon found a more original sound notable by the use of found dialogue, mainly from classic '60s British realist cinema as featured on their albums Foxbase Alpha and So Tough. Some of these earlier recordings included skits by satirist Chris Morris.[2] During the early 1990s the group enjoyed extensive coverage in UK music weekly papers NME and Melody Maker and gained a reputation as purveyors of &quot;pure pop&quot; in the period immediately prior to the Brit-Pop explosion. They began to shift towards a more atmospheric type of electronica in 2000 with the release of Sound of Water, dividing their fanbase.\nTheir best-known songs are the cover of Neil Young's classic &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; (on which Moira Lambert provided vocals), &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot; (which was Sarah Cracknell's first contribution as lead singer), &quot;You're in a Bad Way&quot;, and the anthemic &quot;He's on the Phone&quot;. The album Finisterre was released in 2002. A follow-up DVD by photographer and film maker Paul Kelly was released July 4, 2005.\nIn November 2004, they released their first U.S. compilation of greatest hits, called Travel Edition 1990-2005.\nJune 13, 2005, saw the release of the band's new album, entitled Tales from Turnpike House. It was preceded by a single for the track &quot;Side Streets&quot;. A second single, &quot;A Good Thing&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom on October 31, 2005. Early editions of the album were accompanied by a six-track sampler CD for a planned album of children's songs entitled Up the Wooden Hills.\n&quot;A Good Thing&quot; is featured both in Pedro AlmodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³var's award-winning 2006 Spanish film Volver and in the Grey's Anatomy episode titled &quot;Tell Me Sweet Little Lies,&quot; the fourteenth episode of season 2 in 2006.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nGott Nytt ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦r\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578dcd569e38e967a0aca5bdb7ec68351fc27790","amp;dn":"Saint+Etienne-12+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578dcd569e38e967a0aca5bdb7ec68351fc27790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,141,205,86,158,56,233,103,160,172,165,189,183,236,104,53,31,194,119,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
