To circumvent this, however, he focuses on creating a narrative within the music through the combination of synth work and samples. He starts with anything that sparks an interest or emotion in him - Tom Waits, Joni Mitchel, Ella Fitzgerald, Portico Quartet and moments from movies, samples like these usually work as a foundation for the tracks. He then adds layers of unique and organic synth sounds (a notion he finds quite interesting when working entirely from a digital platform) before eventually completing the production with the beat. He likes his music like a nice pie - warm, hearty, and crusty.\n\nArtwork by Felicia Simion.
