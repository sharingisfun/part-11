The 2004 release, like its predecessors, offers a wide variety of styles all embedded under the &quot;gospel&quot; tag. For the more traditional fan, try on the widely popular Blind Boys of Alabama as they &quot;Wade In The Water&quot; or Richard Smallwood with Vision's &quot;My Everything (Praise Waiteth).&quot; More contemporary fans will appreciate Fred Hammond and his driving, upbeat &quot;You Are My Daily Bread,&quot; Hezekiah Walker's hit single &quot;I Need You to Survive&quot; or even the super-slick Kirk Franklin and his roof-raising &quot;Brighter Day.&quot; And for those looking ahead, you'll be encouraged with Tonex's rock-steady &quot;Doesn't Really Matter.&quot; Another nice touch this year is the tribute to Houston, Texas artists (don't miss Kurt Carr's &quot;I Almost Let Go&quot;) as the WOW series features prime gospel markets for the next decade. This is a must-have for any gospel fan or for those curious about where gospel might be going.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, June 2009\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5831a6602cc10af648bb5c669b48645a211a0cab","amp;dn":"WoW+Gospel+-+2004+-+WoW+Gospel+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5831a6602cc10af648bb5c669b48645a211a0cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,49,166,96,44,193,10,246,72,187,92,102,155,72,100,90,33,26,12,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
