Wells he has no idea what trouble lies in store. Because he is about to discover that the apparently respectable establishment now paying his salary is in fact a front for a deeply sinister organisation that has a mighty peculiar agenda. It seems that half the time his bosses are away with the fairies. But they&amp;#039;re not, of course. They&amp;#039;re away with the goblins. Mister Tom Holt, Master of the Comic Fantasy Novel, cordially invites you to join him in his world of madness by reading his next hilarious masterpiece. Dress: informal. RSVP to Orbit Books. Bring a bottle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5836ceeeba264dc0de2fea05175ffb3e0f90f8cb","amp;dn":"Tom+Holt+-+J.+W.+Wells+%26+Co+01+-+The+Portable+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5836ceeeba264dc0de2fea05175ffb3e0f90f8cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,54,206,238,186,38,77,192,222,47,234,5,23,95,251,62,15,144,248,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
