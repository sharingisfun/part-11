Definitely the best role Hunt Powers ever got in Europe and this genre, as he went on to make Django flicks with Fidani, but &quot;Sugar Colt&quot; is memorable also for its unusual script about criminal investigators in the wild west, which makes &quot;Sugar Colt&quot; a comedy in the first half and a serious brutal western in the second half - which is absolutely making sense because the main character is totally changing when he gives up his disguise as doctor Cooper and becomes the gunman Sugar Colt. Composer Luis E Bacalov (&quot;Django&quot;) uses two different themes here to illustrate this: the &quot;Sugar Colt&quot; leitmotif, and the soldiers' theme with the trumpet. Spanish photographer Alejandro Ulloa who also shot Corbucci's &quot;Mercenario&quot; and Castellari's &quot;Ammazzali tutti e torna solo&quot; achieves the perfect western look near Almeria, partly at the same locations &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; was shot at. Together with the skill of director Giraldi (&quot;Seven Guns for the MacGregors&quot;) and the legendary Soledad Miranda in her best western role, this is a must have for a &quot;Western all'italiana&quot; collection even if currently harder to find than many others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58486dff8db26deddf3a51c6409108bfefb31e7c","amp;dn":"Sugar+Colt+%28Spaghetti+Western%29+%5B1967%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58486dff8db26deddf3a51c6409108bfefb31e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,72,109,255,141,178,109,237,223,58,81,198,64,145,8,191,239,179,30,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
