It peaked at number 9 in \nthe UK albums chart and at number 17 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn January 1968, after some initial success in Britain with their debut album Mr. Fantasy, Dave Mason had \ndeparted from the group. He produced the debut album by the group Family, containing in its ranks future \nTraffic bass player Ric Grech, while Traffic went on the road. In May, the band had invited Mason back to \nbegin recording the new album.\n\nMason ended up writing and singing half of the songs on the album \n(including his biggest hit &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;) but making scant contribution to the songs written by Jim \nCapaldi and Steve Winwood. His flair for pop melody had always been at odds with the others' jazz ambitions\nevidenced by the dichotomy seen for the songs on this album, and by October he was again out of the band. \nHe would return one more time for a tour and album in 1971 to run out the band's contract.\n\n\n   1.
