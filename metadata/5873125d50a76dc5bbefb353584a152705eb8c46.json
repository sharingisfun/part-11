This unit answers these and many other questions about the Jew who divided history.\n\nDVD Three - Anti-Semitism\n\nIf it is true that the Jewish people are the chosen of God, then it is equally true that they have had to endure incredible suffering precisely because of that unique relationship, and never more so than in the European Holocaust. This unit examines the origins and roots of anti-Semitism, this evil plagueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s negative impact on Jewish life in every culture and in virtually every generation.\n\nDVD Four - Aliyah, Rebirth of A Nation\n\nCan a nation be born in a day? This unit both asks and answers this profound question by tracing the history of the Jewish children of Abraham from the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70, through 20 centuries of exile among the nations, up and until their miraculous return to their ancient and biblical homeland, Israel.\n\nDVD Five - Israel in Crisis\n\nSince her rebirth in 1948, Israel has struggled to survive as a Jewish homeland in a hostile neighborhood, a democracy surrounded by nations governed by dictators. Wars and rumors of wars have been the daily diet Israelis have had to swallow for more than 60 years. And between the wars the incessant threat of terror attacks, when suicide bombers stalk the streets, and when every bus or gathering place is a target and maximum collateral damage the goal. Yet, somehow Israel has continued to survive and thrive.\n\nDVD Six - What Time Is It?\n\nArmageddon: the mother of all battles. How do we explain the fact that one of the smallest nations on earth, both in terms of population and land area, is headline news every day? And why has Jerusalem, a city virtually ignored for 2000 years, suddenly become the focus of the nations? This final unit in the series examines current events and climate changes in light of biblical prophecies, specifically showing how Israel and Jerusalem fit into this end time scenario, and how there is a prophetic continuum from Abraham to Armageddon.\n\n&quot;My wife and I just viewed Israel A Journey Through Time in its entirety, in one sitting!  It was that captivating and informative and factual. It's urgent, we believe, that all Christians come to a deeper understanding of our Jewish roots and heritage and our link to the destiny of Israel. This film is a graduate course in these things.&quot; - Pat Boone\n\n\n\nOther Christmas Specials\n\n\n\nChristmas Special - Jesus of Nazareth - DVD &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11618182/Christmas_Special_-_Jesus_of_Nazareth_-_DVD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11618182/Christmas_Special_-_Jesus_of_Nazareth_-_DVD&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - The Star of Bethlehem &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11611654/Christmas_Special_-_The_Star_of_Bethlehem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11611654/Christmas_Special_-_The_Star_of_Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - WoW Gospel - 1996 thru 2015 - 20 yrs of Christ in Music &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11620224/Christmas_Special_-_WoW_Gospel_-_1996_thru_2015_-_20_yrs_of_Chri&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11620224/Christmas_Special_-_WoW_Gospel_-_1996_thru_2015_-_20_yrs_of_Chri&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - Origins - What Christmas Is Really About - It ain't Santa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11627909/Christmas_Special_-_Origins_-_What_Christmas_Is_Really_About_-_I#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11627909/Christmas_Special_-_Origins_-_What_Christmas_Is_Really_About_-_I#&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - The Holy Bible - Audio - KJV - Alexander Scourby the Voice of The Bible &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11633397/Christmas_Special_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Audio_-_KJV_-_Alexander_Sco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11633397/Christmas_Special_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Audio_-_KJV_-_Alexander_Sco&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChristmas Special - Veggie Tales - Cartoons For Kids &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyhub.com/details_resource.php?it=12170&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyhub.com/details_resource.php?it=12170&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
