Eventually, after \n   years of tyranny and chaos, the good armies of the nearby lands,\n   headed by the infamous Circle of Eight descended into the temple and   \n   razed it,    imprisoning the villains inside. For years thereafter relative\n   peace    ensued, as daring adventurers slew the remaining monsters \n   that ravaged the    land above and the temple itself faded into but a \n   distant memory...until \n   now\n   \n   Bandits have begun to patrol the roads outside Hommlet and Nulb again. \n   Wicked forces are rumored to be afoot, converging on the ruined temple \n   for malevolent purposes. Who and what these men are, no one can be \n   sure. All claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and  \n   security to Hommlet; but deeds speak more loudly than words, and lies \n   cloak the true purposes of the malevolent. \n   \n   So begins the classic Gygax D&amp;amp;D module, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Temple of Elemental EvilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, \n   brought to the PC for the first time with 3.5 Edition rules by Troika \n   Games.
