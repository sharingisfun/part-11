It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. The game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.\n\nAs in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.\t\n\nSystem Requirements:\n====================\n\nMinimum: 1.7 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM, DirectX 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE), Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nRecommended: Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better), 1GB RAM, DirectX 9 level Graphics Card, Windows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nMultilanguage Support:\n======================\n\nBrazilian  (GUI Only)\nBulgarian  (GUI Only)\nCzech  (GUI Only)\nDanish  (GUI Only)\nDutch  (GUI Only)\nEnglish  (GUI and Radio)\nFinnish  (GUI Only)\nFrench  (GUI and Radio)\nGerman  (GUI and Radio)\nGreek  (GUI Only)\nHungarian  (GUI Only)\nItalian  (GUI and Radio)\nJapanese  (GUI Only)\nKorean  (GUI Only)\nNorwegian  (GUI Only)\nPolish  (GUI Only)\nPortugeuse  (GUI Only)\nRomanian  (GUI Only)\nRussian  (GUI Only)\nSpanish  (GUI and Radio)\nSwedish  (GUI Only)\nChinese_simp  (GUI Only)\nChinese_trad  (GUI Only)\nThai  (GUI Only)\nTurkish  (GUI Only)\n\nLanguage choosing in installation process !!!\n\nInstallation:\n=============\n\nTo install game use: Setup.exe\nAfter install run Updater.\nChange nick use in game-console: setname &quot;your name&quot;\n\n\nUpdate Game Support:\n====================\n\nIf you need udpating game run: Css_Updater.exe ... few minutes ... and thats all - complete :)\n\nCurrent Version:\n================\n\nProtocol version 24\nExe version 1807769 (cstrike)\nExe build: 19:53:34 Jun 18 2013 (5337) (240)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588bbd115edc30a8485af3fb45e170e2be80a301","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike+Source+v1807769+Full+%2BAutoUpdate+%2BMultilanguage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588bbd115edc30a8485af3fb45e170e2be80a301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,139,189,17,94,220,48,168,72,90,243,251,69,225,112,226,190,128,163,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
