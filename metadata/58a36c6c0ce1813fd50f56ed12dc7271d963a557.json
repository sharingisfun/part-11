His debut album transformed him from the frontman of Genesis to a solo star who happened to be in Genesis, too. Contains &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;I Missed Again.&quot;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - In the Air Tonight [5:36]\n02 - This Must Be Love [3:56]\n03 - Behind the Lines [3:53]\n04 - The Roof Is Leaking [3:18]\n05 - Droned [2:50]\n06 - Hand in Hand [5:23]\n07 - I Missed Again [3:46]\n08 - You Know What I Mean [2:33]\n09 - Thunder and Lightning [4:13]\n10 - I&amp;#039;m Not Moving [2:35]\n11 - If Leaving Me Is Easy [4:55]\n12 - Tomorrow Never Knows [4:47]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a36c6c0ce1813fd50f56ed12dc7271d963a557","amp;dn":"Phil+Collins+-+Face+Value+%281981%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a36c6c0ce1813fd50f56ed12dc7271d963a557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,163,108,108,12,225,129,63,213,15,86,237,18,220,114,113,217,99,165,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
