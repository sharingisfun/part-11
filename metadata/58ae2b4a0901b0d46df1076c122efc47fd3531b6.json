But few of these nicknames fully encompass the majesty of his voice, the influence he had on the artists of his generation, or the legacy his music has left behind. He was idolized by Elvis Presley, emulated by Jackie Wilson and Brook Benton, and covered by the Righteous Brothers. And his voice and legacy have earned him a place in the annals of history for years to come.\n\nDuring his career, Roy spawned over 50 singles, eight of which crossed over to the pop charts. His bevy of hits included the aforementioned Ã¢â‚¬Å“WalkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, released in 1954, which went to number one on the R&amp;B chart and was a pop hit, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unchained MelodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, another number one R&amp;B hit as well as a top ten pop hit the following year, and the up-tempo hits Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1958 and Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Can Have HerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in 1961, both top ten hits. He also berthed a great deal of minor hits, such as his version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ebb TideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HurtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Loved YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forgive This FoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Without a SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He rigorously toured and performed all over the world, his rich voice and prolific repertoire fitting in at the supper-clubs and cocktail lounges just as easily as on the ChitlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Circuit. His bona fide status as a Rock and Roll, star, however, got him a featured spot in the 1958 Columbia Pictures movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nthis was released in 2013 (probably as compilation) and orginaly contained 16 songs, but I have added 2 more.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
