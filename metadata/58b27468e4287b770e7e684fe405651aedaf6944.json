It was also the last album to include bassist John Entwistle and drummer Kenney Jones, and reached #11 in the UK and #8 in the US upon its release.\n\n\n Driven by Pete Townshend's arching musical ambitions, It's Hard was an undistinguished final effort from the Who. Featuring layers of synthesizers and long-winded, twisting song structures, the album featured few memorable melodies and little energy, with only the anthemic &quot;Athena&quot; and the terse &quot;Eminence Front&quot; making a lasting impression.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Athena\n 02 - It's Your Turn\n 03 - Cooks Country\n 04 - It's Hard\n 05 - Dangerous\n 06 - Eminence Front\n 07 - I've Known No War\n 08 - One Life's Enough\n 09 - One At A Time\n 10 - Why Did I Fall For That\n 11 - A Man Is A Man\n 12 - Cry If You Want\n 13 - It's Hard (Live)\n 14 - Eminence Front (Live)\n 15 - Dangerous (Live)\n 16 - Cry If You Want (Live)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58b27468e4287b770e7e684fe405651aedaf6944","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+It%27s+Hard+%281982%2F2015%29+24-bit%2F96+kHz+HDTracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58b27468e4287b770e7e684fe405651aedaf6944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,178,116,104,228,40,123,119,14,126,104,79,228,5,101,26,237,175,105,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
