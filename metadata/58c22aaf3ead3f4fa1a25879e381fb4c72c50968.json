In between were a live album, a greatest hits package as well as the four solo outings. With Ã¢â‚¬ËœDynasty,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the kings of theatrical rock show a maturation in its music as the emphasis is on the song and melody lines instead of bombastic guitar riffs and relentless mayhem. The single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Was Made For LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ You,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ has a subtle disco beat, while the other tracks are mainstream rockers paced by the interplay of bassist Gene Simmons, guitarist Paul Stanley, drummer Peter Criss and lead guitarist Ace FrehleyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Billboard, 6/9/79). There is a certain amount of honesty in that review.\nDynasty certainly took the band where they had never been before with what would become only their second Gold-certified single, in the form of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Was Made For LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was released in May 1979. It is interesting to note that the single did not even manage to go top 10 in the US, only reaching #11 with 16 weeks on the charts. The singleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success was greater outside of America, where in many markets it reached #1 or #2. Paul was happy enough to stay positive about the song and its roots, stating, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a huge success. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the biggest selling single weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had in the world to date and I thought with everything going on with dancing and with disco. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that doing a full ahead disco beat would be bad if it was a good song. You know some of the early Motown stuff, The Four Tops kind of thing, those were basically the same kind of beat. I think if the music is good it really doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter what kind it is, I think that bad heavy metal music is as bad as bad disco. Bad music is bad music, if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all that mattersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3XY).\n\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and seed :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c22aaf3ead3f4fa1a25879e381fb4c72c50968","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Dynasty+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c22aaf3ead3f4fa1a25879e381fb4c72c50968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,194,42,175,62,173,63,79,161,162,88,121,227,129,251,76,114,197,9,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
