Detractors always felt that the band was the commercialization of other similar groups such as Garbage, yet Republica's music has a definite pop leaning that sets them apart from some of their contemporaries. Since Republica is more or less a studio creation -- more about &quot;production&quot; than being a band, really -- it's not surprising that the project employed a team of all-star producers including Alan Winstanley and the Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudie. What resulted was a cycle of ten tracks in an album far more diverse than their debut. While the disco-metal that ruled their first record has been pushed to the back of the mix here -- only some of the songs actually have the same pounding rhythms on the debut -- the songwriting has come exceptionally far. It's especially noticeable on the excellent single &quot;Try Anything,&quot; a moving power-ballad that's also awash in beats. Other highlights include the hard-driving &quot;From Rush Hour With Love&quot; and the spacey &quot;Fading of the Man.&quot;.
