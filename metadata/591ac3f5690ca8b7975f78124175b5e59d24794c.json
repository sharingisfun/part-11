The new edition has been revised to be fully in line with the new Vocational GCSE in Manufacturing from Edexcel, covering the three compulsory units of this scheme, and will continue to act as a core text for Intermediate GNVQ. Coverage of the two schemes is combined throughout the text, yet each chapter clearly illustrates which sections map to which units within the two scheme specifications.\n\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 320 pages\nPublisher: Newnes; 3 edition (June 16, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0750659904\nISBN-13: 978-0750659901","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591ac3f5690ca8b7975f78124175b5e59d24794c","amp;dn":"Basic+Manufacturing%2C+Third+Edition+by+Roger+Timings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591ac3f5690ca8b7975f78124175b5e59d24794c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,26,195,245,105,12,168,183,151,95,120,18,65,117,181,229,157,36,121,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
