Follow the epic, unforgettable story of the Kickboxing Academy kids as they go head-to-head against the menacing Fatal Combat.\n\nTarbeck, the shell-shocked owner of Fatal Combat, will stop at nothing to gain control of the Kickboxing Academy. The stakes are raised when the schools face off in a winner-take-all tournament whose outcome will change the lives of all involved forever. After the Kickboxing Academy students experience robbery, vandalism, attempted murder, and attempted rape, will they back down, or will they win the day and become victorious? \n\nMatt Davis gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Stan, the misunderstood protagonist with a troubled past and something to prove. Supported by an all-star cast, his performance lights up the screen and leaves the audience wanting more. Oscar-worthy cinematography and soundtrack complete Kickboxing Academy experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592cb5547d289471965760744fe43131ef3f5e72","amp;dn":"Kickboxing+Academy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592cb5547d289471965760744fe43131ef3f5e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,44,181,84,125,40,148,113,150,87,96,116,79,228,49,49,239,63,94,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
