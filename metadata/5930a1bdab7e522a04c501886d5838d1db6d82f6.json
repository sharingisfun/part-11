He meets with an amount of local hostility, while his life is at risk from those on the fascist side. Support comes from an unlikely if attractive quarter.

It is from a story by Graham Greene who wrote &quot;The Third Man.&quot;  There is also a radio play available on fileshare of the radio adaptation of Confidential Agent.\n\n   This is an espionage story set during the time of the Spanish Civil war against Fascism in the late 30's.  But there are clear references to the war just ended in 1945.\nThe performances and story are very strong.  There is a plea for mercy scene as compelling as the one in &quot;Miller's Crossing.&quot;  Late in the film you will see the revenge sought on the murder of a child.  That confrontation moment alone makes the film worthwhile.\n\n   Please consider adding this to your permanent torrent share.\n\n\n\nNotes written July 7th, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5930a1bdab7e522a04c501886d5838d1db6d82f6","amp;dn":"Confidential+Agent+%281945%29+starring+Charles+Boyer+and+Lauren+Baca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5930a1bdab7e522a04c501886d5838d1db6d82f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,48,161,189,171,126,82,42,4,197,1,136,109,88,56,209,219,109,130,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
