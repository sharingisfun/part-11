Each is a complete game in itself, including character creation and advancement rules--thus the OGL, not d20, designation.\n\nThe books are:\nOGL Ancients (Mythic Greece and Egypt)\nOGL Cybernet (Cyberpunk)\nOGL Horror\nOGL Steampunk\n\nEach is meant to be highly flexible--you can use OGL Ancients to play a strictly historical game or a mythological game, OGL Steampunk to play one set in an imaginary world or in an alternate Victorian earth, with or without fantasy elements.\n\nThere is also an OGL Wild West, which I do not have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593b43ae216c0a4c5e9f3f5bb0da457c971c5c49","amp;dn":"Mongoose+Publishing+OGL+%28d20%29+Genre+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593b43ae216c0a4c5e9f3f5bb0da457c971c5c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,59,67,174,33,108,10,76,94,159,63,91,176,218,69,124,151,28,92,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
