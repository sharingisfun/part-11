From a nude Reiko Ike massacring an entire yakuza gang in a snowy courtyard, to the confrontation with a group of switchblade-wielding nuns on a moving train, director Norifumi Suzuki delivered the goods ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and created a pop trash tour-de-force in the process. Throw in psychedelic sets and colors, and a dolled-up Christina Lindberg, and youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve got a film that no fan of Japanese exploitation should pass up.\n\nSex and Fury is the female yakuza period piece, taken to the next illogical level. In 1968, actress Junko Fuji had moved into traditionally male territory by starring in the Red Peony Gambler series. Red Peony Gambler created a feminine alternative to the archetypal wandering yakuza loner perhaps best embodied by Shintaro Katsu in his Zatoichi and Wicked Priest roles. Between 1972 and 1974, Meiko Kaji starred in the Female Convict Scorpion and Lady Snowblood films, baroque, violent and sexy exploitation masterpieces. Sex and Fury was ToeiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s response to, and escalation of, this trend. Facing devastating competition from television, Toei did the only thing it thought it could - cram its movies with enough sex and violence to choke a horse in a desperate attempt to put asses on the seats. The resulting Pinky Violence and Roman Porno genres are a mixed bag, both morally and aesthetically, but the positive elements in Sex and Fury far outweigh the negative.\n\nSex and Fury is a cross between the period-piece revenge plot of Lady Snowblood and the lurid sexuality and over-the-top artiness of the first two Female Convict Scorpion movies (which I highly recommend). Director Norifumi Suzuki (School of the Holy Beast, ShogunÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Ninja) took the best of both worlds, and added in the parallel plotting of a Zatoichi film. The film moves at a crackling pace, and entertains from start to finish.\n\nSuzuki makes the visuals the third star, staging the actions in ways that would make the better-known Seijun Suzuki proud. The pulsating torture disco, blasphemous S&amp;M torture session in front of a cubist Jesus, and a whirling assault on a Mondrian-inspired tatami mat floor, among other stand-out scenes should satisfy any viewerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s appetite for eye candy. (IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½m happy to note that in the last year, several of SuzukiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s previously AWOL films have become available on Region 1 DVD.)\n\nSex and Fury kicks off with the assassination of a detective by nameless thugs. His last act is to give his daughter, the only witness, a clue to the identity of his killers ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ three hanafuda cards, the deer, the boar, and the butterfly. Flash forward 20 years to 1905, and the daughter is now the gorgeous and deadly Reiko Ike, who takes a new name, Inoshika Ocho, from her quarry (ino = boar, shika = deer, ocho = butterfly). Meanwhile, gang boss and political fixer Kurokawa (Seizaburo Kawazu) and his flunky Iwakura (Hiroshi Nawa) consolidate the power of their Seishinkai Group, carving out territory in an increasingly confident and modernized Japan.\n\nOcho, now a renowned gambler and thief, butts heads with the Seishinkai after a dying yakuza gambler asks her to help his sister, the object of IwakuraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s lust (the death scene lead to my favorite line in the film: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Hell waits right beneath the gambling matÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½). Two other individuals also cross OchoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s path. The first is Shunosuke (Masataka Naruse), the dashing son of a murdered rival of the Seishinkai, sporting manga-hair and a mile-wide grudge against Kurokawa. The second is Christina (Christina Lindberg), a mysterious westerner, talented both with a gun and at the gambling table. And, unsurprisingly, events ultimately tie into the unresolved slaying of OchoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s father.\n\nReiko Ike (StreetfighterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Last Revenge, Battles without Honor and Humanity) is no Meiko Kaji, but sheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s the next best thing (still nowhere near ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Meiko Kaji is untouchable). Ike has striking features, a great figure, and throws herself into her role with gusto. The highlight is unquestionably the lengthy fight sequence when Ocho is surprised by attackers in the bath, and proceeds to slaughter wave after wave of knife-wielding yakuza in the nude. The fight scene is creative and well choreographed, with Ike battling furiously in the snow. One extended shot of only feet, shadows, and falling limbs is particularly impressive. Only the incredible nude battle in 1970ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Zatoichi and the Fire Festival is its equal, though to more comic effect.\n\nSwedish star Christina Lindberg (Thriller aka They Call Her One Eye) makes the most of her part, considering her limited range and the necessity of performing in awkward phonetic English and Japanese. Whatever problems her presence creates are more than compensated for by her enjoyably melodramatic storyline, Cinderella outfits, and a very sexy scene late in the film.\n\nThe only nits I have to pick are the expected ones. Films from Japan and Hong Kong have a repugnant habit of staging sexual assaults for the purpose of titillation, and Sex and Fury is no exception. Also, there is an extended S&amp;M scene that lacks appeal for non-enthusiasts. Fortunately, the foregoing scenes form only a small part of the goings-on, and not nearly enough to ruin oneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s enjoyment of the film. Of course, it goes without saying that Sex and Fury is not for everyone. The only other minor issue is that the score is not as good as one expects from films of this period ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ it ranges between lounge piano and jam band, and evokes both Barbarella and Jimi Hendrix, but frequently undercuts the action on screen. \n\nOverall, Sex and Fury is a superior bit of entertainment. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a great example of its time and genre. For those interested in more films on a similar wavelength, Sex and Fury is not quite up to the level of the first Lady Snowblood, the first two Female Convict Scorpion films, or the first three Lone Wolf &amp; Cub films, but is superior to the later entries in all three of those series, as well as to the Hanzo the Razor trilogy. Sex and Fury is followed by its sequel, Female Yakuza Tale, also released by Panik House, which I have reviewed here.\n\nRecommended? Yes, but not for the squeamish. This is a sex and violence classic.\n\nIf you like this, you might like: Female Convict Scorpion 1 and 2, Zatoichi and the Festival of Fire, Lady Snowblood 1, Hanzo the Razor 2, Lone Wolf and Cub 1-3, The Streetfighter, The Sexy Killer, Coffy, Kiss of Death (Shaw Bros.)\n\nReview By: David Austin\n\nSource: http://www.cinemastrikesback.com/index.php?p=645\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5969a06bc2237d2cf7ef3fc01375357c52915a6a","amp;dn":"Sex+and+Fury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5969a06bc2237d2cf7ef3fc01375357c52915a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,105,160,107,194,35,125,44,247,239,63,192,19,117,53,124,82,145,90,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
