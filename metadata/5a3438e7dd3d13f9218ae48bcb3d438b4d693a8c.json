This glimpse into the brilliant pianist at different eras and in differing contexts stands as a piece of vital Cuban jazz. Opening with &quot;Irakere,&quot; a song that pointed to the group that Chucho Valdes would co-found with Arturo Sandoval and Paquito DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Rivera the following year, Valdes is simply brilliant. \n\nThe first five of the 10 performances presented here were recorded in 1972 on an album entitled &quot;Jazz BatÃƒÂ¡.&quot; All are extraordinary. He is percussive on &quot;Son No. 2&quot; and harmonic while bordering on outside on the brilliant &quot;Neurosis.&quot; The solo piano on both &quot;Laureen&quot; and &quot;Palia&quot; are lush and emotive, at times reminding of Bill Evans, though perhaps more exploratory and adventurous.\n\nThe second set of recordings, from 1982, reflect the post-Irakere Valdes who had realized his dream of leading an adventurous and critically acclaimed large ensemble. This quintet date was originally released as &quot;Tema de Chaka.&quot; The title piece from these sessions features the fiery tenor of German Velazco and ValdesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ explosive chill-generating pianistics. All are underlined by a busy rhythm section that threatens to run away with the tune.\n\nChucho Valdes is simply one of the most important and dynamic musicians to emerge from Cuba ever.\n\n\nChucho ValdÃƒÂ©s\n\nJazz BatÃƒÂ¡ \n\n2007\n\n \n  CD / 2007 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
