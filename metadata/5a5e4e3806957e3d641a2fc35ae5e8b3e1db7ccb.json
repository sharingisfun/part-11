In some ways, she's the opposite of Grimes, who sprinkles just enough sugar over her quirky musical ideas to make them accessible. Instead, Charli XCX's songs are pop with a capital P -- she's unabashed in her love for Britney and Mariah -- but just odd enough to be unique. Like Quentin Tarantino, to whom True Romance's title pays homage, she has a flair for combining a wide array of pop culture sources into something fresh and familiar, as well as a fondness for strong female characters. These songs are filled with tough girls in varying stages of love, most strikingly on the equally vindictive and catchy &quot;You (Ha Ha Ha),&quot; which punctuates its heartbreak with bitter laughter. While Charli's rapping won't threaten many MCs, her laid-back delivery is reminiscent of Uffie as well as late-'80s and early-'90s pop, particularly the charmingly awkward &quot;flow&quot; of the Spice Girls, whom she counts as a major influence. Elsewhere, she smooths some of the edges of her previous work -- not that True Romance's pop isn't engagingly strange, and strangely engaging. Inventive productions are as vital to her music as her bold persona; she's worked with LindstrÃƒÂ¸m, Balam Acab, Jezus Million, and other innovative producers, and tracks like the dreamy, R&amp;B-tinged &quot;So Far Away&quot; help her blur her influences into something she can call her own. Her songs could easily be all surface and attitude, but there's also a genuine emotional pull to them: the excellent ode to romantic familiarity &quot;What I Like&quot; is peppered with enough details to sound as cozy as a boyfriend's sweater feels. Previously released songs like &quot;Nuclear Seasons&quot; and &quot;Stay Away&quot; remain highlights, but new songs like &quot;Black Roses&quot; -- one of the best blends of really-real feelings and unashamedly artificial sounds here -- show that Charli didn't give away all of her tricks and treats on her EPs. Since quite a few of these songs were already road-tested, it's not surprising that this is a strong debut, but just how consistently catchy and personal True Romance is might raise a few eyebrows.\nAll Music Review by Heather Phares\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Nuclear Seasons\n[02] You\n[03] Take My Hand\n[04] Stay Away\n[05] Set Me Free\n[06] Grins\n[07] So Far Away\n[08] Cloud Aura - - - Charli XCX Featuring Brooke Candy\n[09] What I Like\n[10] Black Roses\n[11] You're The One\n[12] How Can I\n[13] Lock You Up\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:45m:59s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 116mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
