Get It Wrong Get It Right\n\n  With Metals, Feist responds to the surprise success of 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s The Reminder with a whisper, not a bang. She treads lightly through a series of disjointed torch songs and smoky pop/rock numbers, singing most of the songs in a soft, gauzy alto, as though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid of waking some sort of slumbering beast. Whenever the tempo picks up, so does FeistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desire to keep things weird, with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“A CommotionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ pitting pizzicato strings against a half-chanted, half-shouted refrain performed by an army of male singers. But Metals does its best work at a slower speed, where Feist can stretch her vocals across fingerplucked guitar arpeggios and piano chords like cotton. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cicadas and Gulls,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its simple melodies and pastoral ambience, rides the same summer breeze as Iron &amp; Wine, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anti-PioneerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ breaks down the blues into its sparsest parts, retaining little more than a sparse drumbeat and guitar until the second half, where strings briefly swoon into the picture like an Ennio Morricone movie soundtrack. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gone after 30 seconds, though, leaving things as quiet as they began. Like the rest of the subdued track list, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anti-PioneerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is unlikely to find itself featured in an iPod commercial, meaning FeistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s days as a provider of hip, trendy TV jingles may be over. Still, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a soft-spoken power to Metals, even if its songs are more liquid and atmospheric than the title suggests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a627e33b9b1d835241dc811f98a762c1170dabb","amp;dn":"Feist+-+Metals+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a627e33b9b1d835241dc811f98a762c1170dabb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,98,126,51,185,177,216,53,36,29,200,17,249,138,118,44,17,112,218,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
