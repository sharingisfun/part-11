Her novellas and short stories contain all the elements fans have come to love from the Raksura books: courtly intrigue and politics, unfolding mysteries that reveal an increasingly strange wider world, and threats both mundane and magical.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Dead City&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ is a tale of Moon before he came to the Indigo Court. As Moon is fleeing the ruins of Saraseil, a groundling city destroyed by the Fell, he flies right into another potential disaster when a friendly caravanserai finds itself under attack by a strange force. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Dark Earth Below,&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ Moon and Jade face their biggest adventure yet; their first clutch. But even as Moon tries to prepare for impending fatherhood, members of the Kek village in the colony tree's roots go missing, and searching for them only leads to more mysteries as the court is stalked by an unknown enemy.\n\nStories of Moon and the shape changers of Raksura have delighted readers for years. This world is a dangerous place full of strange mysteries, where the future can never be taken for granted and must always be fought for with wits and ingenuity, and often tooth and claw. With these two new novellas, Martha Wells shows that the world of the Raksura has many more stories to tellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac149b7b33c4d424872c9e2b31926ee57af50bf","amp;dn":"Martha+Wells+-+Stories+of+the+Raksura+Vol.l","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac149b7b33c4d424872c9e2b31926ee57af50bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,193,73,183,179,60,77,66,72,114,201,226,179,25,38,238,87,175,80,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
