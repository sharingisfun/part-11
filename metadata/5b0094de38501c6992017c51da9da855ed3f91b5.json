Especially in large prints hung on a wall, the difference between Blow Up and Photoshop is astounding. Version 3 makes pictures even sharper without computer artifacts.\r\n\r\nIf you understand Photoshopâ€™s resize command then you already know how to use Blow Up. Our large library of standard paper sizes makes it even easier. With Lightroom and CMYK support, Blow Up fits into a professional workflow.\r\n\r\nImage Quality\r\nIn Blow Up 3 we found ways to make edges even sharper without introducing computery artifacts. The images below show the difference between Blow Up 3 and the traditional bicubic photo resizer used by Photoshop and other image editors.\r\n\r\nSimplicity\r\nBlow Upâ€™s interface is deceptively simple. Just set your paper size as you would in Photoshop and optionally set a crop region. In version 3 we kept all the rocket science under the hood. \r\n\r\nLightroom Support\r\nBlow Up 3 has tight Lightroom integration that supports batch processing and does not require Photoshop.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.alienskin.com/blowup/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b0094de38501c6992017c51da9da855ed3f91b5","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Blow+Up+3.1.0.128+Revision+33753","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b0094de38501c6992017c51da9da855ed3f91b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,0,148,222,56,80,28,105,146,1,124,81,218,157,168,85,237,63,145,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
