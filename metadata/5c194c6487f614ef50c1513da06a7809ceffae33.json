His operas are produced more than any other composer's, and one (admittedly unverifiable) source claims that his La traviata (1853) has been staged live somewhere around the world every evening for the past 100 years.\n\nWhat are the treasures of creativity that account for this popularity? With Professor Robert Greenberg, you unpack them in depth and detail in this 32-lecture series.\n\nYou explore both famous and not-so-famous Verdi operas, as well as his Requiem Mass of 1874, his one great concert work; his early songs; and his very last composition, the Stabat Mater.\n\nYou trace his development from a more or less conventional composer of operas in the traditional Italian bel canto (''beautifully sung'') style to a creator of truly innovative musical dramas in which the power of music to intensify and explore human emotion is exploited to the fullest degree.\n\n''Verdi was a great dramatist and a great melodist at the same time, whose artistic evolution never ceased across the 50-year span of his career,'' says Professor Greenberg.\n\n\n32 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c194c6487f614ef50c1513da06a7809ceffae33","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Life+and+Operas+of+Verdi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c194c6487f614ef50c1513da06a7809ceffae33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,25,76,100,135,246,20,239,80,193,81,61,160,106,120,9,206,255,174,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
