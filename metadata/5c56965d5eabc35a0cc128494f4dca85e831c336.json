It can greatly enhance the quality of your modelling output, whether applying a full livery scheme or simply blending in areas of new paintwork. A good airbrush will offer unparalleled levels of finish and consistency, as well as the chance to create unique effects such as weathering and stencilling. This book reveals how anyone can use an airbrush effectively, provided that a few basic rules are followed. All of the necessary techniques are described, along with a wealth of practical guidance and detailed advice on choosing a spraying set-up to match your own needs and budget. Covers cleaning and maintaining the airbrush, 'tricks of the trade' and techniques suitable for a range of subjects, across each of the popular scales.\n\n\nBy George Dent\nPublished by The Crowood Press in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c56965d5eabc35a0cc128494f4dca85e831c336","amp;dn":"+Airbrushing+for+Railway+Modellers+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c56965d5eabc35a0cc128494f4dca85e831c336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,86,150,93,94,171,195,90,12,193,40,73,79,77,202,133,232,49,195,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
