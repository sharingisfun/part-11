I have both a styled Signs &amp; Songs only track and full styled subs track that I made from the Rising-Sun release (with the latest fixes).\n\nThe only weird thing was that for episodes 20 and 21, the US BD release skipped the recap after the OP for some reason so I used audio from a4e's DVD encode for those two (the volume may be a bit louder as well). If you know how to fix this, let me know.\n\nI've checked all the episodes for the most part but if I missed anything, give me a shout out. I also included the Rising-Sun full subs and Signs &amp; Songs only subs that I made and used. I'll probably upload MEGA links to Kametsu in the future. And as always, please SEED.\n\nVideo: 1440x1080 8-bit (Rising-Sun JP-BD)\nJP Audio: 2.0 16-bit FLAC (Rising-Sun JP-BD)\nEN Audio: 2.0 AC3 (DHD US-BD) except for episodes 20 &amp; 21 (a4e US-DVD)\nSigns &amp; Songs; Full English Subs: Rising-Sun (and deanzel edit)\nChaptered\n\n[deanzel] Nadia - Secret of Blue Water [BD 1080p Dual Audio AC3-FLAC]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.kametsu.com/index.php?/forum/57-dual-audio/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.kametsu.com/index.php?/forum/57-dual-audio/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c64cf9030811fc89d34df1eb6a1b87298430855","amp;dn":"%5Bdeanzel%5D+Nadia+-+Secret+of+Blue+Water+%5BBD+1080p+Dual+Audio+AC3-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c64cf9030811fc89d34df1eb6a1b87298430855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,100,207,144,48,129,31,200,157,52,223,30,182,161,184,114,152,67,8,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
