For root users, lists all installed apps which have local internal databases. You can then select an app and edit any of its databases.\n\nFully integrated with Root Explorer. When browsing files in Root Explorer, selecting a database file automatically launches this app instead of the database viewer that is built into Root Explorer.\n\nNon-root users can browse and edit databases on the SD card.\n\nData is displayed in a smooth scrollable grid and records can be filtered on any field value.\n\nWhat's in this version:\nv2.0.1\nFixed the start-up FC on some devices. Sorry! Thanks to Ben, Shawn and Victor for your help.\nv2.0\nChanged the main screen to use swipe-able tabs.\nAdded Bookmarks and Recent tabs for quick access to regularly accessed databases.\nCan now quickly sort records by clicking on a column header.\nAdded action bar icons for Honeycomb, ICS and JellyBean devices.\nImproved stability when returning to the app during multi-tasking.\nFixed lock-ups when selecting apps containing lots of local files.\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c81e69cd0bcd89f0a67936c968a5b89ea259614","amp;dn":"SQLite+Editor+v2.0.1+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c81e69cd0bcd89f0a67936c968a5b89ea259614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,129,230,156,208,188,216,159,10,103,147,108,150,138,91,137,234,37,150,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
