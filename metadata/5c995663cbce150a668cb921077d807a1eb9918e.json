Clad in vintage black suits, narrow ties, fedoras, and omnipresent wrap-around sunglasses, the Blues Brothers delivered spirited renditions of classic soul hits in the tradition of the signature Stax-Volt sound; purists may still cringe, but if nothing else the group deserves credit for introducing any number of soul and blues classics to a new generation of listeners while also allowing some of the most gifted session men in the business a chance to shine on-stage and -screen. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tEast West\nCatalog:\t\t7567 80620-2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n02.Gimme Some Lovin'\n03.Think (Feat.
