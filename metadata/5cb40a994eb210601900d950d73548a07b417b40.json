At a time when dance groups and techno were basically clones of one another (with some exceptions, of course), The KLF managed to make tunes that were both accepted for radio play and still original. This album is full of up-tempo dance beats on the A side, which fulfill all your groove-a-licious needs; the B side then delves into a mysterious zone of tunes that have an almost eerie, atmospheric quality. They seem to tell stories, even when no words are spoken.\n\nNo denying that &quot;What Time is Love&quot; changed the face of music in the early 90&amp;#039;s.  A really fun album, but really campy too, although I suspect a lot of that was on purpose.  I think a lot of people took this too seriously.  I dig the steel guitar on &quot;Build a Fire&quot; - easily my favorite moment on the album.  This album was ahead of its time, I think every edition of Jock Jams owes quite a bit to the KLF.\n\n\n1 What Time Is Love? (LP Mix) 5:17 \n2 Make It Rain 3:37 \n3 3 A.M.
