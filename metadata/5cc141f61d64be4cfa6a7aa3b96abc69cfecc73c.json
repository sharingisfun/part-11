I've provided the installer and crack in case the game itself doesn't work, since sometimes transferring already installed files to other computers can be a bit iffy sometimes.  The installer itself is directly from Gamehouse, so if your antivirus comes up (such as mine did when I finished installing), then don't worry about it.  It probably just doesn't like Gamehouse games.\n\nAlso, for people who aren't used to the whole &quot;crack&quot; system (if it's needed), I've also thrown in some simple instructions to help you out.  But enough about that, here's a description from Big Fish Games:\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n 2nd Runner-Up Best Puzzle Game of 2007\nWelcome to the Dream Chronicles, where the lines between reality and fantasy fade away.
