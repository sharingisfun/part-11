If he plays for your team, you love him. If he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t . . .\n\nEveryone thinks they know Bellamy. Pace and passion. A handful for defenders. Scoring goals and winding up opponents. Winning friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and making enemies. \n\nBlessed with a natural talent, he has enjoyed a colourful career at a host of top clubs. The proud Welshman is one of the top ten appearance makers for his country. But his rise to the top of the game wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy. It could have all been so different.\n\nHe came from a loving family but temptations lay in his way. Follow the crowd or follow a dream? Join your mates in a gang on the streets or try to make it as a pro? It was a choice between the two.\n\nBellamy chose football and became a rebel with a cause. He quickly climbed the ladder and shared dressing rooms with some of the biggest stars in football Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Ryan Giggs to Steven Gerrard. His burning desire to succeed made him a winner on the pitch, but that same passion also got him into trouble. There were famous bust-ups with John Arne Riise and Alan Shearer, not to mention rows with Graeme Souness, Rafa Benitez and Roberto Mancini.\n\nAway from the spotlight, there is a different side to Bellamy. His earnings from this book will be going to the Craig Bellamy Foundation, a charity which offers children in Sierra Leone the chance to fulfill their sporting potential. He is a devoted Dad and was heartbroken at the tragic and shocking death of his close friend Gary Speed.\n\nCraig Bellamy: GoodFella uncovers the real man behind the player and reveals the untold stories of a life inside footballÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast lane.\n\nLike Bellamy himself, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf1175699f21c469a601f923a6dda542578e584","amp;dn":"Goodfella+-+My+Autobiography+By+Craig+Bellamy.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf1175699f21c469a601f923a6dda542578e584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,241,23,86,153,242,28,70,154,96,31,146,58,109,218,84,37,120,229,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
