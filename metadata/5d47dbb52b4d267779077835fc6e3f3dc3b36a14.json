Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription of The Cloud of Unknowing and Other Works:\n\nAt a time when the whole of Western Europe was in the grip of the Black Death and the Hundred Years War there was a great flourishing of spiritual works. The Cloud of Unknowing is part of this tradition and although the exact identity of its author remains obscure, he was probably an English country patron of the late fourteenth century. The main theme of this book is that God cannot be reached by human intellect but only by a love that can pierce the 'cloud of unknowing.'\n\nThis edition contains three other works by the same author - The Epistle of Privy Counsel, Dionysius' Mystical Teaching (Dionise Hid Divinite) and The Epistle of Prayer - which illuminate further the close relationship between medieval spirituality and mysticism.\n\ndescription of The Study of Wisdom:\n\nThis short book consists of those works by the Cloud author that would not fit in the Clifton Wolters edition of The Cloud of Unknowing issued by Penguin.\n\nNote: The Wolters translation is now out of print and has been replaced by Penguin with a new translation by A.C. Spearing.\n\nFor another great classic of medieval English mysticism published by Penguin see this:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8269545/Julian_of_Norwich_-_Revelations_of_Divine_Love_(pdf)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8269545/Julian_of_Norwich_-_Revelations_of_Divine_Love_(pdf)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d47dbb52b4d267779077835fc6e3f3dc3b36a14","amp;dn":"The+Cloud+of+Unknowing+and+Other+Works+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d47dbb52b4d267779077835fc6e3f3dc3b36a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,71,219,181,43,77,38,119,121,7,120,53,252,110,63,61,195,179,106,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
