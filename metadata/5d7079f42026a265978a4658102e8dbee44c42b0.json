You have one minute to choose\n which drivers you want to include, if you let the timer count down,\n then the default drivers will be included which are: Chipset, CPU,\n Lan Ethernet, Sound and Wireless LAN. If you want to include the \n graphics drivers then you will need to be there to tick the three\n boxes on the driver selector.\n\n\n UNATTENDED INSTALLATIONS...\n\n All six Windows installations are fully unattended. After installation,\n you should open the eXPerience desktop folder and then open the &quot;Keyboard\n Settings&quot; folder. With these unattended installations, all keyboards are\n set to &quot;US English&quot;.\n\n\n WINDOWS UPDATES...\n\n All of these installations include all of the required &quot;security only&quot;\n hotfixes, updating the OS to October 2011. Later versions of Internet\n Explorer and Windows Media Player are not added. This includes the\n original IE6 and original WMP9/10 but they are also securely patched\n with their respective updates, to October 2011.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n - Windows XP Professional SP3\n\n This is the complete Windows XP Professional SP3 x86 updated to October\n 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition has the original IE6 and WMP9.\n Everything is updated. Nothing at all is removed.\n\n\n - TinyXP Rev12\n\n This is a cut down version of Windows XP Professional SP3 x86 updated\n to October 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition has the original\n IE6 and WMP9. Everything is updated. Many items are removed in this\n version, which is approximately half the size of full Windows XP.\n This version removes Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages, Movie\n Maker, Internet Information Services (IIS) and various other items.\n To check exactly what is removed, open the &quot;Last Session.ini&quot; file\n here on the DVD: &quot;XP02\\$OEM$\\Last Session.ini&quot; and look under the\n section &quot;[Components]&quot; to see what is removed.\n\n\n - MicroXP v0.87\n\n This is a very small version of Windows XP Professional SP3 x86\n updated to October 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition does\n not include Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player at all.\n Everything is updated. This edition is about as cut down as it can\n be and is only intended for gaming and squeezing life out of the oldest\n computers, however, many people use this version full time and use all\n the same programs and play all the same games as on full XP. Programs\n most likely not to work with this edition are gigantic Microsoft apps\n like Microsoft Office. Other software that relies on MDAC or the Jet\n Database will not work, because  those items are removed. This version\n of Windows is less than a quarter of the size of full Windows. An extreme\n amount of components are removed, to check exactly what is removed, open\n the &quot;Last Session.ini&quot; file here on the DVD: &quot;XP03\\$OEM$\\Last Session.ini&quot;\n and look under the section &quot;[Components]&quot; to see what is removed. Then\n also look under the section &quot;[RemoveFiles]&quot; to see individual files also\n removed.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n - Windows Server 2003 SP2\n\n The three versions of Windows Server 2003 are roughly the same as the\n above XP versions in terms of what is removed. So the full Server 2003\n has nothing at all removed, Tiny2003 has the same items taken out as\n TinyXP has (but UDDI and Windows Media Services are removed in 2003)\n and the same goes for Micro2003, it has pretty much the same files\n removed as MicroXP does. \n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n WHY IS SERVER 2003 INCLUDED ANYWAY?\n\n I found all the way back in 2003 when Windows Server 2003 was released\n that it runs faster and better than XP. This is something home users\n simply do not know anything about, but once you try Server 2003 you\n will realize Explorer is faster, copying files is faster, loading and\n using programs and games is faster... but the catch is a few programs\n will not install on a Server (or as they sometimes call it a &quot;.NET\n Server&quot; operating system). Luckily these are mostly blocks on .MSI\n files and there are included fixes in the desktop eXPerience folder\n to get around this blocking of installation. Once installed, the apps\n work just as they do on XP and it is often the case that the only\n reason you couldn't use the program on Server 2003 was the MSI file\n that installs the program was coded to deliberately refuse to install\n on a Server operating system. For EXE files there is also a fix,\n using &quot;Application Verifier&quot; to fool whatever you're installing\n into thinking the OS is XP SP3.\n\n Server 2003 on this DVD is intended to be used as a workstation OS\n and all three installations of Server 2003 are tweaked that way.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n To install Windows from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot from\n the CD/DVD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.\n\n You do not need any product key for any of the installations.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n DRIVERS\n\n You have the following drivers included:\n\n - Chipset --------&gt; (included by default)\n - CPU ------------&gt; (included by default)\n - Graphics -------&gt; (NOT included by default!)\n - LAN Ethernet ---&gt; (included by default)\n - SATA -----------&gt; (included by default)\n - Sound ----------&gt; (included by default)\n - Wireless LAN ---&gt; (included by default)\n\n When the PC reboots for the first time during installation (just after\n Windows files have copied) then you will see a driver selector pop up.\n\n If you do not catch this in time, or are not sat at the PC when this\n driver selector has timed out (after one minute) then all the drivers\n will extract - bear in mind, this will take a few gigabytes of disk\n space. If you do not want to extract the driverpacks, make sure you\n are sat at the PC after the files have copied and it reboots.\n\n The alternative to that is to make your own standalone ISO from the\n ISO folder on the DVD. This way there is no timer, or driverpacks.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n eXPerience folder (Desktop) \n\n Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise\n would be buried away in the Windows GUI, or require DOS style commands.\n\n The folder differs from XP to Server 2003.\n\n INCLUDED WITH XP ONLY:\n\n Check WGA Status - (see if Windows is still &quot;genuine&quot;)\n System Restore - (turn on or off)\n\n\n INCLUDED WITH SERVER 2003 ONLY:\n\n Data Execution Prevention - (turn on or off here)\n Hard Drive Not Showing - (link to Disk Management)\n Program Compatibility Fixer - (force certain programs to install)\n\n\n INCLUDED WITH BOTH XP AND SERVER 2003:\n\n DeskSave - (save desktop icon layout, in case icons are rearranged)\n Hibernation - (turn on or off)\n Keyboard Settings - (quick access to Regional and Language options)\n Registry Backup - (backup the entire registry in one click)\n Services Configuration Files - (save RAM by disabling useless services)\n ShrinkXP Scripts - (safely remove files from the installation)\n System Volume Information - (lock/unlock)\n User Password - (quick access to &quot;Userpasswords2&quot; command)\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Included programs...\n\n APPS Folder (on DVD)\n\n APPS\\PORTABLE contains many portable programs. To use these programs,\n you need to extract the included archive to your hard disk drive.\n Open the archive with WinRAR or 7-Zip. Some of these programs might\n not be the latest version...\n\n Agent Ransack v1.7.3.332\n Boilsoft Video Joiner v5.32\n Boilsoft Video Splitter v5.16\n CCleaner v3.12.1572\n Comodo System Cleaner v2.1.114194.1\n CueClub\n Dead Pixel Buddy\n DeVeDe v3.12.2\n Dir2Txt\n Duplicate File Finder v3.5\n ExamDiff Pro v3.1.4.8\n Firefox v7.0.1\n Foobar2000 v1.0\n FRD v 0.85 u1 b566\n GIF Movie Gear v4.2\n Google Earth v6.0.2.2074\n HandBrake v0.9.4\n Hex Workshop v6.0.1.4603\n Internet Explorer 8\n ImageShack Uploader v2.2\n Img Burn v2.5.5.0\n InstallRite v2.5\n JDownloader v0.9.581\n Levelator v2.1.1\n MP3 Splitter &amp; Joiner v3.03.1\n Nero v10.2.11000.12.100\n Nicotine+ v1.2.10 With GTK+ v2.16.0\n Office Excel Powerpoint Word 2003\n Opera v11.10\n Photoshop v10 CS3 Lite\n PowerArchiver 2010 v11.50.41\n PowerDVD v10.0.0.2113 Ultra\n Process Explorer v11.33\n Registry Mechanic v8.0.0.900\n Resource Hacker v3.4.0.79\n Resource Tuner v1.9.9.R3\n Shutdown Timer v1.0.3\n SMplayer v0.6.9.3607\n SoftMaker Office 2010 Rev 570\n Sound Forge 9.0a Build 297 LITE\n SpaceMonger v2.1.1550\n Spoon Studio 2011 v9.5.2025\n Startup Control Panel v2.8\n TCP View v3.03\n TextAloud v2.285 With Paul\n ThinApp v4.6.1.361923 (No Splash)\n TuneUp Utilities 1 Click 2010 v9.0.3000.136\n UltimateDefrag v3.0.100.39\n UltraISO v9.3.6.2750\n Unstoppable Copier v2.28\n uTorrent v3.0.0.25824\n Video MP3 Extractor v1.6.0.35\n VirtualDJ v5.2.1\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Silent Installers\n\n APPS\\SILENT contains a small collection of silent and automatic\n installations of programs not suitable to be made portable.
