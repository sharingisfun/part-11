Although I must say very little real Qawwali on this record. Hopefully this will lead you to explore more.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nThe late, great Pakistani Qawwali singer's first collaboration with producer/guitarist Michael Brook took the passionate, gymnastic tenor out of tradition and into trip-hop nation. Recorded at Peter Gabriel's expansive Real World Studios, the album combines ethnic percussion, programmed beats (some by Gabriel himself), Brook's atmospheric and infinite guitar swells, and loop-based motifs with Khan's complex, ornamented vocal delivery and devotional lyrics. On the later Night Song, Brook and Khan perfected their cross-cultural dialogue, though Mustt, with its fiery vocal runs and funky, ethereal production, has become an important touchstone in the ethno-techno movement that includes Transglobal Underground and Loop Guru.\n-- amazon.com\n\nTracks\n01- Mustt Mustt (Lost In His Work)\n02- Nothing Without You (Tery Bina)\n03- Tracery\n04- The Game\n05- Taa Deem\n06- Sea Of Vapours\n07- Fault Lines\n08- Tana Dery Na\n09- Shadow\n10- Avenue\n11- Mustt Mustt (Massive Attack Remix)\n\nArtwork (downloaded from cover-paradise.to), EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7bc94a5b1703cea601bf302d9aace1a5766b84","amp;dn":"Nusrat+Fateh+Ali+Khan+-+Mustt+Mustt+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7bc94a5b1703cea601bf302d9aace1a5766b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,123,201,74,91,23,3,206,166,1,191,48,45,154,172,225,165,118,107,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
