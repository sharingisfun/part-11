The facility was owned and operated by the band's manager and producer, James William Guercio, and eventually became the group's retreat for their next five (non-compilation) long-players. Another and perhaps more significant change was the incorporation of several &quot;outside&quot; additional musicians â€” most notably Laudir De Oliveira (percussion), who would remain with the band for the next seven years and eight LPs. \r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Critics' Choice&quot;   Robert Lamm Robert Lamm 2:49 \r\n2. &quot;Just You 'n' Me&quot;   James Pankow Peter Cetera 3:42 \r\n3. &quot;Darlin' Dear&quot;   Lamm Lamm 2:56 \r\n4. &quot;Jenny&quot;   Terry Kath Terry Kath 3:31 \r\n5. &quot;What's This World Coming To&quot;   Pankow Lamm, Cetera, Kath 4:58 \r\n6. &quot;Something in This City Changes People&quot;   Lamm Lamm/Kath 3:42 \r\n7. &quot;Hollywood&quot;   Lamm Lamm 3:52 \r\n8. &quot;In Terms of Two&quot;   Peter Cetera Cetera 3:29 \r\n9. &quot;Rediscovery&quot;   Lamm Lamm 4:47 \r\n10.&quot;Feelin' Stronger Every Day&quot;   Cetera/Pankow Cetera 4:15 \r\n\r\n\r\nChicago:\r\n\r\nPeter Cetera â€“ bass, lead &amp; background vocals, harmonica on &quot;In Terms of Two&quot;\r\nTerry Kath â€“ electric &amp; acoustic guitars, slide guitar, lead &amp; background vocals\r\nRobert Lamm â€“ piano, Hammond organ, clavinet, Wurlitzer electric piano, Fender Rhodes, synthesizer, Hohner Pianet, lead &amp; background vocals\r\nLee Loughnane â€“ trumpet, background vocals, percussion\r\nJames Pankow â€“ trombone, brass arrangements\r\nWalter Parazaider â€“ saxophones, flute\r\nDanny Seraphine â€“ drums, percussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWakeu up!\r\n\r\n\r\n11:21 PM 9/4/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d909d1e879051d9ae5b0df7706877d3ad30fc88","amp;dn":"Chicago+-+1973+-+Chicago+VI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d909d1e879051d9ae5b0df7706877d3ad30fc88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,144,157,30,135,144,81,217,174,91,13,247,112,104,119,211,173,48,252,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
