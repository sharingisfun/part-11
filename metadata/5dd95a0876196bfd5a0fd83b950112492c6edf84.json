It can dramatically reduce the amount of time spent coding both basic and complex functionality within a website or web application. In the workshop author and trainer Kevin Ruse teaches you the fundamentals of jQuery, which is essentially a code library designed to reduce your development time. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to work with the jQuery wrapper, selectors, elements, attributes, events, effects, and more. In no time, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be up and running and ready to explore the more complex areas of jQuery development.\n\nInfo: https://video2brain.com/en/courses/getting-started-with-jquery\n\nPlease SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dd95a0876196bfd5a0fd83b950112492c6edf84","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Getting+Started+with+jQuery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dd95a0876196bfd5a0fd83b950112492c6edf84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,217,90,8,118,25,107,253,90,15,216,59,149,1,18,73,44,110,223,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
