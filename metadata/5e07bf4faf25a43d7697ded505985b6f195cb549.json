None of these songs are on the Greatest Hits release (C0A04CCE75BA805846DC595C28BA757C495F347F) so it's a good find to complete the collection - Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy Richard T\n\nI was vaguely familier with Eddie Money's music, back in the late 70's during my adolescent years by hearing his songs on the radio. I was in High school in 1980 and remember when this album was released. I can still remember seeing his performance of Trinidad on the Midnight Special while promoting the new album. It's a great Eddie Money album. The first three releases of: Eddie Money, Life for the Taking, and Playing For Keeps make one solid trilogy of work. Jimmy Lyons guitar work is simply phenomenal.\n\nI've never understood why this cd was not as widely available as his first two? To me, it's just as good. I was lucky enough to spot a copy of this in my local record store back in the early 90's and purchase it before it went right back out-of-print, seemingly ever since. I once heard an interview with Eddie in the mid-eighty's (possibly on Rock-Line) where he commented on this album saying &quot;instead of going Gold, it went straight to cardboard&quot;. Obviously, sales of this album were very poor, and the record company has never forgotten that. His other two albums did produce a few hits like &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Baby Hold On&quot; but, an album doesn't have to have a &quot;Hit&quot; to be good. Hopefully, if Eddie's catalog of work is ever &quot;remastered&quot; the fans will finally get to purchase this gem without spending a fortune.\n\nIf you can get a copy, grab it! You won't be dissappointed\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nEddie Money - Playing for Keeps\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1980\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
