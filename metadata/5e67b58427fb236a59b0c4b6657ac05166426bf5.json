Each page succinctly demonstrates two to three gestures, giving the meaning and the area of the world where this gesture is used. \n\nThe small line drawings that clarify each gesture make this book superior to similar &quot;dictionary&quot; books on the subject. The book does suffer slightly in two regards. \n\nFirst, an index to meanings would have helped; short of scanning the entire book, there is no way to find all the gestures that, for example, express &quot;love.&quot; \n\nSecond, the book is organized by body parts, but where does the reader look if a gesture uses two or more body parts? \n\nA double listing might have been more helpful. This title will complement Morris's earlier works, Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behavior (1977) and Gestures (1979, co-authored) and is recommended for larger public and academic libraries.
