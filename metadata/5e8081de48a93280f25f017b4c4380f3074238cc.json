IOS is powerful and flexible, but also confusing and daunting. Most tasks can be accomplished in several different ways. And you don&amp;#039;t want to spend precious time figuring out which way is best when you&amp;#039;re trying to solve a problem quickly. That&amp;#039;s what this cookbook is for. Fortunately, most router configuration tasks can be broken down into several more or less independent steps: you configure an interface, you configure a routing protocol, you set up backup links, you implement packet filters and other access control mechanisms. What you really need is a set of recipes that show you how to perform the most common tasks, so you can quickly come up with a good configuration for your site. And you need to know that these solutions work: you don&amp;#039;t want to find yourself implementing a backup link at 2 A.M. because your main link is down and the backup link you set up when you installed the router wasn&amp;#039;t quite right. Thoroughly revised and expanded, &quot;Cisco IOS Cookbook, 2nd Edition&quot; adds sections on MPLS, Security, IPv6, and IP Mobility and presents solutions to the most common configuration problems, including: configuring interfaces of many types, from serial to ATM and Frame Relay; configuring all of the common IP routing protocols (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP); configuring authentication; configuring other services, including DHCP and NTP; setting up backup links, and using HSRP to configure backup routers; managing the router, including SNMP and other solutions; and using access lists to control the traffic through the router. If you work with Cisco routers, you need a book like this to help you solve problems quickly and effectively. Even if you&amp;#039;re experienced, the solutions and extensive explanations will give you new ideas and insights into router configuration. And if you&amp;#039;re not experienced - if you&amp;#039;ve just been given responsibility for managing a network with Cisco routers - this book could be a job-saver.\n\nMore Info: \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e8081de48a93280f25f017b4c4380f3074238cc","amp;dn":"eb-Cisco+IOS+Cookbook-2nd+Edition.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e8081de48a93280f25f017b4c4380f3074238cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,128,129,222,72,169,50,128,242,95,1,123,76,67,128,243,7,66,56,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
