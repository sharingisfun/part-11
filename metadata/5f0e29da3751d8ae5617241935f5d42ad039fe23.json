It stresses the linear case of the inverse function and rank theorems and gives a careful geometric treatment of the spectral theorem.\r\n\r\nAn Engaging Treatment of the Interplay among Algebra, Geometry, and Mappings\r\n\r\nThe text starts with basic questions about images and pre-images of mappings, injectivity, surjectivity, and distortion. In the process of answering these questions in the linear setting, the book covers all the standard topics for a first course on linear algebra, including linear systems, vector geometry, matrix algebra, subspaces, independence, dimension, orthogonality, eigenvectors, and diagonalization.\r\n\r\nA Smooth Transition to the Conceptual Realm of Higher Mathematics\r\n\r\nThis book guides students on a journey from computational mathematics to conceptual reasoning. It takes them from simple &quot;identity verification&quot; proofs to constructive and contrapositive arguments. It will prepare them for future studies in algebra, multivariable calculus, and the fields that use them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0e29da3751d8ae5617241935f5d42ad039fe23","amp;dn":"Linear+Algebra%2C+Geometry+and+Transformation+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0e29da3751d8ae5617241935f5d42ad039fe23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,14,41,218,55,81,216,174,86,23,36,25,53,245,212,42,208,57,254,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
