It's easy to get caught up right away, thinking this guy is the real deal. But how many times has an artist released an album with a killer title track that is clearly the only gem on the album?\n\nNo need to brace for such disappointment here.\n\n&quot;Worried Man&quot; &quot;is just a delicious appetizer for a hearty feast of Americana tunes, many accented with killer pedal steel -- it's tough not to love that. Whether Combs is going for a rock edge such as on the title track or other uptempo songs such as the gritty, guitar anthem &quot;Big Bad Love&quot; or one of his don't miss ballads such as stand-out track &quot;Too Stoned to Cry,&quot; his music is a delight.\n\nCombs will tour with some major Americana artists before he goes out on the road himself later this year. It really doesn't matter where you see him -- just go.\n\nGet ready to watch Andrew Combs join Jason Isbell, Justin Townes Earle and other young guns in setting the musical pace for the next wave of Americana.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2211cd949f857b6d693dbb398cc9f88236f0f6","amp;dn":"Andrew+Combs+-+Worried+Man+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2211cd949f857b6d693dbb398cc9f88236f0f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,34,17,205,148,159,133,123,109,105,61,187,57,140,201,248,130,54,240,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
