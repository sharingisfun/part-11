Herlihy has dedicated many years of research and study to uncovering this history, and the result is a comprehensive genealogy of the two-wheeled savior of mass transit. In the late 1700s, when transportation was ruled by the horse and buggy, inventors challenged one another to develop a human-powered vehicle to replace the inconvenience and expense of the horse-drawn carriage and make man, once and for all, self-sufficient. It took nearly 200 years for the four-wheeled, multi-person machines first thought to be the answer to this dilemma to evolve into the two-wheeled speedsters we know today. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid account of this story could not be more detailed if Herlihy himself had personally lived through every experience he recounts. Each chapter is filled with eye-catching illustrations and photographs spanning nearly two centuries, and colorful sidebars like &quot;The Velocipede in the Service of Love&quot; and &quot;Women and the Velocipede&quot; add character to the often technical, textbook-style prose. In uncovering interesting characters like 1860Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s racer James Moore, who predicted bicycles would soon be &quot;as common in homes as umbrellas,&quot; and documenting hundreds of little known facts, Herlihy takes what could have been just another history book and makes it a story worth telling your friends about.
