File size is reduced since last time I forgot to do a clean after building.\n\nFor those limited to 1.5GB RAM option:\nYou MUST use 64bit Java to allow more than 1.5GB memory usage. This is not up to me. It is a limitation of Java and I cannot work around this. \n\nThis update is a bug fix of the Dec 11 release being unable to create and log in with a new user. Existing &quot;remembered&quot; users did not have an issue.\nIt was a stupid little mistake from trying to rush an update out as damage control for Mojang's recent changes. I have verified that multiple new users can be added, remembered, and used on both Windows and Linux.\n\nTo build source:\nRun &quot;mvn clean install&quot; in LauncherCore-master\nRun &quot;mvn clean package&quot; in TechnicLauncher-master\nYour new build will be in TechnicLauncher-master/target\nYou will have both an EXE and JAR if built on Windows.\n\nIf you have any issues:\nUse the comments section below OR\nemail: 6.forty AT g mail OR\njabber: 6.forty AT jabber.de\n\nAlso if anyone can tell me how to remove torrents, I would appreciate it greatly. I can't remember the last time the &quot;delete torrent&quot; button has actually worked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f63fbf099926459c10d485ab862973c5e5f6c05","amp;dn":"Technic+Launcher+cracked+%28Updated+Dec+11+%2B+New+Users+Fix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f63fbf099926459c10d485ab862973c5e5f6c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,99,251,240,153,146,100,89,193,13,72,90,184,98,151,60,94,95,108,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
