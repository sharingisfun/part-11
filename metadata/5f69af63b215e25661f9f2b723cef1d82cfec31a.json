Initially marketed as a singer/songwriter, John soon revealed he could craft Beatlesque pop and pound out rockers with equal aplomb. He could dip into soul, disco, and country, as well as classic pop balladry and even progressive rock. His versatility, combined with his effortless melodic skills, dynamic charisma, and flamboyant stage shows, made him the most popular recording artist of the '70s. Unlike many pop stars, John was able to sustain his popularity, charting a Top 40 single every single year from 1970 to 1996. During that time, he had temporary slumps in creativity and sales, as he fell out of favor with critics, had fights with his lyricist, Bernie Taupin, and battled various addictions and public scandals. But through it all, John remained a remarkably popular artist, and many of his songs -- including &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; -- became contemporary pop standards. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.76% CDDA &amp; 99.12% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal Music Japan\nCatalogue:\t\tUICZ-1072 &amp; UICZ-1073\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Your Song\n02.Tiny Dancer\n03.Honky Cat\n04.Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long Long Time)\n05.Crocodile Rock\n06.Daniel\n07.Saturday Night`s Alright For Fighting\n08.Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n09.Candle In The Wind\n10.Bennie And The Jets\n11.Don`t Let The Sun Go Down On Me\n12.The Bitch Is Back\n13.Philadelphia Freedom\n14.Someone Saved My Life Tonight\n15.Island Girl\n16.Don`t Go Breaking My Heart (With Kiki Dee)\n17.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n\nDisc 2\t\n\n01.Blue Eyes\n02.I`m Still Standing\n03.I Guess That`s Why They Call It The Blues\n04.Sad Songs (Say So Much)\n05.Nikita\n06.Sacrifice\n07.The One\n08.It`s Me That You Need (Mono)\n09.Can You Feel The Love Tonight\n10.Circle Of Life\n11.Believe\n12.Something About The Way You Look Tonight\n13.Written In The Stars (With Leann Rimes)\n14.I Want Love\n15.Your Song (With Alessandro Safina)\n16.Song For Guy\n17.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word (Blue Feat.
