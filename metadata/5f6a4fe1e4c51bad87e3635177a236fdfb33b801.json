They were later joined by Itamar Goldwasser (Drums) and Dima Grossman (Bass) and finally emerged with their debut album \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;What if\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; which was self released in May 2011.\n\nThe album explores many levels of experience and emotion, making each song unique, with its own style and point of view.\n\nLike different facets of a complex personality, What If gives us a first glimpse of EarlyRise, unfolding before us with each song.\n\n\n\n~~~~DETAILS~~~~\n---------------\n\nFirst Torrent released by me, so please leave a comment and let me know how I did.\n\nAll songs above broadcast quality (above 128kbs). This is the complete \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;What If\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; album released by this small band last year. I have not found another torrent for it, so here it is in superb quality. Hopefully people will enjoy there music. They are a small band that deserve to be enjoyed.\n\n//////////REMEMBER//////////\n\nIf you like it, buy it!
