Unlike other titles about JBoss, the authors of JBoss in Action go deeper into the advanced features and configuration of the server. In particular, it focuses on enterprise-class topics, such as high availability, security, and performance.\nThis book walks readers through the JBoss 5 Application Server from installation to configuration to production development. It shows how to configure the serverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s various component containers such as the JBoss Web Server, the EJB 3 server, and JBoss Messaging. It also provides detailed insight into configuring the various component services such as security, performance, and clustering. Beyond coverage of the core application server, the book also teaches how to use some of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“hotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technologies that run on top of the application server, such as Jboss Seam and JBoss Portal.\nThe authors, both seasoned professional experts at developing and administering JBoss, provide meaningful explanations and background on many topics which they tie in with their own practical, real-world advice from their collective experience. These uniquely comprehensive explanations and the wide coverage provided in this book surpass any other content currently available in any other book, article, or documentation on the subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7dc47c6e4c138832f1e3db18d1e14adc5a4983","amp;dn":"JBoss+in+Action+Configuring+the+JBoss+Application+Server+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7dc47c6e4c138832f1e3db18d1e14adc5a4983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,125,196,124,110,76,19,136,50,241,227,219,24,209,225,74,220,90,73,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
