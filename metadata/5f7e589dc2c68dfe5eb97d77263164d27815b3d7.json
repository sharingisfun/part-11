Providing a balanced account of all the imaging modalities available Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including plain film, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide imaging and interventional radiology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it explains the techniques used and the indications for their use.\n\nOrganised by body system, it covers all anatomical regions. In each region the authors discuss the most suitable imaging technique and provide guidelines for interpretation, illustrating clinical problems with normal and abnormal images.\n\nDiagnostic Imaging is extensively illustrated throughout, featuring high quality full-colour images and more than 600 photographs. The images are downloadable in PowerPoint format from the brand new companion website at www.wileydiagnosticimaging.com, which also has over 100 interactive MCQs, to aid learning and teaching.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7e589dc2c68dfe5eb97d77263164d27815b3d7","amp;dn":"Diagnostic+Imaging%2C+7E-+Rockall+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7e589dc2c68dfe5eb97d77263164d27815b3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,126,88,157,194,198,141,254,94,185,125,119,38,49,100,210,120,21,179,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
