The progress of his spiritual odyssey involves him with some of Maugham's most brilliant characters - his fiancÃƒÂ©e Isabel whose choice between love and wealth have lifelong repercussions, and Elliott Templeton, her uncle, a classic expatriate American snob.  Maugham himself wanders in and out of the story, to observe his characters struggling with their fates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8f78519fda9bbca0f318277238747432112512","amp;dn":"W_Somerset_Maugham_The_Razors_Edge_1944.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8f78519fda9bbca0f318277238747432112512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,143,120,81,159,218,155,188,160,243,24,39,114,56,116,116,50,17,37,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
