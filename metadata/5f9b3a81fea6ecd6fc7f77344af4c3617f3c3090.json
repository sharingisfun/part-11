And, Even With The Stones-Y Grind Of &quot;sweet Rosalyn&quot; Or Hippie Spirits Of &quot;love Is A Good Thing,&quot; It Is An Album That Couldn't Have Been Made Any Other Time Than The '90s. As Strange As It May Sound, Sheryl Crow Is A Post-Modern Masterpiece Of Sorts -- Albeit A Mainstream, Post-Alternative, Post-Modern Masterpiece. It May Not Be As Hip Or Innovative As, Say, The Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, But It Is As Self-Referential, Pop-Culture Obsessed, And Musically Eclectic. Throughout The Record, Crow Spins Out Wild, Nearly Incomprehensible Stream-Of-Consciousness Lyrics, Dropping Celebrity Names And Products Every Chance She Gets (&quot;drinking Falstaff Beer/mercedes Ruehl And A Rented Leer&quot;). \n\nOften, These Litanies Don't Necessarily Add Up To Anything Specific, But \nThey're A Perfect Match For The Mess Of Rock, Blues, Alt-Rock, Country, Folk, And \nLite Hip-Hop Loops That Dominate The Record.
