Credits\n\nWhen I was getting my degree in architecture I stumbled upon Tumbleweed and fell in love with the designs. I was fascinated with the idea of building my own house and getting some hands on construction experience.\n\nWhile preparing for my build I bombarded the people at Tumbleweed with questions. Turns out, they were as impressed by my questions as I was with their designs. They flew me from the Midwest out to California for an interview and now I have my dream job working for Tumbleweed!\n\nWhen the idea of making the Tumbleweed Construction Video was proposed I literally jumped at the opportunity to host and co-produce this how-to instructional DVD that provides answers to so many questions we all have.\n&quot;How do you attach a house to a trailer?&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you secure your roof so it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blow off when traveling down the road?&quot;\n\n&quot;What building materials should you avoid using in a tiny home?&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the difference in plumbing a tiny home compared to a conventional home?&quot;\n\n&quot;What types of trailers should you avoid?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why is framing a tiny house different from framing a conventional home?&quot;\n \n\nTo do this right we gathered some of the best and the brightest in the industry so that they could pass their knowledge on to you. Let me introduce them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ\n\nFirst, we have the Fisher Family. We met Dave, Alan and Ben at a workshop and were blown away by their kindness, integrity and skilled craftsmanship. Today we are proud to say that they are not only official Tumbleweed Builders, but also a cherished part of the Tumbleweed family.\n\nNext, there is Art Cormier; a Tumbleweed do-it-yourselfer who built his home out of mostly recycled materials that we originally discovered on YouTube.\n\nAnd then there is me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Meg Stephens, Tumbleweed's in-house designer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fc225f7ca8227078c9d05ebc231fbf2a2911fea","amp;dn":"Tumbleweed+Construction+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fc225f7ca8227078c9d05ebc231fbf2a2911fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,194,37,247,202,130,39,7,140,157,5,235,194,49,251,242,162,145,31,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
