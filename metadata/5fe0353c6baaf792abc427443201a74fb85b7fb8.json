We spend very little of our mental lives completely in the here and now. Indeed, the power of expectations is so pervasive that we may notice only when somebody pulls back the curtain to reveal a few of the cogs and levers responsible for the big show.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWe all know expectations matterÃ¢â‚¬â€in school, in sports, in the stock market. From a healing placebo to a run on the bank, hints of their self-fulfilling potential have been observed for years. But now researchers in fields ranging from medicine to education to criminal justice are moving beyond observation to investigate exactly how expectations workÃ¢â‚¬â€and when they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nIn Mind Over Mind, journalist Chris Berdik offers a captivating look at the frontiers of expectations research, revealing how our brains work in the future tense and how our assumptionsÃ¢â‚¬â€about the next few milliseconds or the next few yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€bend reality. We learn how placebo calories can fill us up, why wine judges canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t agree, how fake surgery can sometimes work better than real surgery, and how imaginary power can be corrupting. We meet scientists who have found that wearing taller and more attractive avatars in a virtual world boosts confidence in real life, gambling addicts whose brains make losing feel like winning, and coaches who put blurry glasses on athletes to lift them out of slumps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe0353c6baaf792abc427443201a74fb85b7fb8","amp;dn":"Mind+Over+Mind%3A+The+Surprising+Power+of+Expectations+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe0353c6baaf792abc427443201a74fb85b7fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,224,53,60,107,170,247,146,171,196,39,68,50,1,167,79,184,91,127,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
