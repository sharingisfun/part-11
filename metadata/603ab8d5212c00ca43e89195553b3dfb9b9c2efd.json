He never believed the marital rough patch would drag on for a coon's age. Libby McKay knew when she married the gruff, laid-back cowboy that he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prone to blathering about his feelings. But three months have passed and her stubborn-as-a-mule husband is still living by himself in the horse trailer. It seems heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather hold on to his pride than hold on to her. Quinn realizes Libby is determined to move on if he doesn't loosen his tongue and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll lose the only woman he's ever loved. In a last-ditch effort to keep her in his life, he offers her one weekend of uninterrupted sexual decadence. Reigniting the passion is easy. The hard part comes after the sheets have cooled and they find out if what remains is strong enough to survive past mistakes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603ab8d5212c00ca43e89195553b3dfb9b9c2efd","amp;dn":"Lorelei+James-Strong+Silent+Type","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603ab8d5212c00ca43e89195553b3dfb9b9c2efd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,58,184,213,33,44,0,202,67,232,145,149,85,59,61,251,155,156,46,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
