As well as perhaps his most famous hit, &quot;Walking the Dog,&quot; other songs that illustrate Thomas's deep roots in R&amp;B's distant past include the faux-Indian chants of his version of &quot;Sixty Minute Man,&quot; and the rolling '50s R&amp;B of &quot;Strolling Beale Number 1.&quot;\n\nTracklist\n1Walking the Dog - (alternate)  2:35 \n2Ride Your Pony2: \n3Jump Back 2:21 \n4Strolling Beale No. 1 2:25 \n5Do the Funky Chicken 3:18 \n6Funky Hot Grits5:28 \n7Memphis Train '754:57 \n8Bear Cat (A.K.A.
