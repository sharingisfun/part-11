I think Dream Theater are an excellent band and they have some very talented musicians like John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess.\n\nThis is all the official studio albums, all the official live albums. Three of the main EPs and the Greatest Hits compilation. If I haven't included anything it's because I don't think it's important like bootlegs etc.. that are not official releases. There is plenty here to listen to and I have made sure that the tagging is good and that they're presented nicely for you.\n\nThe music files are all MP3s and they're at the same bitrate which is 320kbps/44.1Khz CBR. The best quality you can have for MP3. The reason I didn't do these in flac is because flac is very large and not everybody is suited to passing such large torrents around. This one is fine and is only just over 4.5 gigabytes in size. The quality of the MP3s are superb and they're all encoded from lossless audio quality.\n\nFor those that don't know, Dream Theater, or DT for short, are a Progressive Metal band and they've been around for quite some time now.\n\nPlease help to seed this torrent if you download it and help to pass it around to other torrent downloaders.\n\nThe total time to play all the tracks is 1 day, 9 hours, 35 minutes and 25 seconds. I have included all the covers for you and also tagged each one into the album artwork tag.\n\nI hope you enjoy this release, I know there's other Dream Theater discographies but I take great care in making mine and I enjoy putting them together. I don't like some discographies that people make where they include too much crap like all the singles and bootlegs and other stuff that isn't important.\n\nReleases included as follows:\n\n(1989) Dream Theater - When Dream And Day Unite\n(1992) Dream Theater - Images And Words\n(1994) Dream Theater - Awake\n(1997) Dream Theater - Falling Into Infinity\n(1999) Dream Theater - Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes From A Memory\n(2002) Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence  CD 1\n(2002) Dream Theater - Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence  CD 2\n(2003) Dream Theater - Train Of Thought\n(2005) Dream Theater - Octavarium\n(2007) Dream Theater - Systematic Chaos\n(2009) Dream Theater - Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings  CD 1\n(2009) Dream Theater - Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings  CD 2\n(2009) Dream Theater - Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings  CD 3\n(2011) Dream Theater - A Dramatic Turn Of Events  CD 1\n(2011) Dream Theater - A Dramatic Turn Of Events  CD 2\n(2013) Dream Theater - Dream Theater\n(2008) Dream Theater - Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)  CD 1\n(2008) Dream Theater - Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)  CD 2\n(1993) Dream Theater - Live At The Marquee\n(1995) Dream Theater - A Change Of Seasons\n(2009) Dream Theater - Wither\n(1998) Dream Theater - Once In A Live Time  CD 1\n(1998) Dream Theater - Once In A Live Time  CD 2\n(2001) Dream Theater - Live Scenes From New York  CD 1\n(2001) Dream Theater - Live Scenes From New York  CD 2\n(2001) Dream Theater - Live Scenes From New York  CD 3\n(2004) Dream Theater - Live At Budokan  CD 1\n(2004) Dream Theater - Live At Budokan  CD 2\n(2004) Dream Theater - Live At Budokan  CD 3\n(2006) Dream Theater - Score: 20th Anniversary World Tour  CD 1\n(2006) Dream Theater - Score: 20th Anniversary World Tour  CD 2\n(2006) Dream Theater - Score: 20th Anniversary World Tour  CD 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:608aa2762cf231337402c830dfaf902b309f3e13","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+The+Complete+Discography+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"608aa2762cf231337402c830dfaf902b309f3e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,138,162,118,44,242,49,51,116,2,200,48,223,175,144,43,48,159,62,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
