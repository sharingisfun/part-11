In its social commentary of Italian laws/society, Concini, Germi, and Giannetti (the writers) create well fitted, stereotypical characters that are much needed in order for the message of the film to get across. Ferdinando plays the evil nobleman, Rosalia as the annoying wife, Angela as the desirable secret teen lover, etc. The beauty of the story not only lies in it's scathingly funny humor, with Ferdinando's clever plotting and hallucinations of killing his wife, but also in its ability to transcend time. Nowadays there are no laws that forbid divorce in most societies, but even though that crucial point does not relate to modern audiences, the film is still able to conjure emotions for the characters' plight. Another great thing about the film, is the idea of a protagonist character with typically antagonist characteristics. Ferdinando is definitely a bad man, but the story plays with the audience in making them want Ferdinando to succeed in his plot. To add to the underlying theme of the film, the failure of Italian laws, is the theme of &quot;justice&quot; whether it be from the law or from a simple reversal of fate. Definitely watch the film up to the very end, as it closes with an ironic yet justified twist of fate for the characters involved. \n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Divorzio All'italiana.1961.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 019 Kbps\nLength            : 5.87 GiB for 1h 44mn 47s 709ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 690 (1.855) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : ru\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055913/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Italian\nSubtitles: Italian, English, Portuguese, Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b1fb778ec7a8beebaa43f8e43db5817f241931","amp;dn":"Divorzio+All%27italiana.1961.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b1fb778ec7a8beebaa43f8e43db5817f241931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,177,251,119,142,199,168,190,235,170,67,248,228,61,181,129,127,36,25,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
