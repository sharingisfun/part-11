While Hawkins' strong but weather-beaten voice could communicate sorrow and heartbreak as few others could, he could also summon up a joyous fire that's a wonder to behold, and he could work this magic with practically any song he chose to perform, from Sam Cooke's &quot;Bring It on Home to Me&quot; to John Denver's &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads.&quot; Both of those songs appear on Love You Most of All: More Songs From Venice Beach, which (as the title suggests) features 13 songs from the same 1985 bare-bones guitar and voice sessions that produced Hawkins' Songs From Venice Beach, and, like the earlier album, it consists primarily of tunes Hawkins sang while busking for change along the Venice, CA, boardwalk.  On this disc's best moments, Hawkins stands beside Arthur Alexander as one of the great unacknowledged links between country and R&amp;B. \n\n01. Bring It on Home to Me 3:19\n02.
