It offers a clearly-written introduction both to the ASP.NET MVC Framework and to the MVC approach. The focus is on creating real, maintainable web applicationsÃ¢â‚¬â€so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect toy examples and short snippets. The authors lead you from first-use through real-life scenarios.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the MVC approach is introducing a high degree of testability to your applications and process. ASP.NET MVC in Action shows you how to test each piece of your ASP.NET application and how to introduce principles of test-driven development into your process.\n\nBecause the framework is completely pluggable, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to work with external Inversion of Control containers like StructureMap, Windsor, and Spring.NET and open-source persistence layers like NHibernate. Throughout the book, the authors sprinkle in MvcContrib, an extremely useful tool that provides common extensions so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to write them yourself.\n\nAlong the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll benefit from the wide-ranging experience of the authors, who have extensive experience with ASP.NET, Monorail, and Ruby on Rails. This book assumes that you already know how to build a standard ASP.NET application and presents most examples in C#.
