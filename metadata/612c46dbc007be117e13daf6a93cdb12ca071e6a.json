Traditional reading also consumes huge amounts of physical space on a page or screen, which limits reading effectiveness on small displays. Scrolling, pinching, and resizing a reading area doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the problem and only frustrates people. Now, with compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page. Spritz makes streaming your content easy and more comfortable, especially on small displays. Our Ã¢â‚¬Å“RedicleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technology enhances readability even more by using horizontal lines and hash marks to direct your eyes to the red letter in each word, so you can focus on the content that interests you. Best of all, SpritzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patent-pending technology can integrate into photos, maps, videos, and websites to promote more effective communication.\n\nSpritz vs Traditional Reading\n\nRemoving eye movement associated with traditional reading methods not only reduces the number of times your eyes move, but also decreases the number of times your eyes pass over words for your brain to understand them. This makes Spritzing extremely efficient, precise, convenient and comfortable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612c46dbc007be117e13daf6a93cdb12ca071e6a","amp;dn":"Spritz+%28Speed+Reader%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612c46dbc007be117e13daf6a93cdb12ca071e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,44,70,219,192,7,190,17,126,19,218,246,169,60,219,18,202,7,30,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
