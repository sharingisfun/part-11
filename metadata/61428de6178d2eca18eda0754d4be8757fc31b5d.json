Such process typically involves dithering, quantization, and noise shaping. TB Dither supports industry-standard dithering noise types such as RPDF (rectangular probability density function, 1 LSB wide) and TPDF (triangular probability density function, 2 LSBs wide). A GPDF (Gaussian probability density function) is provided as well.\n\nTB Dither's uniqueness lies in the flexibility to shape and minimize the audibility of noise inherently introduced by bit depth reduction. Instead of providing a very limited set of a few, fixed noise shaping curves, TB Dither allows you to design the spectrum of the quantization noise using familiar tools such as low-shelf, high-shelf and peaking filters, just as any equalizer. This provides the ability to adjust quantization noise spectra according to the audio content, and envisioned reproduction system (s). If you can work with an EQ, you can work with TB Dither.\n\nTo get started, no less than 7 different noise shaping curves are provided and can be recalled from a menu, ranging from threshold-in-quiet curves, inverse dB (A) weighting, inverse ITU-R 468 curves, and several more.\n\n\n\nSystem  requirements\n\n\nThe plugins require a host program that supports the VST 2.4 specification or a host program that supports Apple OSX Audio Units.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Windows XP, Vista, or 7.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Both 32 as well as 64 bit plugin hosts are natively supported.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intel\n\nPentium 4, 1 GHz or higher (with SSE instruction support)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ AMD\n\nAMD Athlon64, 1 GHz or higher (with SSE instruction support).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mac OSX 10.5 (Leopard) or higher.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intel-Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½based processor running at 1 GHz or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n             \n\n              1.
