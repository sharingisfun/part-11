There aren't as many psychedelic flourishes as\nthere were on his first two albums, but the ones that are present enhance his sweeping vision of American roots music. And that sly fusion of styles makes Dr. John's Gumbo one of Dr. John's finest albums.\n\nIn The Right Place Review:\nDr. John finally struck paydirt here and was certainly In the Right Place. With the hit single &quot;Right Place Wrong Time&quot; bounding up the charts, this fine collection saw many unaware listeners being initiated into New Orleans-style rock. Also including Allen Toussaint's &quot;Life,&quot; and a funky little number entitled &quot;Traveling Mood,&quot; which shows off the good doctor's fine piano styling, and with able help from the Meters as backup group, In the Right Place is still a fine collection to own.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61b0cd437b83989e046ca589ab172dc00e374801","amp;dn":"Dr.+John+-+Gumbo+%26amp%3B+In+The+Right+Places+%281972-73%29+%5BAPE%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61b0cd437b83989e046ca589ab172dc00e374801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,176,205,67,123,131,152,158,4,108,165,137,171,23,45,192,14,55,72,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
