Robert Heilbroner, writing about HobsbawmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Age of Extremes 1914-1991 said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I know of no other account that sheds as much light on what is now behind us, and thereby casts so much illumination on our possible futures.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Skeptical, endlessly curious, and almost contemporary with the terrible Ã¢â‚¬Å“short centuryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is the subject of Age of Extremes, his most widely read book, Hobsbawm has, for eighty-five years, been committed to understanding the Ã¢â‚¬Å“interesting timesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ through which he has lived.\n\nInteresting Times: A Twentieth-Century Life\nBy: Eric J.
