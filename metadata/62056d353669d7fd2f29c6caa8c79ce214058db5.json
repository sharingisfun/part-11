Alternative methods  are examined,  and\nexplanations are  supplied of the  fundamental materials and  reasoning behind\ntheories and examples.\n\n\nNo other  current books deal  with this subject, and  the author is  a leading\nauthority  in  the field  of  computer  arithmetic.  The text  introduces  the\nConventional Radix Number  System and the Signed-Digit Number  System, as well\nas Residue Number System and Logarithmic Number System.\n\n\nThis book serves as an essential,  up-to-date guide for students of electrical\nengineering  and computer  and mathematical  sciences, as  well as  practicing\nengineers and  computer scientists  involved in  the design,  application, and\ndevelopment of computer arithmetic units.\n\n\nContents\n========\n\n      Preface  \n      List of Figures  \n      List of Tables  \n      About the Author  \n  1.

She joined the  Department of Electrical  Engineering at\nTexas  A&amp;M University  in  1987 and  is currently  a  professor. Her  research\ninterests include  computer arithmetic, parallel computing,  parallel computer\narchitectures, VLSI algorithms, and computer networks.\n\n\nShe  has published  over  one  hundred technical  papers,  and  has served  as\nassociate  editor  of  the  Journal  of  Computing  and  Information  and  the\nInformation Sciences  Journal. She  was conference  chairperson of  the Fifth,\nSixth,  and   Seventh  International  Conferences  on   Computer  Science  and\nInformatics. She served  on the panel of the National  Science Foundation, the\npanel of the IEEE Workshop on  Imprecise and Approximate Computation, and many\nconference  program  committees. She  is  the  chairperson of  sixty  research\nadvisory committees for masters and doctoral  students. Dr. Lu is a registered\nprofessional engineer and a senior member of the IEEE. She has been recognized\nin Who's Who in America.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0471726214&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0471726214&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62056d353669d7fd2f29c6caa8c79ce214058db5","amp;dn":"Mi+Lu+-+Arithmetic+and+Logic+in+Computer+Systems%2C+1e+%282004%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62056d353669d7fd2f29c6caa8c79ce214058db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,5,109,53,54,105,215,253,47,41,198,202,168,199,156,226,20,5,141,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
