Their next release &quot;Vasos Vacios&quot; is but a compilation album of their greatest hits, with some tracks re-recorded in the US, and some remixes that kinda suck (&quot;Gitana&quot; among them). Or, on the other hand, one could agree with Victor W. Valdivia if we consider that their next studio album, &quot;Rey Azucar&quot; was a weak attempt at recreating &quot;El Leon&quot; with mixed results and overproduction. But even worse, the follow up album, &quot;Los Fabulosos Calavera&quot;, was a complete change of sound attempting to outdo GG Allin and Tin Machine with forgettable tunes, and with plenty of the mierda GG would smear on the audience. Yes, indeed. \r\nThis IS a transitional album. Because after this great record, LFC kind lost their &quot;mojo&quot; and &quot;went Hollywood&quot;, releasing ever decreasing and less likeable albums. &quot;El Leon&quot; is a showcase of LFC at their peak. Quite possibly, the only LFC album worth collecting for its near perfection. an Argentine &quot;Sgt . Pepper's&quot; if you'd like.
