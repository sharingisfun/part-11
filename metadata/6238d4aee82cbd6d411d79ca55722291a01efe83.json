I can&amp;#039;t say enough good things about this movie. Although, if it weren&amp;#039;t for the pinata (played by your boy Ed Gale, of &quot;Cycle Sluts&quot; fame) I wouldn&amp;#039;t have nearly as many good things to say, because most of them concern the pinata. I saw the toned-down version on AMC; I can only imagine what it must be like with swear words (hint:awesome). I started watching it as a joke, but by the end the pinata actually became quite scary. He&amp;#039;s only 4 feet tall, but I think it&amp;#039;s his unrelenting tenacity that does it. Laugh now, but try going to sleep after watching it. If you only see one film about Pinata demons this year, make it this one, without a doubt. Pinatas!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6238d4aee82cbd6d411d79ca55722291a01efe83","amp;dn":"Demon+Island+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6238d4aee82cbd6d411d79ca55722291a01efe83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,56,212,174,232,44,189,109,65,29,121,202,85,114,34,145,160,30,254,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
