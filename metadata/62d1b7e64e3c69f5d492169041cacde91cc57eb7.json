The film was directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay by Goldman. The story is presented in the film as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage), thus effectively preserving the novel's narrative style. This film is number 50 on Bravo's &quot;100 Funniest Movies,&quot; number 88 on The American Film Institute's (AFI) &quot;AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions&quot; list of the 100 greatest film love stories, and 46 in Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Films list.
