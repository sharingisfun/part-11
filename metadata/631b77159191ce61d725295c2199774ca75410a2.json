These highly trained operatives became Victoria's Secret Service. Flash forward 150 years and set in a restricted area inside the Ministry of Defense, only a select few have access to &quot;the Compound.&quot; Inside is a high-tech institution specializing in training England's most elite soldiers. Subject to only the director and the Crown, these soldiers do not exist. Their missions-- relieving any threat associated to the Crown, whether it means going under cover at the meetings of the Houses, or foiling a terrorist's plan-- are what the VSS lives for, literally. Should the day come when they can no longer perform their duties, they will be terminated as swiftly as they once did to others!\n\nThanks goes to Nothing for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631b77159191ce61d725295c2199774ca75410a2","amp;dn":"Victoria%27s+Secret+Service+00+%282005%29+%28Nothing-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631b77159191ce61d725295c2199774ca75410a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,27,119,21,145,145,206,97,215,37,41,92,33,153,119,76,167,84,16,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
