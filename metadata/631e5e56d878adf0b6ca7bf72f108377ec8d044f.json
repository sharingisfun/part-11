Starman is less about pummeling villains as it is about family, reconciliation, Hawaiian print shirts and other collectibles. Golden age callbacks put the history of costumed heroism in the context of relatable issues.\n\nJack Knight is one of the most flawed and topical personalities of the superhero world, an everyman inheriting a mantle he never wanted. Ted Knight becomes an integral supporting character who in fact, eclipses his son in many ways.\n\nThe most complete digital collection of James Robinson's Starman run.\n\nNot present is the original Shade three issue miniseries that has yet to see digital release. Also not present is the Dark Horse / DC Starman-Batman-Hellboy crossover.\n\nMany thanks to the original rippers, especially Deadman Wade. His work has been augmented by the addition of issues #00, #50-51 and annuals #01-02 for the complete Jack Knight storyline. Starman #1000000 can be found in the DC One Million package.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631e5e56d878adf0b6ca7bf72f108377ec8d044f","amp;dn":"Starman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631e5e56d878adf0b6ca7bf72f108377ec8d044f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,30,94,86,216,120,173,240,182,202,123,247,47,16,131,119,236,141,4,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
