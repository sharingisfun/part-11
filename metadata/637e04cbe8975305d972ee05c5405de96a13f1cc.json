Though he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or &quot;spokesman&quot; of the group.\n\nOne of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician. He was well known by many for his distinctive guitar playing and was ranked 13th in Rolling Stone's &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; cover story.\n\nLater in life, Garcia was sometimes ill because of his diabetes, and in 1986 went into a diabetic coma that nearly cost him his life. Although his overall health improved somewhat after that, he also struggled with heroin and cocaine addictions, and was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when he died of a heart attack in August 1995.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGarcia Plays Dylan is an album composed of various live performances featuring Jerry Garcia playing covers of Bob Dylan songs. It is culled from performances from 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995, and features Garcia playing with Grateful Dead, Legion of Mary, Jerry Garcia Band, and Garcia-Saunders.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\n\nJerry Garcia: guitar, vocals\n\n\n\nJerry Garcia &amp; Merl Saunders:\n\n\n\nMerl Saunders: organ\n\nJohn Kahn: electric bass\n\nBill Vitt: drums\n\n\n\nJerry Garcia Band:\n\n\nNicky Hopkins: piano on disc 1, tracks 2-3\n\nJohn Kahn: bass\n\nRon Tutt: drums on disc 1, tracks 2-3 &amp; 5\n\nKeith Godchaux: piano on disc 1, tracks 5-6\n\nDonna Godchaux: vocals on disc 1, track 5\n\nBuzz Buchanan: drums on disc 1, track 6\n\nGloria Jones: vocals on disc 1, track 7, disc 2, tracks 3-5\n\nDavid Kemper: drums on disc 1, track 7, disc 2, tracks 3-5\n\nJackie LaBranch: vocals on disc 1, track 7, disc 2, tracks 3-5\n\nOzzie Ahlers: keyboards on disc 2, track 1\n\nJohnny de Fonseca: drums on disc 2, track \n\n\n\nLegion Of Mary:\n\n\nMerl Saunders: organ\n\nJohn Kahn: bass\n\nRon Tutt: drums\n\nMartin Fierro: saxophone\n\n\n\nGrateful Dead:\n\n\nBob Weir: guitar, vocals\n\nPhil Lesh: bass, vocals\n\nBrent Mydland: keyboards, vocals on disc 2, tracks 2 &amp; 7-8\n\nMickey Hart: drums\n\nBill Kreutzmann: drums\n\nVince Welnick: keyboards on disc 2, track 6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:637e04cbe8975305d972ee05c5405de96a13f1cc","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+-+Garcia+Plays+Dylan+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2005%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BLIVE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"637e04cbe8975305d972ee05c5405de96a13f1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,126,4,203,232,151,83,5,217,114,238,5,197,64,93,233,106,19,241,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
