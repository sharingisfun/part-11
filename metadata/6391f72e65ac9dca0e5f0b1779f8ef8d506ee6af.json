The band's power pop style has been frequently compared to that of contemporaries such as Squeeze, Elvis Costello, Weezer, Tom Petty, Sloan, The Clash, XTC, Franz Ferdinand, Kiss, and The Tubes.\n\nThe band was formed in 1987 in Vancouver, British Columbia, consisting of vocalist-guitarists Craig Northey and Steven Drake, bassist Doug Elliott and drummer Paul Brennan. Band members claim the name came when Brennan asked Drake (in a town somewhere on the BC coast), &quot;What are the odds of us ever escaping bullshit gigs like this?&quot; The band played up to four nights a week as a 1960s and 1970s cover band called Dawn Patrol, while playing as the Odds on weekends, hoping for a break.\n\nThe band traveled to Los Angeles doing showcases and eventually signed to Zoo Entertainment. They released their debut album, Neopolitan, in 1991, which spawned three hits at radio. (&quot;Love Is the Subject&quot; and &quot;King of the Heap&quot;.) The third single was the controversial &quot;Wendy Under the Stars&quot;.\n\nAfter the release of Neopolitan, the band were picked up by Warren Zevon, becoming his touring band for his album Mr. Bad Example.\n\nIn 1993, the band released Bedbugs, which attracted attention for its lead single &quot;Heterosexual Man&quot;. The video for that song featured the band members performing in drag, with Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald and Mark McKinney from The Kids in the Hall (themselves often noted for drag performances) as the stereotypically macho jocks. Three singles from that album charted, &quot;Heterosexual Man&quot;, &quot;It Falls Apart&quot;, and &quot;Yes (Means It Hard To Say No).&quot;\n\nBrennan left the band in 1995, and subsequently joined Big Sugar. He was replaced by Pat Steward, former drummer for Bryan Adams and Matthew Good, and studio drummer for Limblifter.\n\nThe band followed up with 1995's Good Weird Feeling, their most commercially successful album, The album featured the top 40 hit singles &quot;Truth Untold&quot;, &quot;Eat My Brain&quot;, &quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Mercy To Go&quot;. &quot;Eat My Brain&quot; also found a place on the Craig Northey-produced soundtrack to the Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy.\n\nThe Odds' final album, Nest, was released in 1996. The track &quot;Someone Who's Cool,&quot; was originally written for the Friends soundtrack[1]. Follow-up single &quot;Make You Mad&quot; featured a video which was co-directed by and starred Bruce McCulloch, of Kids in the Hall fame.\n\n\n3 ABLUMS @ 192kbps\n\nBedbugs(1993)\n\nGood Weird Feeling(1995)\n\nNest(1996)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6391f72e65ac9dca0e5f0b1779f8ef8d506ee6af","amp;dn":"The+Odds+-+3+Albums+%40+192kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6391f72e65ac9dca0e5f0b1779f8ef8d506ee6af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,145,247,46,101,172,157,202,14,95,11,23,121,248,239,141,80,110,230,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
