We are releasing collections of \nbooks, journal articles, and other documents on a range on important topics in\npure and applied mathematics. Each collection will have a wide selection of \nliterature, much of it from behind paywalls or brand new MYRIAD scans.\n\nOur first release in this series is on Understanding Finance. Everyone cares \nmore about finance nowadays - and we're making sure that you can get hold of\nthe information you need to study and understand it properly.\n\nWhether you're learning stochastic calculus to get a job in finance, trying to\ngrok the system from the outside in order to bring it down, or just curious \nabout all the stories in that section of the paper you used to flick past, \nyou will find something here for you.\n\nThe 'introductory' folder has some basic books that tell you what finance is,\nwhat the stock market is, what derivatives are, and some of the economics you\nmight need to understand all of this. If you got this far, check out the \nencyclopedias and dictionaries of financial terms in the 'reference' folder.\n\nThe 'financial_system' folder has much more detail about the workings of Wall \nStreet, financial markets, and financial products. Check out the subfolders on\n'banks' with articles about Goldman Sachs, quants and the shadow banking system,\nand 'derivatives', which has a lot of technical and nontechnical information\nabout credit derivatives.\n\nThe folder '2008_crisis' brings together a lot of information about the credit\ncrisis, its causes and effects. One ideal starting place is 'The Giant Pool\nof Money', the transcript of an NPR radio show about how mortgages were \nmis-sold to consumers and investors alike. There are sections on auto industry\nbankruptcies, banks, quants and default correlation. Check out the articles \ntaken from ProPublica which have gone further than anyone else to unpick the\ndeals between banks and hedge funds that fueled the mortgage boom.\n\nLast but definitely not least is the 'math' folder. Here we have a huge number\nof books and articles on many aspects of financial math, at all levels from\nintroductory to recent research into advanced financial engineering. Along\nwith subfolders on stochastic calculus, Monte Carlo methods, statistics, \ncredit derivatives, there is a huge collection of books and articles about\nvarious aspects of Brownian motion. Check out the 'heterodox' section which\nincludes Mandelbrot's papers on finance and another book discussing how his\nideas differ from mainstream financial theory.\n\nWe are growing this collection actively and look forward to releasing many more\nbooks and papers in future versions to have the most useful torrent possible.\nPlease send us any book scans, articles from behind paywalls, or other\ndocuments you have that could belong in the next version of this torrent. \n\nFull list of files is in 'filelist'.\n\nMYRIAD WAREZ is the world's foremost release group for mathematical warez. \nRequests, comments, get involved: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5934202b30383d2e382b3c23193e34383035773a3634&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n -~+ NO WAR BUT THE INFORMATION WAR -- NO LAW BUT THE SECOND LAW +~-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6399cd18515e847314d4a7ba009583ae9c3e2130","amp;dn":"MYRIAD+WAREZ+--+Understanding+Finance+Collection+v.+1.0+%28books+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6399cd18515e847314d4a7ba009583ae9c3e2130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,153,205,24,81,94,132,115,20,212,167,186,0,149,131,174,156,62,33,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
