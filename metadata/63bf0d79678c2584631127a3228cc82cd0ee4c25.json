Students are provided with a thorough conceptual grounding in computational problem solving before introducing them to specific Python syntax, thus giving them the background to become successful programmers in any language. Dierbach offers students a thorough grounding in imperative programming before introducing them to object-oriented programming. His step-by-step pedagogical approach makes this an accessible and student-friendly introduction to programming that eases students into program-writing through a variety of hands-on exercises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bf0d79678c2584631127a3228cc82cd0ee4c25","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Computer+Science+Using+Python","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bf0d79678c2584631127a3228cc82cd0ee4c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,191,13,121,103,140,37,132,99,17,39,163,34,140,200,44,208,238,76,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
