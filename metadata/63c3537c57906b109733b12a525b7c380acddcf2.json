Some mysteries of the Universe are beyond man's comprehension,yet they never fail to ignite his curiousity.The very fact that these psychic phenomena can not be exibited by everyone,adds to their peculiar allure. This book is an objective sally into this realm. What gives some mortals these super powers? Science has not yet found all the answers.Hear what the mystics and miracle men say in their own versions of what exactly happens to them on the psychic,physical and metaphysical planes,when they are going through these experiences. Not many books are available on the subject of this kind and readers may find it very interesting.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction vii\n1. Living Burial 1\n2. Supernatural Power from Liquor 18\n3.
