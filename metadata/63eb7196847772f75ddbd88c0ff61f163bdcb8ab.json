In fact, the islands of the Caribbean were forged by volcanoes 150 million years ago, with plant and animal life following some 70 million years later. Typical of the BBC Atlas of the Natural World series is Jaguar's extraordinary photography: frogs and insects suddenly caught in flowing tree sap, crocodiles leaping to pull prey from trees. The story of the Mayans-farmers, astronomers, inventors-moving from the deserts of Mexico down to the jungles of Central America, their lives sustained by slash-and-burn agriculture and good nutrition, is thoroughly covered. So is the tale of the lost civilization of the Aztecs, wanderers for ten generations, who viewed themselves as a chosen people, acted as extinguishers of other peoples in Mexico, and were themselves ultimately destroyed by Spanish conquistadors.\n\n\n\n\n4)  The Fifth World of the Aztecs \n&quot;Spirits of the Jaguar&quot; concludes with the story of the Aztec empire, which in the 1500s stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific in what is now Mexico. Footage includes scenes of hawks that once inspired Aztec myths, and ruins of pyramids and temples.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1797 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 544\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.324 (4:3)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 700 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks To llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/spirits/html/mayabodymaya.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/spirits/html/mayabodymaya.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63eb7196847772f75ddbd88c0ff61f163bdcb8ab","amp;dn":"BBC+Spirits+of+the+Jaguar+4of4+The+Fifth+World+of+the+Aztecs+Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63eb7196847772f75ddbd88c0ff61f163bdcb8ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,235,113,150,132,119,114,247,93,219,216,140,15,246,31,22,59,220,184,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
