The Jet Set\n\n\nThis album stands as one of the greatest synth-pop albums ever recorded. Many of Alphaville's biggest and best songs are here - &quot;A Victory of Love&quot;, &quot;Big In Japan&quot;, &quot;Sounds Like A Melody&quot;, &quot;The Jet Set&quot; and (of course) the title track. The rest of the album is excellent as well, especially &quot;Summer In Berlin&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. Synth-pop at it's absolute best. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 1\nArtist: Alphaville\nAlbum: Forever Young\nYear: 1984\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64198f0b02ade3897ca710f7f6cee980664004ec","amp;dn":"Alphaville+-+Forever+Young+%5BFLAC-1984%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64198f0b02ade3897ca710f7f6cee980664004ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,25,143,11,2,173,227,137,124,167,16,247,246,206,233,128,102,64,4,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
