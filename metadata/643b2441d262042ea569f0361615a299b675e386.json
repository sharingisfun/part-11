Originally the Masters of Evil, their ranks have since been filled by people on both sides of the law, most notably when Hawkeye risked his life and freedom to lead them shortly after they saved the world for the first time (after they themselves endangered it). Baron Zemo, the original leader under the guise of Citizen V, returned several times to the role of leader of the heroes, with mixed results. After saving thousands of lives on Counter Earth, he garnered a taste for the life of hero worship, and decided saving the world a much more enticing risk than conquering it.\nCurrently, the Thunderbolts are under the thumb of the former Green Goblin, Norman Osborn. They serve as his Black Ops team, as he sends them into places where he doesn't want his Dark Avengers to be seen. Conflicted mercenaries and unconcerned villains are currently trying to keep from killing each other.\n\nThe torrent includes issues 1-141, and includes the Citizen V minis, and Avengers crossovers. The Penance miniseries is, unfortunately, incomplete. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:643b2441d262042ea569f0361615a299b675e386","amp;dn":"Thunderbolts+1-141+plus+minis+%28fixed+issues+116+and+126%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"643b2441d262042ea569f0361615a299b675e386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,59,36,65,210,98,4,46,165,105,240,54,22,21,162,153,182,117,227,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
