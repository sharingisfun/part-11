Richard Burton (not the actor)was a historian, an explorer, and a fencer, and he managed to blend all three interests in this fascinating biography of &quot;the Queen of Weapons.&quot; His passion for the sword is obvious as he follows it from its origins in prehistory to Roman times. For Burton, no praise is too great, no detail too small when it comes to the sword. He had a burning desire to illuminate, to tell what he knew, and this he did with the full force of a tidal wave.\r\nOriginally planned as the first of three volumes, THE BOOK OF THE SWORD unfortunately sold poorly when it was first published, so the later volumes never materialized. Today, the book is recognized for the work of art it truly is. As a fencing master and writer, I recommend this book highly.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe history of the sword,â€ the author writes in his introduction, â€œis the history of humanity.â€ For centuries, the sword has been a symbol of power, strength, liberty, and courage. In the Middle Ages, the image of a sword was used to signify the word of God. Nearly every culture in history has forged blades from stone or steel to fight in times of battle and protect in times of peace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646659d1affdcca86826e5597914e338ee1d35e1","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+the+Sword+%28History+Weapon%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646659d1affdcca86826e5597914e338ee1d35e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,102,89,209,175,253,204,168,104,38,229,89,121,20,227,56,238,29,53,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
