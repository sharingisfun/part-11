Born in West Allegheny (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, making France her home for the remainder of her life. A literary innovator and pioneer of Modernist literature, SteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work broke with the narrative, linear, and temporal conventions of 19th-century. She was also known as a collector of Modernist art.\n\nIn 1933, Stein published a kind of memoir of her Paris years, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, written in the voice of Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of cult literary figure into the light of mainstream attention.\n\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: &quot;hermetic&quot; works best illustrated by The Making of Americans: The Hersland Family; popularized writing such as The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which Brewsie and Willie is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, libretti and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: &quot;Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose&quot;; &quot;Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle&quot;; about her childhood home in Oakland, &quot;There is no there there&quot;; and &quot;The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.&quot;\n\nThese stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or &quot;portraits&quot;, were designed to evoke &quot;the excitingness of pure being&quot; and can be seen as literature's answer to Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Many of the experimental works such as Tender Buttons have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on automatic writing with William James, she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Everybody's Autobiography\n\n* How to Write\n\n* Ida\n\n* Narration\n\n* Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein\n\n* The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas\n\n* The Making of Americans\n\n* The World Is Round\n\n* Three Lives\n\n* Wars I Have Seen\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Stein&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Stein&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stein-interview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stein-interview.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648aac662fd07f2bfe441cb70247e66fc513727c","amp;dn":"Gertrude+Stein+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%2810+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648aac662fd07f2bfe441cb70247e66fc513727c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,138,172,102,47,208,127,43,254,68,28,183,2,71,230,111,197,19,114,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
