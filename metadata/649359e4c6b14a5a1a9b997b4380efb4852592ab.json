While Darren strikes up a relationship with real estate agent and sex-friend Jeremy, \nLeo after many failed relationships is disconsolate about having any social life so joins \na New Age men\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s therapy group. In the group session, he comes clean about his feelings for \nanother group member (James Purefoy) which leads to a homosexual affair. Then the situation is \ncomplicated by the re-union with his original high school sweetheart (Jennifer Ehle) and the \nwhole thing transcends into sexual ambiguity. \n\nReviews: \nThis is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted film. It is funny and sometimes hilarious. The finale \nis a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package. The film \nis better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen staging, the camping trip as \nexamples. B &amp; H does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and \nbisexuality. Most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity. In that sense it is \na joyous vacation from homophobic society. And it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening \nof rigid sexual categories--perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come. \n\nCast: \nKevin McKidd ..........  Leo \nJulie Graham ..........
