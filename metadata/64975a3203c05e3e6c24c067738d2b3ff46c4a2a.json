As you can imagine from the title, most of the stories were classic sci-fi/horror - Planet-eating monsters, giant ants a la Them!, and Gorgilla; what do you think it is, based on the name alone? Yes, it is exactly as silly, goofy and ultimately amusing as you might expect but Marvel was overflowing with amazing artists at the time and more than a few got their chance to do off-the-cuff work here. Also, some of the stories are written with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while others try and play their tropes straight - with often hilarious results. Worth checking out if you like this sort of thing, thanks to Brigus for the newer scans. Please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64975a3203c05e3e6c24c067738d2b3ff46c4a2a","amp;dn":"Weird+Wonder+Tales+01-22+%281973-1977%2C+C2C%2C+Brigus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64975a3203c05e3e6c24c067738d2b3ff46c4a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,151,90,50,3,192,94,62,108,36,192,103,115,141,43,63,244,108,74,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
