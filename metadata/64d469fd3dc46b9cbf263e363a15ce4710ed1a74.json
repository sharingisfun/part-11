Despite popular and high regard in his native Scotland and throughout Europe, Martyn did not court fame and did not really catch on in the US, despite the efforts of Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and others to publicize and work. Drink and drugs led to his early death at age 60 in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d469fd3dc46b9cbf263e363a15ce4710ed1a74","amp;dn":"John+Martyn+-+Back+Down+My+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d469fd3dc46b9cbf263e363a15ce4710ed1a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,212,105,253,61,196,107,156,191,38,62,54,58,21,206,71,16,237,26,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
