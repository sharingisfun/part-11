This text uses an abundance of real data in the exercises and examples, and minimizes computation, so that readers can focus on the statistical concepts and issues, not the mathematics. Basic algebra is assumed as a prerequisite.\nFrom the Publisher\nThe style of Statistics for the Life Sciences is informal and uses only minimal mathematical notation. There are no prerequisites except elementary algebra; anyone who can read a biology or chemistry textbook can read this text. It is suitable for use by graduate or undergraduate students in biology, agronomy, medical and health sciences, nutrition, pharmacy, animal science, physical education, forestry and other life sciences. Look for a new edition in 1999. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 672 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 4 edition (January 6, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321652800\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321652805","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:659e7e6a1fd4c08c57c7f2fb0de56014604b138a","amp;dn":"Statistics+for+the+Life+Sciences+%2C4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"659e7e6a1fd4c08c57c7f2fb0de56014604b138a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,158,126,106,31,212,192,140,87,199,242,251,13,229,96,20,96,75,19,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
