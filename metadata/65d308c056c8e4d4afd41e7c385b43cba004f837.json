For us, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little bit bigger than the rest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for one, the regular readers of the magazine will agree that the pages of FHM donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pander to the almost school girl crush on cricket. We like football. We also like staying up late and beer. Which is why the World Cup might not be our mecca, Promised Land and all that, but its still a big deal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bigger than at least IPL. Turn to page 47 for our mammoth 20-page World Cup special. World Cup special. We will also be setting up a special section on our website fhmindia.com/worldcup2014. Plus this time,  we can relate to the World Cup a little bit more than normal. For one the Brazilian approach to the World Cup has been eerily similar to our very own approach to the Commonwealth.\n\nMagazine Description: \n\nFHM India - India's most talked about men's magazine as well as the world's largest men's lifestyle magazine which boasts of a strong, socially relevant, irreverent editorial.
