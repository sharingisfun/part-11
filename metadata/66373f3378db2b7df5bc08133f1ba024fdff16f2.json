Gorgeous melodies, with young people experimenting sex being a prevailing theme throughout the album. Every track after Joyriders is superb, the obvious highlights are Babies and Do you remember the first time for first timers, but I bet they won't be your favourite tracks after a few listens. Many songs seems to take your imagination for a ride each time you hear them; it's difficult to put into words, but I know that some people out there will know exactly what I mean. An absolute brilliant classic.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 61\nArtist: Pulp\nAlbum: His 'N' Hers\nYear: 1994\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66373f3378db2b7df5bc08133f1ba024fdff16f2","amp;dn":"Pulp+-+His+%5C%27n%5C%27+Hers+%5BFLAC-1994%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66373f3378db2b7df5bc08133f1ba024fdff16f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,55,63,51,120,219,43,125,245,188,8,19,63,27,160,36,253,255,22,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
