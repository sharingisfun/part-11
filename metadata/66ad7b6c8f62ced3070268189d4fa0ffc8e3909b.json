I haven't seen any book that I consider to be its equal. . . . It serves as a gold standard for introductory level statistics books. I particularly like the inclusion in this edition of the introductory section and the summary at the end of the chapter. The review questions included in the new 5th edition are excellent [ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦] a substantial improvement over the current 4th edition&quot;\n\nJoan Michael, North Carolina State University: &quot;I would consider the Kirk text to be superior to other texts which I have considered for adoption. I really appreciate the thoroughness of coverage.&quot;\n\nProduct Description:\nMaster Teacher and writer Roger E. Kirk brings two clear goals to the Fifth Edition of STATISTICS: AN INTRODUCTION: to provide a sound introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics and to help students read and understand statistical presentations in their field. Kirk provides guidelines to help you decide when to use various procedures, and how to understand the logic of the procedures. This revision includes a complete update, focusing specifically on increased coverage of effect size and power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66ad7b6c8f62ced3070268189d4fa0ffc8e3909b","amp;dn":"Statistics%3A+An+Introduction+%285e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66ad7b6c8f62ced3070268189d4fa0ffc8e3909b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,173,123,108,143,98,206,211,7,2,104,24,157,79,160,255,200,227,144,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
