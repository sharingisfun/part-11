Haunted by a disturbing childhood incidentÃ¢â‚¬â€and driven by her demonsÃ¢â‚¬â€Claire has always been drawn to those rare &quot;untreatable&quot; patients who seem to have no conscience or fear. But one shocking case could make or break her career...and it's waiting for her in the psychiatric wing of New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rikers Island.\n\nHis name is Quimby. A deranged inmate whose boyish good looks hide a sordid history of dysfunction and abuse, Quimby triggers something in Claire she'd rather not face. As she tries to unlock QuimbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, she unwittingly reveals her own painful secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€leaving herself dangerously vulnerable. When the case propels her into the mind of another killerÃ¢â‚¬â€a homocidal maniac who's watching her every moveÃ¢â‚¬â€it could only end in madness, murder, or both...\n\nBrilliantly constructed and breathtakingly suspenseful, Kill Switch is a masterful combination of murder, mystery, and modern forensics that will keep you turning the pages to the final shocking conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c3416d0a78a48b0edafb78999eb3c5e6b9eda9","amp;dn":"Neal+Baer+-+Kill+switch+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c3416d0a78a48b0edafb78999eb3c5e6b9eda9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,195,65,109,10,120,164,139,14,218,251,120,153,158,179,197,230,185,237,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
