Like other Vertigo titles in the 90's and beyond (such as Neil Gaiman's Sandman or Alan Moore's Animal Man), this comic became and intelligent and thought-provoking series for mature readers as well as a feast for the eyes. It certainly remains a fascinating and thoroughly intriguing vision and now with these new digital releases there is no better time to check it out! Thanks to Empire for the scans, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c92348ad611998c80b57eb427f0c833e2a0ce1","amp;dn":"Shade%2C+The+Changing+Man+v2+01-70+%281990-1996%2C+Dgtl-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c92348ad611998c80b57eb427f0c833e2a0ce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,201,35,72,173,97,25,152,200,11,87,235,66,127,12,131,62,42,12,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
