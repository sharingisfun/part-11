Gerhard often found himself in strange or awkward predicaments such as being kidnapped by militants, becoming the victim of organ bandits, and being viciously attacked by Bigfoot.\n\nThere is a fairly large online fanbase left from the show, due mostly to late night re-runs. There have been many online petitions to either put the show back on the air or at least release a DVD.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nThis show is a real hoot. Enjoy.\n\nFrom --==( epiCURean )==--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670bf32dd8ba229aa9dada55d4669584a9378351","amp;dn":"Gerhard+Reinke%5C%27s+Wanderlust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670bf32dd8ba229aa9dada55d4669584a9378351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,11,243,45,216,186,34,154,169,218,218,85,212,102,149,132,169,55,131,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
