Taking over two hours to perform, the 4000 measure score was found among some forgotten manuscripts by Andrew Homzy in 1989 (ten years after Mingus' death) and reconstructed with the help of Mingus' widow, Sue Mingus. Supposedly named &quot;Epitaph&quot; by Mingus referring to it being way too complex and ambitious to ever be successfully played and therefore he would be taking it to the grave, Homzy and Sue were determined to have his epitaph come to live. That same year orchestra conductor Gunther Schuller was given the task to assemble the musicians and lead them in the performance of the gargantuan piece. This proved to be a tough challenge given its complexity, but they finally came through triumphantly in the concert at Alice Tully Hall in New York's Lincoln Centre. The next year the performance of &quot;Epitaph&quot; was released as a live album that you can now find in this torrent at mp3 320 kbps quality.\n\n\nHope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67b9a704ea5fc8812cedae4127928bd2a2c28ef7","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+-+Epitaph+1990+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67b9a704ea5fc8812cedae4127928bd2a2c28ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,185,167,4,234,95,200,129,44,237,174,65,39,146,139,210,162,194,142,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
