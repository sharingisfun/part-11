Now, he's staring down the barrel of a gun, pursued by two of the world's most dangerous men. To get out, he'll have to do all the things he thought he'd never do again: lie, cheat, steal-and this time, maybe even kill.\n\nMike grew up in a world of small-stakes con men, learning lessons at his father's knee. His hard-won success in college and law school was his ticket out. As the Davies Group's rising star, he rubs shoulders with &quot;The 500,&quot; the elite men and women who really run Washington -- and the world. But peddling influence, he soon learns, is familiar work: even with a pedigree, a con is still a con.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67dc279128fdc3ac32601c2ef40741ea58483d61","amp;dn":"The+500%3A+A+Novel+by+Matthew+Quirk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67dc279128fdc3ac32601c2ef40741ea58483d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,220,39,145,40,253,195,172,50,96,28,46,244,7,65,234,88,72,61,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
