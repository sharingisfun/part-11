Active in the United States after 1934, his intellectual concerns were the dehumanizing effects of capitalism and modern technology.\r\n\r\nBetween 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US Government Service, which helped form the basis of his book SOVIET MARXISM (1958).  His scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the U.S. and internationally, and he became known as the preeminent theorist of the New Left.  Among his best known works are REASON AND REVOLUTION (1940), a dialectical study of Hegel and Marx; EROS AND CIVILIZATION (1955), an attempt to synthesize the theories of Marx and Freud; and ONE-DIMENSIONAL MAN (1964), documenting the rise of new forms of social repression  in both the West and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\r\n\r\n* THE AESTHETIC DIMENSION: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics (Beacon, 1978).
