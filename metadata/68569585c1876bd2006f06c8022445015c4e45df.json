This DVD features music videos for 15 of Michael Jackson's top hits.\n\nPop king Michael Jackson solidifies his title with this release of fifteen past number one hits Michael Jackson - Number Ones video. Songs include &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,&quot; &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;Black or White,&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Dancefloor.&quot; Michael Jackson - Number Ones film.\n\n[i]Like the Beatles and Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson is one of the handful of artists that can release an album of their number one singles. Number Ones includes his solo chart toppers in the UK and abroad from the period beginning with his Off the Wall album right up to the new song &quot;One More Chance&quot;, a collaboration with R Kelly. The remaining 17 songs on the album are all classics drawn from the disco-soul Off the Wall, the funky Thriller, the good Bad, the safe Dangerous, the semi-best-of History and the weak Invincible. Regardless of whether the bulk of Number Ones has appeared on other greatest hits albums, this is still an incredible selection of Michael Jackson's best music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/410vGOdnOL_zps2f8a7acc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/410vGOdnOL_zps2f8a7acc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack Listings\n1.

This set omits the songs &quot;She's Out of My Life&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; and &quot;Remember The Time&quot; that appeared on the 2001 greatest hits disc but adds 8 (!) other hits. &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Earth Song&quot;, &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, his newest song &quot;One More Chance&quot; and the concert version of &quot;Ben&quot; from The Jacksons live album. Although there are some number one hits still omitted, this CD is the more complete of the two. As a bonus, the songs are presented in chronological order this time too.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/Michael_Jackson_Number_Ones_R1_CD-cdcovers_cc-cd1_zpsea2e9fdc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/Michael_Jackson_Number_Ones_R1_CD-cdcovers_cc-cd1_zpsea2e9fdc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe CD has been released in four different covers representing separate eras of his solo career. Who knows which one Amazon will ship, but the cover pictured is my favorite. Don't worry about not getting your favorite cover though as all are included in the bookelt. Which brings me to the only downside to this collection - the skimpy liner notes. Every greatest hits colection should list release date and chart information. Not all of these songs were number one hits in the U.S. It would be nice to know where it hit number one and how long it held the position.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/4d921363ada0d98aa21df010L_zpsf413029a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/4d921363ada0d98aa21df010L_zpsf413029a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMJ fans probably already have all 6 of his CD's and therefore the main reason to get this CD is for the new song &quot;One More Chance&quot; which is classic MJ R&amp;B. If you only have one or two of his CD's then NUMBER ONES will be a perfect addition to your collection. Highly recommended.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/be6e419328a0c589a218e110L_zpsd9a01a47.jpg[&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Michael%20Jackson/Number%20Ones/be6e419328a0c589a218e110L_zpsd9a01a47.jpg[&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68569585c1876bd2006f06c8022445015c4e45df","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-Number+Ones-+%3DVideo+Compilation%3D+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68569585c1876bd2006f06c8022445015c4e45df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,86,149,133,193,135,107,210,0,111,6,200,2,36,69,1,92,78,69,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
