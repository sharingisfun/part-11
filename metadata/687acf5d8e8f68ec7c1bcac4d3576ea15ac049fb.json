The two veterans, who had worked together previously, are joined by drummer Phillipe Combelle during the two 1962 sessions recorded at Les Trois Mailletz, complete with a typically out of tune piano and a fair amount of noise from the audience at times. The pianist's gruff voice dominates a fair amount of the performances, although most of the songs are Dixon's. The bassist steals the show during the opener, &quot;Rocking and Rolling the House,&quot; with a fine solo. In fact, the only standard not written by either man is a campy miniature take of Big Bill Broonzy's &quot;All by Myself.&quot; Blues fans will want up to pick up this live recording by two legendary musicians.
