It is used to create, import,           \n      edit, query, map, analyze, and publish geographic information.         \n      There are four products in the ArcGIS Desktop collection; each         \n      adds a higher level of functionality.                                  \n                                                                             \n      All ArcGIS Desktop products share a common architecture, so            \n      users working with any of these GIS desktops can share their           \n      work with others. Maps, data, symbology, map layers,                   \n      geoprocessing models, custom tools and interfaces, reports,            \n      metadata, and so on, can be accessed interchangeably. This             \n      means that all GIS users in an organization can benefit from           \n      using a single, consistent user interface and set of                   \n      functionality and data formats, thus minimizing the need to            \n      learn and deploy several different products.                           \n                                                                                                                                              \n      More info can be found @                                               \n      http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688acdcc294452f270772428c7373e986445d93d","amp;dn":"ESRI+ArcGIS+Desktop+9.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688acdcc294452f270772428c7373e986445d93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,138,205,204,41,68,82,242,112,119,36,40,199,55,62,152,100,69,217,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
