Free mp3 download came with album purchase, so I thought I'd share.\n\nFrom the sleeve: &quot;In a milieu in which glam rock residue was abundant, the Urinals were as nudely uncostumed as the beach punk bands that would gush along in their wake. The Urinals evinced similar disdain for standard song formulae. Their best tunes were small, jagged shards busted out of some unwritten whole. At the time comparable only to early Wire, their songs were short enough and monochromatic enough to seem utterly unresolved the first time you heard them. One riff per song was often enough, one vocal line could suffice. While the Urinals compositions sometimes offered more than these basics, the material frequently seemed pared down to absolute minimum number of elements required for them to exist as verifiable 'songs.' Many others subsequently used the same technique: San Pedro's Minutemen, Boston's Mission of Burma, Dunedin's The Clean and even Aberdeen's N******. Indeed, the Urinals played a crudely refined brand of avant-garage art-punk at a time when most youngsters were still trying to figure out the chords to 'Neat Neat Neat.'&quot; (Byron Coley)\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Urinals (1978)\n1.
