The status of being a legend is reserved for the chosen few who believe they are destined for greatness. \n\nAchieving success is your ability to eliminate the weaknesses and biases that are inherent within yourself. History tells us that not all greats have off-the-chart IQs, nor are they born with limitless freedom. In fact, it is this triumph over less than favorable circumstances and their determination to achieve that we tend to respect the most. The people who have changed the world are people like you and I. They set out to achieve outstanding results and make their decisions within intellectual criteria. All the greats have engaged a higher impulse, a higher bandwidth, and an inherent strength. [Pg. 43, The Jetstream of Success]\n\nAuthor, Julian Pencilliah, lives by five rules daily: \n\nÃ‚Â·Believe with an extravagance\nÃ‚Â·Think with a sophistication\nÃ‚Â·Exceed probability amplitudes\nÃ‚Â·Smile with Radiance\nÃ‚Â·Get Lucky\nThe Jetstream of Success is a book filled with crystallized wisdom and intellectual processes that is meant to help the reader become more sophisticated in their thinking. \n\nAs powerful as the lessons are, they required context; a sense of connection with the reader. It is for this reason the author takes you on a journey across the world to live through his real life experiences to serve as analogies that unveil the potential within you. \n\nThe chapters are filled with entertainment that is delivered through the richest writing and locations around the world. Whether it's going face-to-face with a great white shark in the depths of the Atlantic, dancing the samba at the Rio Carnival or being on a game drive with Virgin billionaire Sir Richard Branson, every single chapter will keep you captivated and completely engrossed. \n\nThe Jetstream of Success has been written to help the reader to reinvent themselves more conducive to their goals. The book was not intended to be an easy read. In fact, it was designed to challenge the reader to take a leap of vision and piece together an ever-fuller understanding of themselves so they can redefine their lives and as a result, their futures. \n\n&quot;The book is based on the realization that the richest awakening of yourself will unveil life's deepest mysteries&quot; -  Julian Pencilliah \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6999b776f5a87d9711c5fcd9dab2dc6723bd501c","amp;dn":"The+Jetstream+of+Success+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6999b776f5a87d9711c5fcd9dab2dc6723bd501c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,153,183,118,245,168,125,151,17,197,252,217,218,178,220,103,35,189,80,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
