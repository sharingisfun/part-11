The first three discs contain remastered versions (excellent sound), alternate takes, non-lp tracks and unissued tracks from their career. The fourth disc contains alternate versions and unissued tracks from their live album. The last disc summarizes the solo career of the members of the band. The booklet is excellent with many pictures, chart information and other useful information about the band. Free was unjustly overshadowed by bluesy vocalist Paul Rodgers' and drummer Simon Kirke's later band Bad Company. I find this band much more interesting. While the material is less commercial than their later work with Bad Company, this material is delivered with more feeling. The late guitarist Paul Kossoff with his impressive blues laden vibrato attack was highly influential. Ex-John Mayall bass player Andy Fraser was an excellent musician, witness &quot;Mr. Big&quot; for an example. This song along with the anthem &quot;All Right Now&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot; are probably the band's most requested songs. Some of my favorites include &quot;I'll Be Creepin'&quot;, &quot;Broad Daylight&quot;, &quot;The Stealer&quot;, and &quot;Little Bit Of Love&quot; among many others. Free was reportedly a big influence on Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band pretty much burned out with the departures of Paul Kossoff and Rodgers' song writing partner Andy Fraser. One album was released after they departed. The band played such festivals as the Isle Of Wight during their halcyon days.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. Over The Green Hills\n02.
