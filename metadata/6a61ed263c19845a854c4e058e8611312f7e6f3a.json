Maureen O'Hara, Macdonald Carey, Binnie Barnes\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046979/\r\n\r\n\r\nFilmed at MÃ¡laga, AndalucÃ­a, Spain\r\n\r\nJoanna Dane, a former OSS operator (forerunner of the CIA), is sent to Tangier by the American authorities to find out who is behind a powerful ring of smugglers that does a booming business in contraband with counterparts in Spain and Italy, and who also contribute to the high death rate among Tangier policemen. Dane is adept at jiu jitsu, firearms, and wisecracks that she uses on anyone who tangles with her. She gets work in a waterfront dive owned by &quot;Frisco&quot; and is soon being courted by smuggler Van Logan. Most of the action is set in Tangier, with a brief interlude in Spanish Gibraltar, and the climax takes place on the North African shore of the Mediterranean. Peter Sellers dubbed at least six actors in the cast without credit with one account listing fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 25.000 fps, 1310 Kbps, 01h17m23s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nTVRip brief station banner, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/64na26ixj/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/hxe73sdav/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/wkf5lgbx3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6mbjff6fr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/smrvw1p3r/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a61ed263c19845a854c4e058e8611312f7e6f3a","amp;dn":"Malaga+-+Fire+Over+Africa+%5B1954+-+UK%5D+crime+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a61ed263c19845a854c4e058e8611312f7e6f3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,97,237,38,60,25,132,90,133,76,78,5,142,134,17,49,47,126,111,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
