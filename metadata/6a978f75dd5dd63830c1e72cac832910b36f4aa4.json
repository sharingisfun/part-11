It was released in the United States on CD in 2005 and is the first recording of Davis in Japan. It is the only album to showcase an early incarnation of his Second Great Quintet featuring Sam Rivers on tenor saxophone, following George Coleman's departure; after this, Wayne Shorter's appointment would complete the classic lineup which would go on to record such albums as ESP, Nefertiti and Miles Smiles, through to Miles in the Sky.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n2005 Reissue\n\n    &quot;Introduction by Teruo Isono&quot; - 1:10\n    &quot;If I Were a Bell&quot; (Frank Loesser) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:14\n    &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12:45\n    &quot;So What&quot; (Miles Davis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:02\n    &quot;Walkin'&quot; (Richard H.
