The film was produced by Laurel Legler and directed by David C. Thomas; the couple spent more than seven years working on the project. The release on the video has been held up after many, MANY legal problems, and as of 2012, MC5: A True Testimonial has not been officially released on DVD.\n\nAlthough the MC5 are considered very influential today, they were relatively obscure in their time. To make the film, Thomas collected photographs and film clips of varying quality, including U.S. government surveillance footage of the MC5's performance at the protests that took place outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He interviewed the surviving members of the band and people closely associated with it. In the editing room, Thomas matched the band's recordings to the silent footage he had collected. MC5: A True Testimonial made its premiere on August 22, 2002, at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Three weeks later it made its international premiere on September 11 at the Toronto International Film Festival. In November of that year, the film was awarded an &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; as a debut feature at the Raindance Film Festival. During 2003 and early 2004, the film was shown at film festivals around the world.\n\nDVD info\n\nRelease Date: Withdrawn\nStudio: Avatar Films\nOriginal format: DVD9\nLimited Release in 2004 (300 copies)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa94def1ac03b8db4986a9338c9f863b640f234","amp;dn":"MC5%3A+A+True+Testimonial+%282002%29+DVD9+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa94def1ac03b8db4986a9338c9f863b640f234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,169,77,239,26,192,59,141,180,152,106,147,56,201,248,99,182,64,242,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
