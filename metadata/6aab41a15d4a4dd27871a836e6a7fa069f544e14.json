He was a member of two music groups Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Virginians and, later, The Good Earth Ã¢â‚¬â€ and was then known as Bill Swofford.\n\nHis clean-cut good looks and soaring tenor voice were the perfect vehicle for the uptempo single entitled &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; from the pop/rock musical &quot;Hair,&quot; which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1969, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. a month later.[1] Later that fall, a softer, ballad single entitled &quot;Jean&quot; (the theme from the Oscar-winning film The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie) bested his previous effort by one, reaching #2 on the Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. Written by longtime beatnik poet Rod McKuen, &quot;Jean&quot; also sold over one million copies, garnering Oliver his second gold disc in as many months.[1] Performing both hits on a number of TV variety shows and specials in the late 1960s, including The Ed Sullivan Show, helped both songs.\n\nOliver had more modest commercial success, however, with the cover of &quot;Sunday Mornin',&quot; which peaked at #35 in December 1969, and &quot;Angelica,&quot; which stalled at #97 four months later. In addition, his cover of &quot;I Can Remember,&quot; the 1968 James &amp; Bobby Purify hit, missed the Hot 100 but climbed into the top 25 of the Billboard Easy Listening chart in the mid summer of 1970.[2] Late that fall, Oliver also had one inspirational recording entitled &quot;Light the Way,&quot; composed by Eric Carmen. Oliver's last single to enter the pop music charts was his 1971 cover of &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot; by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot. The song &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; at #124 on May 1, 1971 and also reached #38 the Easy Listening chart a few weeks later.\n\n\n\nFirst LP\n\n320 Kbps (CBR)\n\nVynil Rip\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aab41a15d4a4dd27871a836e6a7fa069f544e14","amp;dn":"Oliver+-+Good+Morning+Starshine+%5BVynil+Rip+%40+320+Kbps%5D%5Bcovers+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aab41a15d4a4dd27871a836e6a7fa069f544e14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,171,65,161,93,74,77,210,120,113,168,54,230,167,250,6,159,84,78,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
