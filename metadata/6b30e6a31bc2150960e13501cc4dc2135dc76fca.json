The songs included offer a startling range of styles, subject matter, and themes, but all share a kind of quiet celebration of the mature Van, able to sing, play and even chant his way through a song like no one else can. Indeed, after a string of disappointing albums that did not gain wide recognition or playtime, this album reestablished Morrison as a star of the first magnitude. So, we find the eclectic star of &quot;Them&quot; and then the guy who sang everything from &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; to &quot;Moondance&quot; waxing sentimental here about love, dawn drives through the country, and God.\n\nFrom the smash hit opener of &quot;Whenever God Shines His Light&quot;, sung with British rock icon Cliff Richard, to the thoughtful and pensive &quot;Coney Island&quot;, Van shows why he is such an enduring presence in the contemporary pop music scene. Diffidently intelligent, Morrison muses about the strains of contemporary culture in &quot;I'm Tired, Joey Boy&quot;, and waxes eloquently about his re-found Christian faith in &quot;When Will I Ever Learn To Live In God?&quot;, which is also my personal favorite here. Also noteworthy are &quot;Orangefield&quot;, &quot;These Are The Days&quot;, and a smashing rendition of &quot;Daring Night&quot;. In fact, I really like all of the cuts here, but have to admit I still like the long-time hit garnered here with &quot;Have I Told you Lately&quot;, which Van admitted was a self-conscious effort to emulate the work of Frank Sinatra with an out-and-out love song. This album is a keeper, and one you are sure to enjoy. I still do!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVan Morrison - Avalon Sunset\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nArtist...............: Van Morrison\nAlbum................: Avalon Sunset\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 55 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 254kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
