Although neither as critically or commercially successful as the Clash, Big Audio Dynamite&amp;#039;s blend of rock and dance music, with a generous dose of samples, was a fixture on college radio in the mid- to late &amp;#039;80s with tracks like &quot;E=MC2,&quot; &quot;The Bottom Line,&quot; and &quot;C&amp;#039;mon Every Beatbox&quot; (all included here). The band even managed to make a foray onto the U.S. Top 40 charts in 1992 with the infectious &quot;Rush.&quot; With his place already secure in rock annals, Jones&amp;#039; work with BAD was much more lighthearted, but it cannily anticipated the influence electronics and technology would have on music. Despite the dated feel of some of Planet BAD, it&amp;#039;s also undeniable that the band was a more interesting venture than it was sometimes given credit. (AMG)\n\n\n01.
