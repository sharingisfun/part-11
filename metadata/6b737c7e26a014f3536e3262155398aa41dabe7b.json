ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rollercoaster ride that at times feels like that line from Taylor SwiftÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ i.e., Ã¢â‚¬Å“I say Ã¢â‚¬ËœI hate you,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ we break up, you call me, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI love you.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fortunately, ArmigerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way with words is more debonair.\n\nThe singer helped write each track, but not all come from her personal experiences. She describes the album as the diary of her last two years, but some of the stories are borrowed from close friends. In fact, many of the highlights find the singer one step removed from the action.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna ChangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a song about someone a friend dated. The song opens the album and sets the bar high for the 13 tracks that follow. Producer Chad Carlson is at his best when working with Armiger to give her polished pop sound just the slightest bit of edge.\n\nThe chorus is one fans will delight having burrowed between their ears:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna change / When that sun up in the sky starts pouring rain / When the stars come out in the middle of the day / And the oceans turn to dust, go on and pray,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the 21-year-old sings.\n\nThere isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a moment on Ã¢â‚¬ËœFall Into MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when Armiger tries to outthink her all too familiar emotions. She strings stories together in a pleasant way without finding it necessary to cram them with complex poetry. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking about,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said no one ever when speaking about a Katie Armiger song. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a compliment and a statement to her credibility as a mainstream country artist.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœPlayinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ With FireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBetter in a Black Dress,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ are two others that find an edge to separate this singer from the rest of country music. A few never get there. The intensely personal Ã¢â‚¬ËœMan I Thought You WereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is well-written, but as a vocalist, Armiger blends in like Coffee-Mate. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack and WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ finds her struggling with whether to split from a lover. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most traditional arrangement on this record, with the banjo and steel guitar taking center stage around a flat story.\n\nWith 14 songs, there are bound to be a few dull spots on Ã¢â‚¬ËœFall Into Me.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too many for an album that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t include much variance in the topics, and by the time the rollercoaster goes back up and down on Ã¢â‚¬ËœNot Too LateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSo Long,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ one could find themselves looking to hop off.\n\nThere are gems after the halfway point Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬ËœCardboard BoxesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the sneaky, clever wraparound type song that radio loves Ã¢â‚¬â€ and many will appreciate the overwhelming sense of optimism the singer retains despite her struggles. Armiger should be proud of this effort because more than anything else, it defines her sound in the minds of fans Ã¢â‚¬â€ and more importantly, those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know her previously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b737c7e26a014f3536e3262155398aa41dabe7b","amp;dn":"Katie+Armiger+-+Fall+Into+Me+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b737c7e26a014f3536e3262155398aa41dabe7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,115,124,126,38,160,20,243,83,110,50,98,21,83,152,170,65,218,190,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
