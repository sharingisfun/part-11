When the relatives gather for the reading of the will, his spinster sister Agnes (Fay Compton) learns she must earn her living for a month as a maid; rakish playboy Simon (Guy Middleton) must marry the first girl he meets; meek bank clerk Herbert (George Cole) must try and hold-up his bank and retired army officer/ novelist Deniston (Alastair Sim) must commit a petty crime and spend a month in jail. A deftly executed and splendidly acted affair from prodigious director-producer Mario Zampi (Too Many Crooks), the film also skewers the human capacity for avarice and greed.\n\nFeature Running Time: 92 mins Approx Feature Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1\n&quot;LAUGHTER IN PARADISE&quot; STARRING ALASTAIR SIM GEORGE COLE\nINTRODUCING FAY COMPTON HUGH BURDEN JOYCE GRENFELL AUDREY HEPBURN\nPRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY MARIO ZAMPI\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© I951 TRANSOCEAN FILMS LTD.
