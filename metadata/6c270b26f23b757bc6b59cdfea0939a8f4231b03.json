A very personal story that is both funny and poignant, TORCH SONG TRILOGY chronicles a New Yorker's search for love, respect and tradition in a world that seems not especially made for him. From Arnold's hilarious steps toward domestic bliss with a reluctant school teacher, to his first truly promising love affair with a young fashion model, Arnold's greatest challenge remains his complicated relationship with his mother. But armed with a keenly developed sense of humor and oftentimes piercing wit, Arnold continues to test the commonly accepted terms of endearment--and endurance--in a universally affecting story that confirms that happiness is well worth carrying a torch for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c270b26f23b757bc6b59cdfea0939a8f4231b03","amp;dn":"TORCH_SONG_TRILOGY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c270b26f23b757bc6b59cdfea0939a8f4231b03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,39,11,38,242,59,117,123,198,181,156,223,234,9,57,168,244,35,27,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
