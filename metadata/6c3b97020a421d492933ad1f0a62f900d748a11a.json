Events of this crossover would affect all three books for years as well as leading directly in the X-Men v1 01, which featured the return of Magneto as well as his new Acolytes. Every issue is digital thanks to Minutemen-Phantasm. Please seed, and enjoy - I have plenty more X-Men posts to come! :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3b97020a421d492933ad1f0a62f900d748a11a","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+X-Tinction+Agenda+%281990-1991.+Dgtl%2C+Minutemen-Phantasm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3b97020a421d492933ad1f0a62f900d748a11a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,59,151,2,10,66,29,73,41,51,173,31,10,98,249,0,215,72,161,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
