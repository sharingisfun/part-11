Alfred Hitchcock liked to torture ice queens (Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Tippi Hedren), while Luis Bunuel, the master surrealist, subverted everyday reality with bizarre and disturbing imagery, like a sleeper returning to a familiar dream (or nightmare).\n\nScriptwriter-turned-director Yoshihiro Nakamura likes plots where the facade of ordinary reality begins to crack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or dissolve altogether, with the heroes forced to deal with the often unpleasant consequences.\n\nThe obnoxious late-night DJ of Nakamura's horror film &quot;Booth&quot; (2005) is taking calls from listeners when the voice of his dead lover comes over the wires, calling him a liar. The 14-year-old heroine of the same director's &quot;Route 225&quot; (2006) and her pudgy kid brother are walking home from the park when they find themselves not only lost in their own neighborhood, but trapped in another dimension.\n\nThe story of his latest film, the oddly but aptly titled &quot;Ahiru to Kamo no Coin Locker (The Coin Locker of the Duck and Drake),&quot; fits his things-are-not-what-they-seem pattern, but with a twist: The hero ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the audience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ do not find out how strange the film's world truly is until well into the third act, but the clues are there to see from the beginning. In other words, I have to be careful in describing the story for fear of giving the game away.\n\nIt's clever, this story, in a way familiar from such scriptwriter favorites as Christopher Nolan's &quot;Memento&quot; and David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ films that subvert conventional narrative expectations at every turn, with an internal logic (or in Lynch's case, illogic) that spells confusion to the more literal-minded, but perfection to fans.\n\nAt the same time, Nakamura's use of a Bunuelian device ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ two actors in the same role ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is less successful, since he is less clear about his rationale (beyond a desire to mess with the audience's mind) than the more artful Bunuel, who used double casting to brilliantly illustrate his heroine's duality (among much else) in &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire.&quot; To use a favorite scriptwriter phrase, Nakamura takes the audience out of the picture. Devotees of trick plots may not mind, while those who prefer to dance with the one that brought them may feel jilted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or simply baffled.\n\nNakamura, who also wrote the script from an eponymous novel written by Kotari Isaka, is trying to, not just mess with his audience's mind, but inject the sort of Buddhistic message that would never have occurred to the atheistic Bunuel: People have the power to change ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the next life if not this one.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard01-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard01-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard02.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard02.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard03.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard03.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard04.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard04.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard05.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard05.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard06.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard06.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard07.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard07.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------my rip-------\n\n~~~~~~ Ahiru to kamo no koinrokka.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                              \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,258,999,808                     \n                                                                           \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:49:56                \nFrame Count:....................................158128             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................592                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................320                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.850                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1325                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.292&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
