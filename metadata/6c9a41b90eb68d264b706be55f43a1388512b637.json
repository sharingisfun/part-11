I must confess, when I started out I had the attitude that you can\\'t take the advice of a female on how to push their buttons. I now feel the opposite. The most valuable information that I learned about women is from women themselves.\nIf you are looking for a bunch of routines or cheesey pick-up lines, then this book will surely disappoint you. What this book did for me was fill in a lot of missing pieces of the puzzle. Kezia provides the groundwork on how to make a positive impact on women that get hit on by guys all day long\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n\n\nPS: If you have an ORIGINAL (non \\&quot;for dummies\\&quot;) E-book request Feel free to post\nit below.
