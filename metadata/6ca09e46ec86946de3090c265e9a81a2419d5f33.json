Rich in content and full of surprises, this powerful talk reveals hidden treasures which will change your life and bring you closer to Jesus the very next time you receive Holy Communion. Perfect for a variety of parish programs.\n\n---\n\nVinny Flynn is the founder of Mercysong Ministries and is known to many as the man who sings the Divine Mercy Chaplet on EWTN. Along with his wife Donna, he has been serving the Church in active ministry for over thirty years through teaching, writing, retreats, speaking, counseling, and music. This CD is based on his new book from Ignatius Press, 7 Secrets of the Eucharist, and is the fruit of a lifetime of research and prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. Described as &quot;a real gem&quot; and &quot;must reading for any Catholic&quot; by Cardinal George Pell, Vinny's book is available directly from Mercysong.com. \n\nMore about Seven Secrets of the Eucharist:\n\nThis is the first Mary Foundation CD based on a book. Pope John Paul II referred to the Holy Eucharist as &quot;the greatest treasure of the Church,&quot; and yet most practicing Catholics have received very little in-depth or inspirational theological insight about this critical aspect of our spiritual lives since our school days.\n\nMr. Flynn's &quot;secrets&quot; are actually a series of surprising principles, insights, and &quot;hidden&quot; truths, presented together for the first time in one exciting talk. All seven secrets are based on truths found in the Bible, the writings of the Saints, the Catechism, and recent teachings of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. These truths have always been embraced by the saints, Church Fathers, theologians, and mystics, but have never before been presented together, and rarely in such a meaningful and accessible way. This CD also includes two &quot;bonus secrets&quot; about Our Lady's relationship to the Eucharist which are not found in Vinny Flynn's book.\n\nVinny Flynn will show you how reception of the Eucharist can be a life-changing experience the very next time you receive Holy Communion.\n\nORDER YOUR FREE CD COPIES ONLINE NOW &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.catholicity.com/cds/secrets.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.catholicity.com/cds/secrets.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nCatholiCity runs a large deficit each year because they give away free life-changing Catholic CDs, booklets and novels.
