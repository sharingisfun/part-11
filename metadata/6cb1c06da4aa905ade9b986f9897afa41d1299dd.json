There is a very nice Dolby 5.1 version and that would be awesome. Big Papi has not checked to see if it is available though. Feel free to leave a comment if you find it.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nBeth Cholette VINE VOICE\nAnyone familiar with 80s music will recognize the soulful, expressive sounds of Crowded House from some of this album's biggest hits, including &quot;Don't Dream It's Over,&quot; &quot;Something So Strong,&quot; and &quot;Now We're Getting Somewhere.&quot; These popular tunes accurately represent the entire album, whose songs range from pop-like tracks with catchy lyrics (&quot;World Where You Live&quot;) to tracks with a similar beat but a more moody feel (&quot;Mean to Me&quot;). If you've ever purchased an album for 1-2 songs only to find out that the rest of the album was totally different, this will NOT be your experience with Crowded House, as the band's sound is very consistant throughout. Furthermore, although Crowded House experienced little fame beyond the 80s, their music still feels thoroughly fresh and modern. If you don't yet have any Crowded House in your 80s music collection, this album is a must-have.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCrowded House - Crowded House\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Crowded House\nAlbum................: Crowded House\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1986\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 259kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
