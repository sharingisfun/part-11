The result was 1973's sprawling GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, a record that mixed genres and sounds with ease and spawned hit singles such as &quot;Bennie and the Jets,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting,&quot; and &quot;Candle in the Wind.&quot; This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series uses interviews with Sir Elton and his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, archival footage of the demo sessions, and rare live performances to tell the story behind the canonical album.\n\n[u]DVD5 Full Menu'\n\nnessuna compressione[/u]\n\n[IMG]http://uptiki.com/images/h5df2vbyv5o0vno0mhk.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[URL=http://uptiki.com/viewer.php?file=y4xicgvphgcxdku1sbq.jpg][IMG]http://uptiki.com/images/y4xicgvphgcxdku1sbq_thumb.jpg[/IMG][/URL] \n\n [URL=http://uptiki.com/viewer.php?file=i9i3a270sfizdaaw6gy0.jpg][IMG]http://uptiki.com/images/i9i3a270sfizdaaw6gy0_thumb.jpg[/IMG][/URL]  [URL=http://uptiki.com/viewer.php?file=16whq7ij7dx6wdm52x.jpg][IMG]http://uptiki.com/images/16whq7ij7dx6wdm52x_thumb.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[IMG]http://img856.imageshack.us/img856/9001/seedtosto2.gif[/IMG]\n\n[/i][/b][/center][/color]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc6c173aa02aa294573d30c740a56871c8dae1c","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road+%282001%29+%5BDVD5+Full+-+Eng+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc6c173aa02aa294573d30c740a56871c8dae1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,198,193,115,170,2,170,41,69,115,211,12,116,10,86,135,28,141,174,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
