YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get hands-on experience working with Objective-C and Xcode 4 as you work through this tutorial-style book with two experienced iOS developers by your side. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the fundamentals of maintainable, performant iOS programming, including:\n\n- Making apps that are internationalizable, testable, multi-core-capable, and that use less memory.\n- Understanding the underlying concepts of touch event handling, drawing and animation, multi-core concurrency, and memory management with iOSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Automatic Reference Counting.\n- Developing user interfaces with Auto Layout that take advantage of the extra screen space on the iPhone 5.\n- Creating and using unit tests to ensure your app continues to work as intended even as the codebase evolves.\n- Working through AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s App Store processes, including preparing apps for submission, avoiding rejections, and understanding crash reports from end users.\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a first-time iOS developer, or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to get up to speed with all the changes to AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tools and frameworks, iOS SDK Development is the solid grounding you need to master this popular platform.\n\nWhat you need\nYou need a Mac running Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and Xcode 4.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
