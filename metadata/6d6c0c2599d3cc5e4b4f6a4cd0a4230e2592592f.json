Enjoy!\n\nFall Out Boy recently spoke to Billboard about their new album, Infinity On\nHigh. The record is the follow up to their multi-platinum major label debut,\nFrom Under The Cork Tree. Guitarist Patrick Stump explained: From song to song\nthere&amp;#039;s a completely different feel, but they all make sense in context. They&amp;#039;ve\ngot a few common points, but overall there&amp;#039;s a lot of different voices and\nperspectives and styles. It would be dishonest for us to hold back any of these\nelements. Stump described the album&amp;#039;s first single &quot;This Ain&amp;#039;t A Scene, It&amp;#039;s An\nArms Race&quot; as &quot;a hip-hop/R&amp;B song, but written as a punk song..&quot; Beyond that, he\nmentions a &quot;borderline classic rock&quot; as well as a greater use of piano, as well\nas strings and horns, though he claims that &quot;we were really restrained about\nit.&quot; Guests confirmed so far include hip hop producer Jay-Z, Panic! At The\nDisco&amp;#039;s Ryan Ross and New Found Glory&amp;#039;s Chad Gilbert. The record is due out on\nFebruary 6th, 2007.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6c0c2599d3cc5e4b4f6a4cd0a4230e2592592f","amp;dn":"Fall_Out_Boy-Infinity_On_High-2007-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6c0c2599d3cc5e4b4f6a4cd0a4230e2592592f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,108,12,37,153,211,204,94,75,79,106,76,208,164,35,14,37,146,89,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
