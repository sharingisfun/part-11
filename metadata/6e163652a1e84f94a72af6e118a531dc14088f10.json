Song for the asking\n\n\nAfter half a decade of pop superstardom, America&amp;#039;s favourite folk-rock duo were just about ready to go their separate ways (at least Simon was), but not before releasing this gem of a swan song. Possibly S&amp;G&amp;#039;s most diverse album, BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER firmly established them as creators of popstandards on a par with Irving Berlin or Johnny Mercer. Thetitle tune alone, a beautifully unfolding gospel-tinged vowof emotional commitment, places them in the pop hall of fame forever.\nThe story obviously doesn&amp;#039;t stop there. Foreshadowing Simon&amp;#039;s solo work, the jubilant love song &quot;Cecilia&quot; and the poignant, yearning &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; both turn to thetraditions of other cultures for musical inspiration. The highly metaphorical &quot;The Boxer&quot; is the only real throwback toSimon&amp;#039;s more self-conscious early work. The transcendent production of &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; puts a pop sheen on an early example of Simon&amp;#039;s nascent Randy Newman influence. What a way to say goodbye.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e163652a1e84f94a72af6e118a531dc14088f10","amp;dn":"Simon+and+Garfunkel-Bridge+Over+Troubled+Water%28KRG%29gadge007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e163652a1e84f94a72af6e118a531dc14088f10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,22,54,82,161,232,79,148,167,42,246,225,24,165,49,220,20,8,143,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
