It is said that the first Sunday of every month between 1968 and 1972, Searl demonstrated his generators and flying discs to the general public. Television cameramen and news reporters were supposedly present for the events, and Searl claims he also demonstrated his flying disc to US military personnel.\n\nNot surprisingly, opposition to a fuel-less device was fierce.
