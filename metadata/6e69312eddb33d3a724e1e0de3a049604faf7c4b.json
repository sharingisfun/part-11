Starring Mickey Rourke, Faye Dunaway, Alice Krige.\n\nNOTE: One of best movies I have ever seen. Watched in cinema some twenty years ago, but it is one &quot;etched&quot; in my mind. Barfly is the delightfully gritty tale of a warrior poet (Rourke) disguised as a drunken idiot who lives in a roach motel and, a drunk who can never pay his bar tab. Mickey Rourke shines in the lead role and in my opinion deserved an Oscar for his brilliant performance. Faye Dunaway also gives a great performance as Mick's love interest. Rourke creates a cult icon that will keep you in stitches and riveted for the duration of the film. You'll talk about this movie long after viewing it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e69312eddb33d3a724e1e0de3a049604faf7c4b","amp;dn":"Barfly.1987.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e69312eddb33d3a724e1e0de3a049604faf7c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,105,49,46,221,179,61,58,114,78,30,13,227,160,73,96,79,175,124,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
