Unlike the standard comics published by Marvel, which often take place in story arcs spanning several issues, each Marvel Adventures comic tells a standalone story.\n\nThe idea was initially established as the Marvel Age imprint in 2003.  In 2005 the Marvel Age imprint was rebooted as Marvel Adventures.  This time around, the stories would be original and not based on existing stories. To escape the trappings of having to reflect the events of other Marvel titles, none of the titles take place within the primary Marvel Universe continuity.   Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four, for instance, has made reference to existing in the Earth-20051 realm of the Multiverse.  In addition, each title under the Marvel Adventures imprint seems to have its own continuity set apart from the other titles.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7245c7c3f2c74c654c6783bc04f2a4de8b8aa8","amp;dn":"Marvel+Adventures+Titles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e7245c7c3f2c74c654c6783bc04f2a4de8b8aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,114,69,199,195,242,199,76,101,76,103,131,188,4,242,164,222,139,138,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
