She was one of the more popular acts at the Monterey Pop Festival and later became one of the major attractions to the Woodstock festival and the Festival Express train tour. Joplin charted five singles, and other popular songs from her four-year solo career include &quot;Down on Me&quot;, &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Ball 'n' Chain&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Kozmic Blues&quot;, &quot;Work Me, Lord&quot;, &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, and her only number one hit, &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;.\n\nJoplin was well known for her performing abilities, and her fans referred to her stage presence as &quot;electric&quot;.
