Along with an essay and commentary by Robert Marteau, the volume includes a catalogue of all the Chagall lithographs engraved by Charles Sorlier. Marc Chagall is the last of the great masters of twentieth century art, who has consecrated more of his genius to the art of lithography than any other painter. &quot;It seems to me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that something would have been missing from my life if,\nat a certain moment, apart from color, I had not taken an interest in lithography and engraving. It is one thing to draw quite well, another to be able to turn one's hand to the subtleties of lithography.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9f9cbe60a7ce7f5e176554b6a34e03b5a14e7e","amp;dn":"Chagall+lithographs+1974-1979+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9f9cbe60a7ce7f5e176554b6a34e03b5a14e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,159,156,190,96,167,206,127,94,23,101,84,182,163,78,3,181,161,78,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
