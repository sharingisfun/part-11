Born in Belgium and raised in Melbourne, de Backer began making music in his bedroom as a teen, and for several years fronted the rock band Downstares. After the group dissolved, he gravitated toward cut-and-paste electronic music, and in 2003 issued the first Gotye album, Boardface. Like Drawing Blood followed two years later, notching the cult hit &quot;Learnalilgivinanlovin&quot; and earning J Award consideration from the influential Aussie radio station Triple J. de Backer concurrently served in the Melbourne pop trio the Basics. In 2011 Gotye released Making Mirrors, featuring a duet with vocalist Kimbra, &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know.&quot; The song became a global hit in 2012, charting in Billboard's Hot 100 and Rock Songs charts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb35dfc689d8609444474a9a53a6994af8eeb2f","amp;dn":"Gotye+-+Discography+%282004-2011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb35dfc689d8609444474a9a53a6994af8eeb2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,179,93,252,104,157,134,9,68,68,116,169,165,58,105,148,175,142,235,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
