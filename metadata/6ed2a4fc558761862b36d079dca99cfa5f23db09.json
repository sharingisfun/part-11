Their first release shows much of the heavy metal sound typical of many of the popular rock bands emerging from Britain earlier in the decade. Rush were fans of such bands as Led Zeppelin and Cream, and these influences can be heard in most of the songs on this debut. Original drummer John Rutsey performed all drum parts on the album, but was unable to go on extended tours because of diabetes and left the band after the album was released. Rutsey wrote some lyrics for the debut, but never submitted them to the band and some new lyrics had to be thrown together. He was soon replaced by Neil Peart.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Finding My Way&quot;   \t5:03\n2. \t&quot;Need Some Love&quot;   \t2:16\n3. \t&quot;Take A Friend&quot;   \t4:27\n4. \t&quot;Here Again&quot;     \t7:30\n5. \t&quot;What You're Doing&quot;   \t4:19\n6. \t&quot;In the Mood&quot;   \t3:36\n7. \t&quot;Before And After&quot;   \t5:33\n8. \t&quot;Working Man&quot;   \t7:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed2a4fc558761862b36d079dca99cfa5f23db09","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Rush+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed2a4fc558761862b36d079dca99cfa5f23db09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,210,164,252,85,135,97,134,43,54,208,121,220,169,156,250,95,35,219,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
