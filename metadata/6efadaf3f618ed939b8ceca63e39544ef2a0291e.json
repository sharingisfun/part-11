This pairing brings with it tension because Batman doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sanction the HuntressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sometimes-extreme methods, and Nightwing and Huntress are physically attracted to one another. Artwork by Greg Land and Bill Sienkiewicz highlight a taut story by newcomer Devin Grayson. Events begin with the murder of a call girl in a hotel room reserved under the name of Frankie Black. But Black reserved the room as an alibi to cover his mob activities elsewhere and is innocent of the girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s murder. This doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter to The Huntress who reasons that he is no doubt guilty of other murders. Nightwing maintains that hanging this rap on Black allows the real murderer to get off. Add to the scenario a missing vice cop. It seems she was working undercover as a call girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nBY DEVIN GRAYSON,GREG LAND AND BILL SIENKIEWICZ\n\nPUBLISHED BY DC\n\nENJOY AND SEED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efadaf3f618ed939b8ceca63e39544ef2a0291e","amp;dn":"NIGHTWING+AND+HUNTRESS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efadaf3f618ed939b8ceca63e39544ef2a0291e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,250,218,243,246,24,237,147,155,140,236,166,62,57,84,78,242,160,41,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
