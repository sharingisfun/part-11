Later, &quot;Brainstorm on the U.D.S.&quot; alternates rap verses with a punky shoutalong chorus, while &quot;The Devil&quot; borrows a murky string bassline and greasy slide guitar from the Tom Waits bag. Rudeboy never really sings; rather, he raps or -- when the song demands it -- sort of chants along in a singsong cadence. But for a non-singer he has a great voice, one that comes from the chest but has a sharp enough edge to cut through the mix. Also notable are polymath guitarist Tres Manos and the unbelievably funky bass of Silly Sil. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01. Fast Lane                                     \n02.
