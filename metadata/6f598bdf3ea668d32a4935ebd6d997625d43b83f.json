Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those '80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera's mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new album debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; was getting massive airplay.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Hot And Heavy\n02.I Am The Night\n03.Onward We Rock\n04.DGTTM\n05.Daughters Of The Queen\n06.Down Below\n07.Come-On Eyes\n08.Right On The Edge\n09.Valhalla\n10.Forever Tonight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f598bdf3ea668d32a4935ebd6d997625d43b83f","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+I+Am+The+Night+%281985%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f598bdf3ea668d32a4935ebd6d997625d43b83f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,89,139,223,62,166,104,211,42,73,53,235,214,217,151,98,93,67,184,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
