A computer savant who has developed digital profiling tools that the police have come to depend on, Sean has acquired a reputation for being able to solve crimes that no one else can. But when his own girlfriend, Alex, is brutally murdered while researching an off-grid torture facility called The Boathouse, his brilliant inventions are of no use. Alex has left little for Sean to go on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ only a list of names. Then Peter Sinclair, a property billionaire, contacts Sean for help. His wife, Becky, has been kidnapped and will be killed if he goes to the police or doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t follow instructions. Sean agrees to help. Not because he wants the case, but because Peter Sinclair was on AlexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list. When Sean tracks Becky down, she leads him right where he wants to go. Or so he thinks. As he climbs over the wall of the Boathouse, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one step from finding AlexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killers. But Sean is utterly unprepared for this crime and this place. The Boathouse is more heinous, more sinister than anything Sean has ever imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fbd05f20a8b71c2578fa9b128f5d7dddae9b51e","amp;dn":"The+Boathouse+-+R.J.Harries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fbd05f20a8b71c2578fa9b128f5d7dddae9b51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,189,5,242,10,139,113,194,87,143,169,177,40,245,215,221,218,233,181,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
