Now you want to rediscover the freedom of that two-wheeler. This book is an introduction for you--for adults who haven't ridden in years or aren't riding as much as they want to. Sure, you never forget how to ride a bike, but if you haven't been in a bike shop in years, you will be overwhelmed by all the choices and all the sparkly new machines. How do all the brake designs compare? What sort of frame style is best for your intended riding? This book answers those questions. Also covered are some very basic bike repairs that every rider should master, along with numerous riding tips.\n\nAbout the Author\nKaren Ruth is a massage therapist, writer, and cyclist in Minneapolis. She has cycle toured (self-supported) across the US, in Canada, France, and Ireland. She rides a Terry Symmetry for fun and Civia Loring for commuting and errand running. A Motobecane mixte, pulled from the neighbor's trash, is waiting in the garage to be converted into a fixed gear ride. A Brompton folding bike is next on the list of purchases.\n\nContents\nINTRODUCTION\nWHY BIKE?
