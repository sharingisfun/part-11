It is a transitional work, with elements of both the earlier Kinks' styles (heavily blues-influenced songs such as &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot;, and variations on the band's hits from 1964-65 such as &quot;Till the End of the Day&quot;) and early indications of the future direction of Ray Davies' songwriting styles (&quot;The World Keeps Going Round&quot; and &quot;I'm On an Island&quot;). The album's title is a mocking reference to the notorious reputation the band had developed over the previous year, including onstage fights and concert riots in Europe, which led to a ban on the group's concerts in the US.\n\n&quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot; makes several references and/or allusions to Beatles and Rolling Stones songs.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 1\n\n01. \t&quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot;   \tarranged by The Kinks \t3:44\n02. \t&quot;Ring the Bells&quot;   \t  \t2:21\n03. \t&quot;Gotta Get the First Plane Home&quot;   \t  \t1:49\n04. \t&quot;When I See That Girl of Mine&quot;   \t  \t2:12\n05. \t&quot;I Am Free&quot;   \tDave Davies \t2:32\n06. \t&quot;Till the End of the Day&quot;   \t  \t2:21\n07. \t&quot;The World Keeps Going Round&quot;   \t2:36\n08. \t&quot;I'm On an Island&quot;   \t2:19\n09. \t&quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot;   \t2:53\n10. \t&quot;It's Too Late&quot;   \t2:37\n11. \t&quot;What's in Store for Me&quot;   \t2:06\n12. \t&quot;You Can't Win&quot;   \t2:42\n\nDeluxe Edition - Disc 2\n\n01. \t&quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot;   \t3:04\n02. \t&quot;Sittin' on My Sofa&quot;   \t3:09\n03. \t&quot;I'm Not Like Everybody Else&quot;   \t3:30\n04. \t&quot;Mr. Reporter&quot; (outtake) \t3:58\n05. \t&quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot;  \t2:54\n06. \t&quot;Time Will Tell&quot; (outtake) \t2:46\n07. \t&quot;And I Will Love You&quot; (unissued EP track) \t2:26\n08. \t&quot;I'm Not Like Everybody Else&quot; \t3:33\n09. \t&quot;All Night Stand&quot; (Ray Davies solo demo) \t1:54\n10. \t&quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot; (BBC performance) \t2:47\n11. \t&quot;Ray Talks about Songwriting&quot; (BBC interview) \t1:02\n12. \t&quot;Never Met a Girl Like You Before&quot; (BBC performance) \t2:01\n13. \t&quot;Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight&quot; (BBC performance) \t1:49\n14. \t&quot;Pete Talks about Records&quot; (BBC interview) \t1:17\n15. \t&quot;Till the End of the Day&quot; (BBC performance) \t2:19\n16. \t&quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; (BBC performance) \t2:41\n17. \t&quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot; (BBC performance) \t2:46","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70433b409e2fd19812e542b9f762f1272a8943e4","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+The+Kink+Kontroversy+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70433b409e2fd19812e542b9f762f1272a8943e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,67,59,64,158,47,209,152,18,229,66,185,247,98,241,39,42,137,67,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
