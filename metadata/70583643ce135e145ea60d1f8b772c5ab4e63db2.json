The further you are, the safer it is to look.\n*  Your flashlight has a limited battery; it will not drain while it is turned off.  You also can look at the\nSlender Man longer while it is off.  However, having it off will make you easier to catch.\n*  Jogging/sprinting causes your stamina to drop; it recovers when walking, and recovers twice as fast when \nstanding still.\n*  Sprinting causes your maximum stamina to drop slightly; jogging does not.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70583643ce135e145ea60d1f8b772c5ab4e63db2","amp;dn":"Slender%3A+The+Eight+Pages+0.9.7+%28Mac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70583643ce135e145ea60d1f8b772c5ab4e63db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,88,54,67,206,19,94,20,94,166,13,31,139,119,44,90,180,230,61,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
