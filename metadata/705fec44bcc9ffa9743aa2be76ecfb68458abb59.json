Each chapter of this dynamic and approachable volume focuses on a movement in architectural history, including Byzantine, Baroque, Mannerism, Historicism, Functionalism, and Deconstruction. Unique to this work is HarbisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wide-ranging approach, which draws on references and examples outside of architectureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from literature, art, sculpture, and historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to further illustrate and contextualize the themes and ideas of each period. For example, the travel writing of Pausanias illustrates the monuments of ancient Greece, a poem in praise of marble decoration reveals how the builders of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia viewed their creation, and a French rococo painting speaks to the meaning behind the design of the English landscape garden.\n\nOriginal, yet authoritative, Travels in the History of Architecture will be in an indispensable guide for everyone curious to know more about the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous structures, as well as for students of art and architectural history seeking a definitive introduction\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPreface 7\n1 Egyptian 13\n2 Greek 34\n3 Roman 59\n4 Byzantine 80\n5 Romanesque 95\n6 Gothic 112\n7 Renaissance 135\n8 Mannerism 159\n9 Baroque 173\n10 Historicism 199\n11 Modernism I: Functionalism 217\n12 Modernism II: Expressionism, Constructivism\nand Deconstruction 236\nAfterword 264\nFurther Reading 269\nAcknowledgements 277\nPhoto Acknowledgements 279\nIndex 281\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:705fec44bcc9ffa9743aa2be76ecfb68458abb59","amp;dn":"Travels+in+the+History+of+Architecture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"705fec44bcc9ffa9743aa2be76ecfb68458abb59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,95,236,68,188,201,255,169,116,58,162,190,118,236,251,104,69,138,187,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
