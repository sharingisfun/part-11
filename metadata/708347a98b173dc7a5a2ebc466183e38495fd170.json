With its multi-layered arrangements that sensitively balance the electric with the acoustic, it is the perfect vehicle for a singer who is rooted in the past, yet singing for the present while looking to the future ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a va se savoir ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 'that will be known'.\n- Sterns\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview -\n\nThere was a time, back in the post-independence era of the 1960s and 70s, when the west African state of Guinea was one of the musical centres of the continent, thanks to President SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©kou TourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s policy of providing state funds for new music influenced by traditional styles, and the subsequent rise of remarkable bands such as Bembeya Jazz. The neighbouring countries of Mali and Senegal may have made all the running since then, but there is still a strong music scene in Guinea, as shown by this impressive new album from Amadou Sodia. He plays the four-stringed bolon and is also a fine singer with a confident, easy grandeur that at times echoes Salif Keita - perhaps not surprising, as the musical direction and acoustic guitar work is provided by KantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Manfila, who has long been associated with the great Malian singer. This is a confident, gently sturdy set that continues the Guinean tradition of balancing the old and the new, with traditional instruments such as the bolon, balafon and kora, matched against guitars, saxophone, flute and cello. Sodia emerges as one of the great under-recognised African singers, though it would be good to hear more variety in his elegant, stately songs.\n- The Guardian\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTrack List\n01 - Adiananco\n02 - ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡a Va Se Savoir\n03 - Sini\n04 - Kouroussa\n05 - Issin\n06 - Fanta KeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ta\n07 - Diadondiala\n08 - Kana Presser Ntafo\n09 - Ntafo\n10 - Tagnongo\n11 - Kaba\n12 - Dembo\n13 - Afo Pardon\n14 - Tibilila\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nTQMP.
