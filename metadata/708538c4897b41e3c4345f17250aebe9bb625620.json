The all-new VC is bursting with nice details, such as a fully-functioning hover gauge, a drift indicator, mousable radios and a completely modelled rear cabin area. A wonderful TSS sounds package provides highly realistic audio, both inside and out. Carefully-tuned flight dynamics make the Sea King a delight to fly, with nimble agility at low speed and safe stability at cruise. The cockpit is detailed but not too systems-intensive, so novice FSX users and those new to rotorcraft will have no trouble in getting into the air in the Virtavia Sea King, whilst there is still plenty to occupy the seasoned helicopter flyer. The exterior benefits from bump mappng of every rivet and a subtle specular shine.
