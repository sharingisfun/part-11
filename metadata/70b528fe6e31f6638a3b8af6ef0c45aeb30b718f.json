The authors of the present volume have overcome this obstacle by leading the reader slowly from the concrete to the abstract, from the simple to the complex, employing effectively graphs or Cayley diagrams to help the student visualize some of the structural properties of groups. Among the concrete examples of groups, the authors include groups of congruence motions and groups of permutations. A conscientious reader will acquire a good intuitive grasp of this powerful subject.\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b528fe6e31f6638a3b8af6ef0c45aeb30b718f","amp;dn":"Groups+and+Their+Graphs+-+New+Mathematical+Library+14+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b528fe6e31f6638a3b8af6ef0c45aeb30b718f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,181,40,254,110,49,246,99,138,59,138,246,239,12,69,174,179,11,113,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
