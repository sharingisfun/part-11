It matters not under what flag the former sails: it stands in opposition to the Christian, that is, the true religion.\n Even the most cursory examination of the ethnic religions should convince one of this truth. All these religions instruct men to work out their own salvation. Nor is this all: The ethnic religions not only teach men to save themselves; they also promise a salvation which is quite naturalistic in its concept. It is the life of this earth lived again, minus its disappointing features.\n One of the aims of this book is that this study of cults will convince evangelical Christians of the necessity of studying more carefully their faith and that we shall learn to appreciate the doctrine that is unto godliness.\n\nTable of Contents:\nThe Issue Defined\nSpiritism\nTheosophy (and the Liberal Catholic church)\nRosicrucianism\nChristian Science\nThe Unity School of Christianity\nBaha'ism\nMormonism\nDestiny of America (Anglo-Israelism)\nSeventh-day Adventism\nJehovah's Witnesses\nBuchmanism (Moral Re-Armament)\nUnitarianism Modernism\nSwedenborgianism\nThe Book and the Faith\nApproaching Adherents of the Cults\nThe Christian Religion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718941d55961063ce492bf1bd32d3a6fe6d70423","amp;dn":"The+Chaos+Of+Cults+-+A+Study+In+Present+Day+Isms+-+J.K.+van+Baal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718941d55961063ce492bf1bd32d3a6fe6d70423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,137,65,213,89,97,6,60,228,146,191,27,211,45,58,111,230,215,4,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
