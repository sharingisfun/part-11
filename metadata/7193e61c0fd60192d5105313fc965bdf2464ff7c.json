Profane, affectionate, and radically honest, California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach's verses perfectly capture the familiar--and unspoken--tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, they open up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations, and laugh at their absurdity.With illustrations by Ricardo Cortes, Go the Fuck to Sleep is beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny--a book for parents new, old, and expectant. You probably should not read it to your children.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7193e61c0fd60192d5105313fc965bdf2464ff7c","amp;dn":"Go+The+Fuck+To+Sleep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7193e61c0fd60192d5105313fc965bdf2464ff7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,147,230,28,15,214,1,146,213,16,83,19,252,150,91,223,36,100,255,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
