Sealed inside a giant wall, the lowlife occupants of District 13 are ruled by the drug-addled comedy gangster Taha (Bibi Naceri) and his motley crew of Goldie Lookin? Chain rejects. When the dimwits mysteriously acquire a massive bomb and trip the 24-hour fuse, elite cop Damien (Rafaelli) teams up with local resident and crime stopper LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯to to save the day.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;A SUPER-SIZED DIET OF INCREDIBLE ACTION\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\nWith a sub A-Team plot and acting that makes the Teletubbies look like a Chekhov play, District 13 survives solely on its super-sized diet of incredible action and pounding beats. Both Raffaelli and Belle (the latter Parkour?s inventor) execute their own stunts, which gives the film a non CG-enhanced realism, stylishly captured by first-time director Pierre Morel. Instantly forgettable, but hugely entertaining for 85 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a354e7d85c7d45ca5c858833bbe49b941b4b29","amp;dn":"District+13+DVDRIP+XviD-+French+Language.+English+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a354e7d85c7d45ca5c858833bbe49b941b4b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,163,84,231,216,92,125,69,202,92,133,136,51,187,228,155,148,27,75,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
