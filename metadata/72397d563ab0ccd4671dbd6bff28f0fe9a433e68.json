The album is impressive enough for the inestimable technical innovation of leaders Ralph Hutter and Florian Schneider, but their formidable writing skills are also on full display. Glowing, liquid synthesizers are as expressive as a human voice in &quot;Neon Lights&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot;. Sombre melodies and shimmering washes complement each other perfectly in &quot;Spacelab&quot;, while heavily processed vocals provide pointed contrast in both that song and the moody title track. &quot;The Robots&quot; is a bold statement of intent, executed with exotic staccato melodies and skilfully deployed sound effects. &quot;The Model&quot; is an almost prescient glimpse at the commercial synth pop that would arise in Kraftwerk's considerable wake\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\t&quot;Europe Endless&quot;  \tRalf HÃƒÂ¼tter, Florian Schneider\tHÃƒÂ¼tter\t9:40\n2.\t&quot;The Hall of Mirrors&quot;  \tHÃƒÂ¼tter, Schneider, Emil Schult\t7:56\n3.\t&quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;  \tHÃƒÂ¼tter\tHÃƒÂ¼tter\t6:15\n4.\t&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;  \tHÃƒÂ¼tter, Schult\tHÃƒÂ¼tter\t6:37\n5.\t&quot;Metal on Metal&quot;  \t \tHÃƒÂ¼tter\t6:52\n6.\t&quot;Franz Schubert&quot;  \t \tHÃƒÂ¼tter\t4:26\n7.\t&quot;Endless Endless&quot;  \t \tHÃƒÂ¼tter, Schneider\t0:55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72397d563ab0ccd4671dbd6bff28f0fe9a433e68","amp;dn":"+Kraftwerk+-+Trans-Europe+Express","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72397d563ab0ccd4671dbd6bff28f0fe9a433e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,57,125,86,58,176,204,212,103,29,189,107,255,40,240,254,154,67,62,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
