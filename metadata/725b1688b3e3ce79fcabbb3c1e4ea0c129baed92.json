With guitarist Cornell Dupree (in excellent form), bassist Jerry Jemmott and drummer Oliver Jackson laying down the foundation, Curtis and Dupree find a great deal of common musical ground.  Dupree has quite a few witty vocals (particularly the near-classic &quot;Junker's Blues&quot;) while taking choruses of irregular length that keep his sidemen continually guessing.  Curtis' distinctive tenor is also heard from, making one truly regret that this was his final recording.  ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nKing Curtis (Tenor and Alto Saxophone) \nChampion Jack Dupree (Piano and Vocals) \nCornell Dupree (Guitar) \nJerry Jemmott (Bass Guitar) \nOliver Jackson (Drums) \n\nKing Curtis &amp; Champion Jack Dupree - Blues at Montreux Tracks:\n01  Junkers Blues (Jack Dupree) 8:10 \n02  Sneaky Pete (Jack Dupree/King Curtis) 6:16 \n03  Everythings Gonna Be Alright (Jack Dupree/King Curtis) 5:29 \n04  Get With It (Jack Dupree/King Curtis) 3:33 \n05  Poor Boy Blues (Jack Dupree/King Curtis) 9:30 \n06  I'm Having Fun (Jack Dupree/King Curtis) 5:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:725b1688b3e3ce79fcabbb3c1e4ea0c129baed92","amp;dn":"King+Curtis+%26+Champion+Jack+Dupree+-+Blues+at+Montreux+%281971%29+%5BJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"725b1688b3e3ce79fcabbb3c1e4ea0c129baed92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,91,22,136,179,227,206,121,252,171,187,60,30,78,160,193,41,186,237,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
