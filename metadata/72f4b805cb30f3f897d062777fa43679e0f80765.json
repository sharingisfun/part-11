The chia plant is a relative of the mint plant. It makes tiny, flavorless, gluten-free seeds that are chock full of antioxidants and fiber, and when combined with water, they can be used as a replacement for butter or oil in your favorite baked goods. In addition, the seeds contain an oil that naturally repels pests, making it easy for farmers to grow the seeds organically, without the use of pesticides. If thatâ€™s not enough to convince you to try them, consider that chia seeds help balance blood sugar, prevent diseases such as diverticulitis and diverticulosis, and contain the essential fatty acid omega-3, which lowers hypertension and benefits your heart. Itâ€™s surprisingly easy to cook and bake with chia seeds, and because they take on the flavor of whatever ingredients theyâ€™re mixed with, theyâ€™ll only enhance your favorite dishes\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nCHIA SEED BREAKFASTS\r\nCHIA SIDE DISHES, SANDWICHES, AND BURGERS\r\nCHIA DINNERS\r\nCHIA DESSERTS\r\nAPPETIZERS AND SNACKS\r\nCHIA BEVERAGES","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f4b805cb30f3f897d062777fa43679e0f80765","amp;dn":"The+Chia+Seed+Cookbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f4b805cb30f3f897d062777fa43679e0f80765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,244,184,5,203,48,243,248,151,208,98,119,127,164,54,121,224,248,7,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
