The book maintains the hallmark organization of the previous edition as well as the time-tested problem solving methodology, which incorporates outlines of procedures and numerous sample problems to help ease students through the transition from theory to problem analysis. Emphasis is placed on giving students the introduction to the field that they need along with the problem-solving skills that will help them in their subsequent studies. This is demonstrated in the text by the presentation of fundamental principles before the introduction of advanced/special topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73411888c091bb088cefb8f832cc897c734a523f","amp;dn":"Mechanics+of+Materials+%282e%29+%5BPytel+%26+Kiusalaas%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73411888c091bb088cefb8f832cc897c734a523f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,65,24,136,192,145,187,8,140,239,184,248,50,204,137,124,115,74,82,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
