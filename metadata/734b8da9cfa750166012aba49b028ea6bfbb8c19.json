Some specialists have raved about these as among the more innovative and eclectic early metal efforts, which probably says more about the severe limitations of the form than the group&amp;#039;s creativity. There are touches of progressive rock in their work, especially on the longer tracks. But there&amp;#039;s little here that a head-banger couldn&amp;#039;t immediately relate to, which may serve as a recommendation or a warning, depending upon your taste. Just as recent metal bands have garnished their core with dashes of contemporary trends like grunge, punk, or AOR rock, so did Sir Lord Baltimore reflect the hard rock/progressive rock of their day, without enough hooks or imagination to attract either commercial or critical success. An odd footnote, though, was the involvement of future Bruce Springsteen manager Mike Appel, who co-wrote and helped arrange all of the songs on their first LP.\n(www.allmusic.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:734b8da9cfa750166012aba49b028ea6bfbb8c19","amp;dn":"Sir+Lord+Baltimore+-+Kingdom+Come+%26+Sir+Lord+Baltimore+%281970%26197","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"734b8da9cfa750166012aba49b028ea6bfbb8c19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,75,141,169,207,167,80,22,96,18,171,164,155,2,142,166,191,187,140,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
