Billy Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GreatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the reigning Junior Middleweight Champion whose unorthodox stance, the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southpaw,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ consists of an ineloquent, though brutal, display of offensive fighting... one fueled by his own feelings of inadequacy and a desperate need for love, money and fame. With a beautiful family, home and financial security, Billy is on top both in and out of the ring until a tragic accident leaves his wife dead and sends him into a downward spiral.\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nActors: Beau Knapp, Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson, Forest Whitaker, Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomie Harris, Oona Laurence, Rachel McAdams, Rita Ora, Victor Ortiz\n\nGenre: Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7357bdf4fcd763428dd9972e6f4a94a737790e91","amp;dn":"Southpaw.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7357bdf4fcd763428dd9972e6f4a94a737790e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,87,189,244,252,215,99,66,141,217,151,46,111,74,148,167,55,121,14,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
