The topics covered range from single-molecule, site-specific nanochemistry induced by a scanning tunneling microscope, through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy and current-induced heating, to current-triggered molecular machines. The various chapters focus on experimental and numerical method development, the description of specific systems, and new ideas and novel phenomena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a3454c6d3f788b65db3aa5e16c177475d77336","amp;dn":"Current-Driven+Phenomena+in+Nanoelectronics+-+Tamar+Seideman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a3454c6d3f788b65db3aa5e16c177475d77336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,163,69,76,109,63,120,139,101,219,58,165,225,108,23,116,117,215,115,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
