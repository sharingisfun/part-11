Now also with Particle Suite from Phoenix Tools. Valid license for both included. Works perfectly. It's much faster then XSI (which I never managed to work). I included two versions:\n- ISO image to burn on CD (if you have CD-ROM connected to your SGI)\n- tar.gz archive (for others)\nafter transfer to SGI in console go to directory where it is located and ungzip it (gunzip Soft3D_IRIX.tar.gz) then untar the tar archive you got (i.e. tar xvf Soft3D_IRIX.tar).\nThat software is still very powerful and impressive. I love it.\nGood luck! Have fun!\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f1cbe24153a1c570bd2464c039499358b1237f","amp;dn":"Softimage3D_4.0_IRIX_with_licence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f1cbe24153a1c570bd2464c039499358b1237f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,241,203,226,65,83,161,197,112,189,36,100,192,57,73,147,88,177,35,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
