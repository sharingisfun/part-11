The spiritual powers of 'the drum' and drumming are the focus of this video. Inspiring lessons and performances will expand anyone's playing on the Ashiko, Djembe and related drums.\n\n\n\nAmazon Customer review:\n\nAt the time of the production of this instructional Olatunji had over 50 years of teaching experience and no real peer, especially when he combines information about technique with the deeper cultural basis for the music. So not only do you get a lesson from a master drummer you get the lesson from a master teacher. Very fundamental techniques for obtaining the proper sounds are covered and the instruction progresses to examples of advanced ensemble playing. The fundamentals are stressed, and you are provided with the examples of Olatunji's own demonstrations along with two of his long-time Drums of Passion members, Sikiru Adepoju and Sanga Francis. Recording the sounds of a drum is always problematic but the sound quality here is very good so the distinctive differences in the basic sounds of the drum come across with good accuracy for the student to hear. As simple as a hand drum may seem the African music and rhythms taught by Olatunji have a sophistication but he conveys it all without making it over complicated. The pace of the instruction allows for a good level of concentration. With any recorded musical instruction one is mostly going to get a grounding and a concentration of main points to follow, this recording does that very well. Since Olatunji has passed on this is the closest you will get to having a personal lesson from him now. You can't help feeling like you want more time as his student. \n\n\nEnjoy and share knowledge\n-FTP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753bd992d6560caf7e19dbd76faf3fecadb3c60b","amp;dn":"African+Drumming%3A+With+Babatunde+Olatunji+%28instructional+vid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753bd992d6560caf7e19dbd76faf3fecadb3c60b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,59,217,146,214,86,12,175,126,25,219,215,111,175,63,236,173,179,198,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
