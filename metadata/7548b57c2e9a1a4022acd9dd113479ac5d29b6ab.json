This DVD combines the video and audio for you, no need to sync anything. The chapter markers have also been moved around a bit to fit the audio better. \n\nThere are actually two audio tracks, containing the final version and the somewhat rougher first version. The final version has more dialogue and is a smoother performance, so it is the default, but some people prefer the first version for various reasons (or just want to see how the project evolved) and so that is available too. Just change the audio track on your DVD player to switch between the two.\n\nThe DVD itself is pretty bare bones. If it were a commercial DVD, the &quot;Special Features&quot; section would probably have to include &quot;Chapter markers&quot; and &quot;Funny Voices&quot; as features. There's no menu, no subtitles, just the movie and the two soundtracks. The video itself is widescreen, and ripped straight from the DVD (compressed using DVD Shrink to fit on a single layer DVD, but the drop in quality isn't noticeable). Just put it into your DVD player and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7548b57c2e9a1a4022acd9dd113479ac5d29b6ab","amp;dn":"Wizard+People%2C+Dear+Readers+-+Both+versions%2C+DVD+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7548b57c2e9a1a4022acd9dd113479ac5d29b6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,72,181,124,46,154,26,64,34,172,217,221,17,52,121,172,93,41,182,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
