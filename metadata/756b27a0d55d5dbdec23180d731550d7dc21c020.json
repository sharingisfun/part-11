Christie ( 1970 )\n\n2. For All Mankind ( 1971 + bonus tracks from 1974)\n\n\nBoth are at 320 K.\n\nThis was a British rock band that very much embraced an American style\nfrom that era. After their second album Jeff Christie replaced most of\nthe guys in the band, and they released a few more albums that I haven't \nbeen able to find yet. However, some of those songs are included \nas bonus tracks on the first one here.\n\nJeff Christie took musicians from another band using the name Christie \nagain in 1990 and they toured into the 2000s, although as far as I \nknow no original albums were recorded after 1974.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756b27a0d55d5dbdec23180d731550d7dc21c020","amp;dn":"CHRISTIE+--+First+2+albums+Christie+and+For+All+Mankind+%28+1970s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756b27a0d55d5dbdec23180d731550d7dc21c020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,107,39,160,213,93,93,189,236,35,24,13,115,21,80,215,220,33,192,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
