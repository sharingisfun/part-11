The throne of Tamriel sits empty, the province's ruler the victim of an unknown assassin. The gates to Oblivion have flown open and demons are pouring through the gates, threatening to destroy all of Tamriel. It's your job to find the hidden royal heir who can restore order. But fear not, because there's more to be done! The Game of the Year Edition features the expansion pack, The Shivering Isles, and the content pack, Knights of the Nine, for even more open-ended adventuring.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756d71b5f3d784eb86a5eb972a27ee1bea0553bb","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+IV+Oblivion+GOTY+NTSC%2FU+PAL+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756d71b5f3d784eb86a5eb972a27ee1bea0553bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,109,113,181,243,215,132,235,134,165,235,151,42,39,238,27,234,5,83,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
