Summoning a giant flying saucer, he rips Peach's entire castle from its foundations and lifts it into outer space. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, Mario is catapulted across the cosmos and awakens on a small planet. On the planet he meets a mysterious woman called Rosalina (called Rosetta in the Japanese version) and her companion stars, the Lumas (Chiko in the Japanese version). Rosalina is a watcher of the stars, who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source have all been stolen by Bowser, rendering it immobile. Bestowed with the power to travel through space, Mario sets off on an intergalactic adventure across the universe to reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory. Along the way, Mario rescues his brother Luigi and the Toad Brigade, a small group of Toads (led by Toad) that escaped from Bowser when he stole Peach's Castle, all of whom help him find Power Stars after their rescues.\n\nUpon collecting enough Power Stars, Rosalina's Observatory has enough power to transform into a comet and fly to the center of the universe, where Peach is held captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that Bowser's plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach; however, in doing so, Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming the nearby galaxies, the Observatory, Peach's Castle, and Bowser's airships. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The galaxies sucked into the black hole collapse into a singularity and explode in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, stating that stars never die and are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              ***** enjoy ... ***** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759adffc8cddaaef4182bb90662f66b3abe73261","amp;dn":"Wii+4+PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+SUPER+MARIO+GALAXY+1+perfect+emulator+iso+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759adffc8cddaaef4182bb90662f66b3abe73261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,154,223,252,140,221,170,239,65,130,187,144,102,47,102,179,171,231,50,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
