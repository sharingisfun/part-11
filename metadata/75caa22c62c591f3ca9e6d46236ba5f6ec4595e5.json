Though the war in Afghanistan is still going, their hard-won lessons have yet to be assimilated by the Stateside bureaucracy. To help, Militant Tricks recounts America's progress in Iraq and Afghanistan from the standpoint of East Asian battlefield deception. Both countries were part of the Mongol Empire for over 200 years and thus prone to every sort of ancient Chinese illusion. Militant Tricks also contains the tactical &quot;techniques&quot; with which to counter a Muslim urban offensive. While some of these nontraditional techniques were risked during the Baghdad Surge, they may all too soon be forgotten.\n\n&quot;[John] Poole ... is America's best writer on small unit tactics and techniques.... If the people at the top will give John Poole's work the attention it is rightly receiving at the battalion level and below, we would have a better chance of winning [wars].&quot; -- United Press International, 19 November 2005\n\n&quot;Poole's book examines war at the tactical level, the level of small units and individuals, and tries to explain the insurgents' way of thinking and fighting.&quot; -- North County Times (San Diego), 31 December 2005\n\n&quot;[R]ead two excellent and relevant books by retired Marine H. John Poole. 'Tactics of the Crescent Moon' and 'Militant Tricks' would give all soldiers the knowledge base for defeating this enemy.&quot; -- Stars and Stripes, 9 March 2006\n\n&quot;[This] 412-page book features 45 illustrations and serves as both an intelligence reference manual and an in-depth solution to the enemy's formula.&quot; -- Newport News Daily Press, 8 January 2006\n\n&quot;'Militant Tricks' is a worthy supplement to John Poole's previous, excellent books on the Eastern way of war (father of 4th-Generation Warfare theory).&quot; -- William S. Lind, Fall 2005\n\n&quot;The best book on how to fight militants, resistance fighters, insurgents, or what ever you want to call them, is 'Militant Tricks' .... Poole ... has a keen insight [in]to the Islamic [warriors'] combat tactics and how they wage jihad in all its forms.&quot; -- Military.com, 21 December 2005\n\nPublisher \tPosterity Press; Illustrated edition (October 17, 2005)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t0963869582\nISBN-13 \t978-0963869586\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Militant-Tricks-Battlefield-Islamic-Insurgent/dp/0963869582/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372765608&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Militant+tricks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Militant-Tricks-Battlefield-Islamic-Insurgent/dp/0963869582/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372765608&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Militant+tricks&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75caa22c62c591f3ca9e6d46236ba5f6ec4595e5","amp;dn":"Militant+Tricks%3A+Battlefield+Ruses+of+the+Islamic+Insurgent++%5Bbl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75caa22c62c591f3ca9e6d46236ba5f6ec4595e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,202,162,44,98,197,145,243,202,158,109,70,35,107,165,246,236,69,149,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
