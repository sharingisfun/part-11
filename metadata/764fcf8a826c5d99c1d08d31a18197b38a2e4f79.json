Creatures of extraordinary beauty, power, and sensuality, they possess the ability to shape-shift from human to dragon and back again. Now their secretÃ¢â‚¬â€œand their survivalÃ¢â‚¬â€œis threatened by a temptation that will break every boundary....\nDubbed the Smoke Thief, a daring jewel thief is confounding the London police. His wealthy victims claim the master burglar can walk through walls and vanish into thin air. But Christoff, the charismatic Marquess of Langford, knows the truth: the thief is no ordinary human but a Ã¢â‚¬Å“runnerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fled Darkfrith without permission. As Alpha leader of the draÃ‚Â´kon, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s KitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duty to capture the fugitive before the secrets of the tribe are revealed to mortals. But not even Kit suspects that the Smoke Thief could be a woman. \nClarissa Rue Hawthorne knew her dangerous exploits would attract the attention of the draÃ‚Â´kon. But she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect Christoff himself to come to London, dangling the tribeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most valuable jewelÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe Langford DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â€œas bait. For as long as she could remember, Rue had lived the life of a halflingÃ¢â‚¬â€œhalf draÃ‚Â´kon, half mortalÃ¢â‚¬â€œand an outcast in both worlds. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d always loved the handsome and willful Kit from the only place it was safe: from afar. But now she was no longer the shy, timid girl sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d once been. She was the first woman capable of making the Turn in four generations. So why did she still feel the same dizzying sense of vulnerability whenever he was near?\nFrom the moment he saw her, Kit knew that the alluring and powerful beauty was every bit his Alpha equal and destined to be his bride. And by the harsh laws of the draÃ‚Â´kon, Rue knew that she was the property of the marquess. But they will risk banishment and worse for a chance at something greater. For now Rue is his prisoner, the diamond has disappeared, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made the kind of dangerous proposition a man like Kit cannot resist....In this bewitching novel, Shana AbÃƒÂ© transports us into a world of exhilarating romance and magic.\n\nThe Dream Thief (Drakon #2) by Shana Abe (August 28th 2007)\n\n\n\nQueen of Dragons (Drakon #3) by Shana Abe (December 26th 2007)\n\n\nThe Treasure Keeper (Drakon #4) by Shana Abe (March 24th 2009)\n\nWith such novels as Queen of Dragons and The Dream Thief, Shana AbÃƒÂ© has created a unique and vividly imagined world that exists side by side with our ownÃ¢â‚¬â€a realm populated by a race of supersensual men and women whose power to change shape permits them unlimited acts of pleasureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and ever-present danger. Now the survival of the drÃƒÂ¡kon rests in the hands of a young woman with untried and unexpected powersÃ¢â‚¬â€and the powerful Alpha male she must break every drÃƒÂ¡kon law to save. \n\nThe drÃƒÂ¡kon are at war, surrounded by an enemy they have every reason to fear. The sanf inimicus are no ordinary human beings but the most dangerous of hunters. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve sworn to exterminate the shape-shifters whose presence they now can detect, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already claimed a prize prisoner: Lord Rhys Langford.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a blow the drÃƒÂ¡kon clans feel from Darkfrith, England, all the way to the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania. But it strikes no one harder than Zoe Cyprienne Lane. A mere seamstressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Zoe isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even in the same league as Rhys. In fact, as an unwed male in the Alpha line, according to drÃƒÂ¡kon custom, he owns her. So nothing could be more outrageousÃ¢â‚¬â€or personally ruinousÃ¢â‚¬â€than the mere notion that she might set out on her own to find her childhood friend...and first true love.\nBut the unexpected is exactly what Zoe intends to do. For years sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been hiding two extraordinary Gifts that have set her apart from other drÃƒÂ¡kon females: the power to become invisible and the power to feel othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ emotions. Now, guided by a link to RhysÃ¢â‚¬â€his presence and touch as electric as if he were beside her in the fleshÃ¢â‚¬â€Zoe uses both Gifts to infiltrate the sanf inimicus. And for Rhys, whose time is running out, Zoe is his last lifeline to a worldÃ¢â‚¬â€and a loveÃ¢â‚¬â€he never thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d regain. Only together again, hunter and huntress, can they save the drÃƒÂ¡kon from the traitor in their midst who would destroy them all.\n\nThe Time Weaver (Drakon #5) by Shana Abe (June 1st 2010)\n\nFrom the highly acclaimed author of The Treasure Keeper and Queen of Dragons comes this mesmerizing new novel of the drÃƒÂ¡kon, a supersensual race of shapeshifters whose world exists side by side with our own. In The Time Weaver, a young drÃƒÂ¡kon woman discovers she possesses a unique gift, one that brings her closer to her destined loveÃ¢â‚¬â€at the cost of their very lives. \nHonor Carlisle may have been born into the drÃƒÂ¡kon clan but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always felt like a stranger to her kin. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an intuition that proves true when she receives a mysterious letterÃ¢â‚¬â€a letter sent by her future self. Honor learns she is a Time Weaver: a creature with the extraordinary ability to transport herself into the past or future. \nBut the letter contains a dire warning. If Honor remains in her home at Darkfrith, she is certain to be killed.
