Campe begs to differ. Mathematical probability, he argues, took over the role of the old probability of poets, orators, and logicians, albeit in scientific terms. Indeed, mathematical probability would not even have been possible without the other probability, whose roots lay in classical antiquity.\nThe Game of Probability revisits the seventeenth and eighteenth-century &quot;probabilistic revolution,&quot; providing a history of the relations between mathematical and rhetorical techniques, between the scientific and the aesthetic. This was a revolution that overthrew the &quot;order of things,&quot; notably the way that science and art positioned themselves with respect to reality, and its participants included a wide variety of people from as many walks of life. Campe devotes chapters to them in turn. Focusing on the interpretation of games of chance as the model for probability and on the reinterpretation of aesthetic form as verisimilitude (a critical question for theoreticians of that new literary genre, the novel), the scope alone of Campe's book argues for probability's crucial role in the constitution of modernity.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n&quot;RÃƒÂ¼diger Campe's The Game of Probability lays outÃ¢â‚¬â€for the first time and in all its complexityÃ¢â‚¬â€a semantic field crucial to our modernity: to our social and juridical modernity, to our scientific and mathematical modernity, to our literary modernity. The breadth and depth of learning upon which this book rests will make it an invaluable resource for scholars across the historical-humanistic disciplines and the bright light generated by its readings will illuminate countless research projects. This marvelous book belongs among the most distinguished publications to have emerged out of cultural studies in Germany during the past thirty years.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€David E.
