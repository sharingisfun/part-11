Full DescriptionLitweller, John McDonough and Jessica Raimi. INTRODUCING THE VERVE JAZZ MASTERS is a sixteen-track sampler of cuts by artists who are part of the Verve Jazz Masters series. INTRODUCING... is this series' twentieth release.\n\nIf you want to listen to a huge variety of jazz icons all together in one CD, then you're in for a delight with this outstanding compilation CD. Most of the famous jazz giants are represented here - from the majestic royalties Count Basie and Duke Ellington to the original divas Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone and Billie Holiday, and not to mention Louis Armstrong, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Chick Corea, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie and Wes Montgomery. \n\nLouis Armstrong opens up with Cole Porter's &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot; and invites you for a &quot;trip to the moon on gossamer wings.&quot; Sarah Vaughan presents her tantalizing vocals in &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot; and shows off her versatility in scat singing. Stan Getz performs a Bossa Nova staple &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; with vocals from the husband-and-wife team of JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o and Astrud Gilberto. \n\nBill Evans contributes his delicate touch on the ivories as he plays &quot;Here's That Rainy Day.&quot; Every tune that Mr. Evans plays becomes a beautiful masterpiece. Erroll Garner plays his signature composition &quot;Misty&quot; with an enchanting arrangement making it one of the best tracks. Count Basie wraps up this presentation with a beautiful tune that takes you back to the fifties, &quot;April In Paris,&quot; a composition by Vernon Duke and Yip Harburg. \n\nThe First Lady of Song Ella Fitzgerald does a swinging Rodgers &amp; Hart song, &quot;Everything I've Got&quot; while Dinah Washington sings another beautiful version of Maria Grover and Stanley Adams' &quot;What A Diff'rence A Day Made&quot; (the other fabulous version is found in Diana Ross' charming album, Blue). \n\n&quot;What a diff'rence a day made \nTwenty-four little hours \nBrought the sun and the flowers \nWhere there used to be rain \n\nMy yesterday was blue, dear \nToday, I'm a part of you, dear \nMy lonely nights are thru, dear \nSince you said you were mine \n\nWhat a diff'rence a day makes \nThere's a rainbow before me \nSkies above can't be stormy \nSince that moment of bliss \n\nThat thrilling kiss \nIt's heaven when you find romance on your menu \nWhat a diff'rence a day made \nAnd the diff'rence is...you&quot; \n\nWith this CD, there is something wonderful to unfold if you're a fan of any of these jazz greats. If you're a fan of all of them, then so much the better. It's very rare to find an incredible collection such as this. It's a rare find...so check this out and enjoy! ~ Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue*\n\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 20 - Introducing Jazz Masters Tracks:\n01  Just One Of Those Things (Louis Armstrong) \n02  Woody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ You (Oscar Peterson) \n03  Lullaby Of Birdland (Sarah Vaughan) \n04  Tour De Force (Dizzy Gillespie) \n05  The Girl From Ipanema (Stan Getz) \n06  Diminuendo In Blue And Blow By Blow (Duke Ellington) \n07  Captain Marvel (Chick Corea) \n08  EvÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢rything IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got (Ella Fitzgerald) \n09  Impressions (Wes Montgomery) \n10  Love Me Or Leave Me (Nina Simone) \n11  Star Eyes (Charlie Parker) \n12  HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That Rainy Day (Bill Evans) \n13  What A DiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢rence A Day Made (Dinah Washington) \n14  Misty (Erroll Garner) \n15  A Fine Romance (Billie Holiday) \n16  April In Paris (Count Basie) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e3c07c1fcea8b9e9fbd0ea647651d1264f6429","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+20+-+Introducing+Jazz+Masters+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e3c07c1fcea8b9e9fbd0ea647651d1264f6429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,227,192,124,31,206,168,185,233,251,208,234,100,118,81,209,38,79,100,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
