This volume introduces a goal-oriented method that applies aspects of line, shape, value, and color directly to moving the viewer's eye to and through a composition. With this method, artists learn to incorporate feeling into the creative process from the outset rather than leaving it as a subjective afterthought. Equally applicable to the fine arts, applied arts, and digital media, Moving the Eye Through 2-D Design provides a simple and comprehensive methodology through which artists can create dynamic art.
