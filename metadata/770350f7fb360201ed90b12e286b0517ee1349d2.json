Duryea rides into town, claiming to be a U.S. Marshall with a warrant for the arrest of sheriff and model citizen Payne. With little actual evidence to support his charge of murder, Duryea embarks on a campaign of guilt by suspicion, while Payne tries to protect his reputation and his freedom. Made late in the career of the prolific Hollywood veteran Allan Dwan, Silver Lode was given high regard by Martin Scorsese in his A Personal Journey Through American Movies.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Silver lode.B Gems.Xvid.AVI\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 926,337,974 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:17:12\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.3\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1459 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.198 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nNot my rip.
