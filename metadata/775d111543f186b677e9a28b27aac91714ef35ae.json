On June 26, 2008, Mitch Lucker appeared on the Headbangers Ball blog podcast. In the interview, Mitch stated that the new album would be tracked as opposed to being recorded live, such as The Cleansing.\n\nIn 2009 Suicide Silence received a second award from Revolver at the Golden Gods Awards show for &quot;Best New Talent&quot;\n\nSound: When I first heard Suicide Silence, I thought &quot;absolutely brootal as f--k!&quot; That was back when I heard &quot;The Cleansing&quot;. Now, two years later, they've release &quot;No Time to Bleed&quot; and only one word can describe it. EPIC! SS have kept to their old sound of making f--king heavy deathcore music but they've also advanced in many ways. This album is all about the layered guitars and technical work. Mitch's vocals also are right on key the whole time. Most screamers' vocals tend to weaken over time but Mitch's hasn't. If anything, they are stronger and better with this album. By far, it is their heaviest album to date and it is probably the best. The work of the guitarists is pure gold. They've also brought in a more metal sound to them due to the fact that they are influenced with guitar solos, unlike &quot;The Cleansing&quot;. // 10\n\nLyrics and Singing: Unlike &quot;The Cleansing&quot;, Suicide Silence has gone into a more deeper, metaphorical way of lyrics. It's not like past songs where it is very blatant lyrics that are controversial and shocking such as Mitch's constant reference to calling out God in The Cleansing. These lyrics focus more on the world around us and society in general and also just the usual shock factor of any heavy band. They seem to match the music very well though and everything flows together. Mitch's vocals have increased greatly in talent. Even though he puts distortion on his voice, his differentiation between highs and lows is apparent. Also, his low growls and gutteralls have improved, including the use of slight pig-squeals at some times. // 10\n\nImpression: This album is like The Cleansing but like I said, it is very different. It is a much more mature sound for Suicide Silence.\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent\n\n* Mitch Lucker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Chris Garza ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Mark Heylmun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Alex Lopez ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (ex-The Funeral Pyre)\n* Dan Kenny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar (ex-Animosity, ex-Light This City)\n\nFormer\n\n* Tanner Womack - vocals\n* Joseph Traughber - vocals\n* Josh Tufano - guitar\n* Rick - guitar\n* Mike Bodkins - bass guitar\n* Michael Olheiser - bass guitar\n* Chris Grucelski - bass guitar\n* Justin Tufano - drums\n* Josh Goddard - drums\n\n\nSongs on the cd:\n\n01.&quot;Wake Up&quot;: a heavy song to start the album off and get you pumped for the rest of it. Sets the mood that it's going to be a heavy, fast-paced, brootal album.\n\n02.[b]&quot;Lifted&quot;[/b]: the first track to be released off of the album. Features heavy guitar and an amazing breakdown.\n\n03.&quot;Smoke&quot;: an intro that stays in your head and holds your attention the whole time. Very fast-paced song that gets you in the mood to mosh and circle-pit.\n\n04.&quot;Something Invisible&quot;: a very generic &quot;chug-chug&quot; heavy, fast song with some good guitar riffs.\n\n05.&quot;No Time to Bleed&quot;: the cover track and also one of my favorite songs. Very rememborable breakdown and fun to listen to.\n\n06.&quot;Suffer&quot;: also one of my favorite tracks on the album. This song is a fast-paced, heavy song. It has good guitar that keeps it going and the drumming is very good in this song. The song slows down about half way into the breakdown.\n\n07.&quot;...and Then She Bled&quot;: this song is the mid-point of the album and gives you a nice break. It's not a real legit song. It's more of an instrumental with ambient noises in the intro. It's kind of like a big breakdown. But the whole track has a backing track of what seems like a 911 call from a woman who was with someone and they are being chased by a murderer or something like that.\n\n08.&quot;Wasted&quot;: an intro reminiscent to &quot;Wake Up&quot; and then choppy vocals that lead back into the usual fast, blast-beat driven parts. Good song.\n\n09.&quot;Your Creations&quot;: by now, the album gets kind of repetitive but it's still a good song. Slows down at some random parts and then speeds right back up.\n\n10.&quot;Genocide&quot;: one of my favorite songs. Best lyrics on the album &quot;we've been f--king this whore mother earth for awhile. She's a filthy bitch anyway.&quot;\n\n11.&quot;Disengage&quot;: a heavy song to end the album with. Kind of a slower pace than most of the songs on the cd. Mitch uses his lows a lot on this song. Kind of like a big breakdown in a sense.\n\nWhat I love about the album is the brootalness of the whole thing and how it's fast paced and very guitar driven. I didn't like that after a while, the songs got a little repetitive and sounded the same.\n\nIf this CD were lost or stolen, I would definately go buy it right away, but I don't let it out of my sight so that shouldn't be a problem. Go buy this album, you won't regret it. Brootal as f--k. Suicide silence ftw! // 9\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/suicide_silence/no_time_to_bleed/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/suicide_silence/no_time_to_bleed/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775d111543f186b677e9a28b27aac91714ef35ae","amp;dn":"Suicide+Silence%282009%29No+Time+To+Bleed+v.2-CDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775d111543f186b677e9a28b27aac91714ef35ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,93,17,21,67,241,134,182,119,233,162,139,39,170,201,23,20,239,53,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
