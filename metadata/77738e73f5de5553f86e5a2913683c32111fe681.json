They have revived in the late 2000s and played several festivals.\n\nThe band was named after Comus, a masque by John Milton and is also from the name of the Greek god Comus. David Bowie appreciated them and used them as support band for a 1969 concert at London's Purcell Rooms.\n\nTheir first album, First Utterance, appeared in 1971. The music is largely acoustic art rock that blends elements of Eastern percussion, early folk and animal-like vocals. The music evokes many feelings, but the most dominant are fear, confusion, despair, with occasional passages of tranquil beauty such as can be found in &quot;The Herald&quot;. The lyrics are dramatic, involving violence, murder, and mental disorder. Apart from three tracks on First Utterance (&quot;The Herald&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Bitten&quot;), most of the songs were written by Roger Wootton and arranged by Glenn Goring. The group disbanded after this album, but they reunited with new members for their second album, which was to be their swansong, To Keep from Crying, in 1974.\n\nIn 2005, a complete box set was released which featured both studio albums, their only single, &quot;Diana&quot;, and a previously unreleased track called &quot;All the Colours of Darkness&quot;. The liner notes feature an exclusive interview with some members of the band. They reformed for the Mellotronen Festival in Sweden in March 2008. According to their website, they have reformed and are working on new material.\n\n\n\nAudio CD (26 Feb 2008) \nNumber of Discs: 2 \nFormat: Box set \nLabel: Sanctuary \nASIN: B0007W0KJ2\n\nDisc: 1  \n1.
