Every character in the movie plays a great part (this is Trapero's best film), relationships are shown with quite a simple eye, but with a lot of sensitivity. Some kind of argentinity is shown, the movie takes the spectator along the way with this family members who will show incredible capability to survive and pass on obstacles, and also amazing human vices, good and bad, but particularly and specially human. The way Trapero engages in dialog with the audience is extremely mature, the director finds the way to balance between not underestimating the audience shooting unnecessary and not pretending to find deep sociological or anthropological plots, just showing how everyone works. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Familia Rodante.2004.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 402 Kbps\nLength            : 1.66 GiB for 1h 38mn 56s 598ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 200 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 434 (1.659) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359254/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359254/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Spanish\nSubtitles: Portuguese, English, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77bbcb00b29b020b789d4f18d0b32f15b16d766f","amp;dn":"Familia+Rodante.2004.DVDRip.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77bbcb00b29b020b789d4f18d0b32f15b16d766f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,187,203,0,178,155,2,11,120,157,79,24,208,179,47,21,177,109,118,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
