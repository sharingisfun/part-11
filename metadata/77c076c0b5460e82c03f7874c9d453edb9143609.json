Mariana's father Carlos (Lautaro Delgado) divorced Cristina when Mariana was an infant, and while he occasionally looks in on his daughter, he's not around much while Mariana has begun displaying some behavior problems -- she fights with her classmates, cranks up her CD player rather than listen to her mom, and insists that people call her Gloria. Carlos unexpectedly comes back into the household, but not in a way that makes Cristina happy -- Carlos is short on work and has nowhere to live after breaking up with his girlfriend, so he's renting a room in the house. With her mom and dad reunited in a sense but frequently quarreling, now Mariana has even more to willfully ignore. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Francia.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,155,256,320 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:19:04\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x392 (AR: 1.837)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1746 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.258 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1383604/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1383604/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nAdrian Caetano - Francia (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c076c0b5460e82c03f7874c9d453edb9143609","amp;dn":"Adrian+Caetano+-+Francia+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c076c0b5460e82c03f7874c9d453edb9143609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,192,118,192,181,70,14,130,192,63,120,116,201,212,83,237,185,20,54,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
