A top 10 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at number eight, &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; was nominated for the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. It was voted the 69th Greatest Rap song as ranked in rap.about.com and number eight on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\n&quot;Gin and Juice&quot; was produced by Dr. Dre and performed by Snoop Doggy Dogg with David Ruffin Jr. The hook was written by Dr. Dre and David Ruffin Jr., which contained an interpolation of Slave's &quot;Watching You&quot; (the chorus) and an original bassline created by T. Green ( Edward Tony Green ). The original version's foundation beat is George McCrae's &quot;I Get Lifted&quot;; additional vocalists on the song include Dat Nigga Daz, Jewell, Heney Loc, and Sean &quot;Barney&quot; Thomas.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Dr. Dre, Calvin Caday and Anita Sisaath, also producers of 2Pac's &quot;Dear Mama&quot;, features a simple concept: teenager Snoop throws a wild house party after his parents leave the house. Ricky Harris plays Snoop's father, and Dr. Dre, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Daz Dillinger make cameo appearances. Six-year-old rapper Lil Bow Wow plays Snoop's little brother who is jumping on the couch in the intro.\n\nIn April 2005, the video was fourth on MTV2 and XXL's list of the 25 Greatest West Coast Videos. Snoop Dogg wears hockey jerseys of the now-defunct Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League and Pittsburgh Penguins (with the name and number 'GIN AND JUICE' 94 on the back) in the video.\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known by his stage names Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and more recently Snoop Lion, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and actor. Snoop has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre. He collaborated on Dre's solo debut The Chronic, and on the theme song to the feature film Deep Cover.\n\nSnoop's debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records, debuting at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified 4Ãƒâ€” platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including &quot;What's My Name&quot; and &quot;Gin &amp; Juice&quot;.
