Winter's first release after a self-induced drying-out session brought on by his well-publicized addiction problems, Saints and Sinners seems almost deliberately low-key.\n\nWith only two compositions of his own--plus another, &quot;Rollin' Cross the Country,&quot; co-written with Dan Hartman, who plays bass, drums, and guitar on the track--Winter runs through a loose collection of rock &amp; roll and blues covers. &quot;Boney Maronie,&quot; the Stones' slinky &quot;Stray Cat Blues,&quot; the Coasters' &quot;Riot in Cell Block #9,&quot; and Allan Toussaint's &quot;Blinded By Love&quot; are fun romps, but Chuck Berry's &quot;Thirty Days&quot; and his own &quot;Bad Luck Situation&quot; seem to allude to Winter's personal life with an unflinching eye. The guitar-and-voice session outtake &quot;Dirty&quot; is added, and it's one of the most harrowing things Winter has ever done.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.&quot;Stone CountyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 3:32\n2.&quot;Blinded By Love&quot;  4:28\n3.&quot;Thirty Days&quot; 3:00\n4.&quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot;  4:15\n5.&quot;Bad Luck Situation&quot; 2:49\n6.&quot;Rollin' 'Cross the Country&quot; - 4:32\n7.&quot;Riot in Cell Block #9&quot; - 3:09\n8.&quot;Hurtin' So Bad&quot; 4:38\n9.&quot;Boney Moronie&quot; 2:37\n10.&quot;Feedback on Highway 101&quot; - 4:24\n11.&quot;Dirty&quot; - 4:00 (prev unreleased)\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohnny Winter - Guitar, harmonica, vocals\nEdgar Winter - Synthesiser, keyboards, alto saxophone, Vocals\nRick Derringer - Synthesiser, bass, guitar\nBobby Caldwell - Percussion\nRandy Jo Hobbs - Bass\nRandy Brecker - Trumpet\nLouis del Gatto - Tenor saxophone\nLani Groves - Vocals\nCarl Hall - Vocals\nDan Hartman - Bass, guitar, drums, vocals\nRichard Hughes - Drums\nBarbara Massey - Vocals\nAlan Rubin - Trumpet\nJohn Smith - Saxophone\nTasha Thomas - Vocals\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7806d8d2013be9ca35bbd9d0ccf849b4da4c5a3b","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter++Saints+and+Sinners%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7806d8d2013be9ca35bbd9d0ccf849b4da4c5a3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,6,216,210,1,59,233,202,53,187,217,208,204,248,73,180,218,76,90,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
