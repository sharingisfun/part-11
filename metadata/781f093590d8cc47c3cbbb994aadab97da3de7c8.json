Smith\nYoung adult novel\nEPUB\n\nEmma Healy has grown used to being the only ordinary one in her rather extraordinary family. But when she finds a birth certificate for a twin brother she never knew she had, along with a death certificate dated just two days later, she realizes why she never felt quite whole. She sets off on a trip to visit her brother's grave. Peter Finnegan, her neighbor, comes along for the ride. Emma thinks they can't possibly have anything in common, but with each passing mile, they find themselves learning more and more about themselves and each other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781f093590d8cc47c3cbbb994aadab97da3de7c8","amp;dn":"You+Are+Here+-+Jennifer+E.+Smith+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781f093590d8cc47c3cbbb994aadab97da3de7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,31,9,53,144,216,204,71,195,203,187,153,74,173,171,151,218,61,231,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
