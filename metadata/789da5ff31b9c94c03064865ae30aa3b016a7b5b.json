After completing the main storyline, players can also go to the Kanto region, similar to the original Gold and Silver.\n\nGameplay: HeartGold and SoulSilver allows a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon that the player owns to follow him or her in-game on the overworld. The player may talk to the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, and occasionally it may pick up certain secret items. A new minigame called the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©thlon has also been introduced. The game utilizes the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon to compete in events such as hurdling.\nThe games are bundled with a peripheral called the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©walker, a pedometer that resembles a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ball which can connect to the Nintendo DS game card via infrared signals (in a fashion similar to another Nintendo DS game Personal Trainer: Walking) and can &quot;hold&quot; a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon. Walking with a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©walker holding a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon increases both its experience and closeness, as well as the player's &quot;watts,&quot; an in-game currency that can be used to catch wild PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon and shop for items.[6][7] Despite the device being included with every game, Nintendo announced that the games would carry standard pricing (around Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥4,800 in Japan).\nHeartGold and SoulSilver can access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and are also fully compatible with PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.\n\n\nI am not the one who translate or patch it.
