For this particular set, I then created the .m4a's from the .wav files to listen to on my iPod.  Similar to my &quot;Tortoise-Derrick Carter&quot; upload, I did this several years ago and originally ripped 128kbps AACs, sorry (to anyone who actually cares)!  If I had access to the original .wav files at the moment I'd make a new 320kbps or lossless rip, unfortunately I do not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78e71e08795e592c0b8b04252c1ff578370061c7","amp;dn":"Mouse+on+Mars+-+Cache+Coeur+Nair+12-inch+%28AAC-128kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78e71e08795e592c0b8b04252c1ff578370061c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,231,30,8,121,94,89,44,11,139,4,37,44,31,245,120,55,0,97,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
