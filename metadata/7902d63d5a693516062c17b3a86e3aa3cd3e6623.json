Now it is my workhorse, it's my first choice always for FTP or FTP/SSH. It is also scriptable.\r\n\r\nTrusted and easy FTP transfer\r\n5 stars by Wildgoosespeeder May 20, 2010 (Read all my 52 reviews)\r\nFileZilla makes FTP simple. I do have one problem with this program and that is the default interface is more complicated than it needs to be. Good thing it's customizable. I don't need the directory trees for both the local site and remote site panes. Also I don't need the message log. Those things just clutter up the display. Otherwise this program is the best for all your FTP needs.\r\n\r\nSets the standard for any other FTP client\r\n5 stars by Jtania73 Mar 21, 2010 (Read all my 8 reviews)\r\nI have been using FileZilla for several years. The most important thing I can say of this software is that it represents &quot;the standard&quot; for any other FTP client, because of its extreme compatibility with any FTP server and with any specific implementation of the FTP protocol. Other than that, it always gives the impression of a stable and well tested program, and it can be also used as a portable application, a thing I really appreciate in any program","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7902d63d5a693516062c17b3a86e3aa3cd3e6623","amp;dn":"FileZilla+3.21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7902d63d5a693516062c17b3a86e3aa3cd3e6623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,2,214,61,90,105,53,22,6,44,23,179,168,110,58,163,205,62,102,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
