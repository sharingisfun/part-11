Now he gives readers the key to a great career, a great workplace, better relationships, and a better world. Stepping Up argues that almost every problem, from personal difficulties and business challenges to social issues, can be solved if all of us look to ourselves to create change rather than looking to others. By seeing ourselves as agents of change we feel happier, less stressed, and more powerful.\nIzzo offers seven compelling principles that enable anyone, anywhere, anytime to effectively bring about positive change. And the book is filled with stories that will inspire you: a middle-aged Italian shopkeeper who fought back against the Mafia, two teenagers who took a stand and ignited an antibullying movement, an executive who turned a dying division into a profit center, and many more. We all have the power to change the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€John Izzo shows us how.\n\n[url]http://www.amazon.com/Stepping-Up-Responsibility-Changes-Everything/dp/1609940571[/url]\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/5f07/adbf7a7e.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7946faaa75717b875a515f07d2696dc93cf0524d","amp;dn":"Stepping+Up+%3A+How+Taking+Responsibility+Changes+Everything+2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7946faaa75717b875a515f07d2696dc93cf0524d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,70,250,170,117,113,123,135,90,81,95,7,210,105,109,201,60,240,82,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
