With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.\n\nLevy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe hacker ethic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that still thrives today. Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.\n\nAbout the Author\nLevy is a senior writer for Wired.
