Michael Straczynski. The show centers on the Babylon 5 space station: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict in the late 2250s and early 2260s. With its prominent use of pre-planned story arcs, the series was often described as a &quot;novel for television.&quot;\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258-2262. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the Battle of the Line).\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: The Gathering is the pilot movie of the science fiction television series Babylon 5. The episode aired on February 22, 1993. The events in &quot;The Gathering&quot; took place approximately one year before the events of the first season.\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: In the Beginning tells the story of a pivotal event in the history of the Babylon 5 universe. Ten years before the television series Babylon 5 is set, a terrible event occurred: Earth became involved in a deadly conflict with the just-discovered Minbari race. This war almost led to the extermination of the human race, but it was mysteriously halted at the last moment by the Minbari leadership for reasons that would remain secret for over a decade. This near-destruction of the human race led to the Earth Alliance creating the Babylon space stations as a means of preventing further wars.\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: Thirdspace deals with an enormous artifact that is discovered in hyperspace and towed to the Babylon 5 station for investigation, at which point the xenoarchaeology organisation Interplanetary Expeditions sends a representative, Dr. Elizabeth Trent (Shari Belafonte), to take control of the examination.\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: The River of Souls - After a short absence from Babylon 5, Michael Garibaldi returns to the station to meet with a person in his employ. An archaeologist in search of a means of immortality brings his most recent find to Babylon 5 - an orb containing one billion souls of an extinct race. Within days a Soul Hunter (played by Martin Sheen) arrives claiming the orb was stolen from his people. With the assistance of the archaeologist the souls break free from their captivity in the orb and bring havoc to the station.\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: A Call to Arms - The movie starts with Mr. Garibaldi meeting President John Sheridan, where they proceed to a space dock where two prototype Victory class destroyers are being built using a combination of Human, Minbari, and Vorlon technology. They tour one of the two vessels, the IAS Excalibur. President Sheridan receives a message purportedly from his wife, Delenn, however the message is actually gibberish and Sheridan stares at the monitor in a catatonic state for 20 minutes.\n\n--\n\nBabylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers - As the Shadow War ended, hundreds of civilizations were devastated. It is up to the Interstellar Alliance, with the help of the Rangers, to rebuild what the great war destroyed and to hold peace among the worlds of the ISA. In the year 2265, David Martel (Dylan Neal), a Ranger, is given the command of a twenty-year-old Ranger starship, the Liandra, and is asked to escort a Valen-class cruiser to a secret location carrying several diplomats, including Ambassador G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas). However, upon arrival, the two craft are attacked on behalf of an unknown, mysterious, and ancient force known only as The Hand whose lethal power is far greater than any previously known to Earth or any other world in the Interstellar Alliance.\n\n\n\n--\n\nGetting all of Babylon 5, use those torrents:\n\nSeason 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 3: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 4: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 5: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovies: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCrusade: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Lost Tales: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--\n\n\nRecommended Watching Order:\n\n(1) The Gathering (Movie #1: Pilot Movie)\n(2) Season 1 - 5\n(3) The other movies\n(4) Crusade\n(5) The Lost Tales\n\n\n--\n\n\nMD5Sums for the ISOs:\n\na49a1bd2867adc43efd761bc382e6606  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES01_THE_GATHERING.iso\ndadfdda767c780e29ea83468ce187009  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES02_IN_THE_BEGINNING.iso\na02ef3f06f71e2a56b1bb6127db6cabd  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES03_THIRD_SPACE.iso\n2448f097ec97ada890a588349b544d29  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES04_RIVER_OF_SOULS.iso\n6b40e900196673d70fe229fbfd67afba  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES05_CALL_TO_ARMS.iso\n0b6c8e7cc73ee95e727fa27f7de38606  BABYLON5_MOVIES_DVDs/MOVIES06_LEGEND_OF_RANGERS.iso\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d83e2b1b638726e181a7dae8a5396954646bc9","amp;dn":"BABYLON+5+-+Movies+DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d83e2b1b638726e181a7dae8a5396954646bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,216,62,43,27,99,135,38,225,129,167,218,232,165,57,105,84,100,107,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
