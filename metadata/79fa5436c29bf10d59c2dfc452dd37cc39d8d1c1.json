Sumerian cuneiform tablets from 3000 BC show a poppy harvest, as do ancient Egyptian scripts and Greek statues adorned with poppy crowns. Far more recently, Freud sung the praises of cocaine, which was included in the original recipe for Coca-Cola. But since the industrial revolution, drug use has changed dramatically, and society's response to this--particularly in America--has been to demonize users and make drugs illegal.\nHOOKED explores the world of illegal drugs, meeting with pharmacologists and scientists to learn exactly what effect they have on us and exploring the social and legislative changes that have transformed (and, some would argue, created) the drug culture of the 20th century. Outspoken advocates on both sides of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; illuminate this polarizing issue, and fascinating accounts and artifacts illustrate the role of drugs throughout history. \nOpium, Morphine, and Heroin\nAn examination of the history of the poppy plant and three of its deadliest derivatives. In ancient times, the poppy was considered divine, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its addicting and lethal qualities caused unprecedented national outrage, social upheaval, and even sparked two wars. Used by the upper classes as patent medicines, heroin became the bane of society when the working class began to use it. In 1914, Federal law banned heroin and opium, and restricted morphine to medicinal use. \n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\nThanks to the peers all over the globe seeding in this collection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fa5436c29bf10d59c2dfc452dd37cc39d8d1c1","amp;dn":"Drugs+Collection+-+HC+-+Illegal+Drugs+-+Opium+Morphine+Heroin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fa5436c29bf10d59c2dfc452dd37cc39d8d1c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,250,84,54,194,155,241,13,89,194,223,196,82,221,55,204,57,216,209,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
