These lessons lead you step by step from birth until the passing over, where the \\&quot;Theater Critics\\&quot; (your own Inner Self) review your past life\\'s performance and decide how to proceed. \n\nChapter 6: The Mind explores the nature of the order of the Universal Mind, the structure of your own mind, the effects of that order upon the structure of the Universe itself. Here is new understanding of how the mind works, from the moment of conception where one is given the breath of life, through each successive stage of development up to the final stage called \\&quot;Death.\\&quot; These stages are each fully described in each lesson and explain association, reflection, logic, and moving beyond identifications and experiential levels into levels of cosmic consciousness. \n\nChapter 7: Harmony shows you how to find balance and harmony in your life through understanding the boundaries, fences, descriptions, rules, laws, confinements, writings, statements, arrangements - all of the agreements which define your and others\\' possessions, rights, responsibilities, duties and freedoms, both here on Earth and on the Inner Planes of existence. Covers all facets of law, as well as Universal Laws and high-level personal contracts that go far beyond three dimensional reality as you know it. \n\nChapter 8: Magic shows you how to perform true Magic. In this incredible series, Cosmic Awareness explains how the universe was created, how the original creators used magic to manifest everything (including planets), how this information was coded into the Bible in secret and how the secret code was unlocked and revealed. (Recently, the book and DVD called \\&quot;The Secret\\&quot; revealed some of this information, but it left out some critical key points that are important for positive results.) This chapter provides step-by-step instructions on how you can create miracles, magic and how to manifest the physical things you want on earth. \n\nChapter 9: Truth explains the true nature of Truth - from every frame of reference.

Delves into the nature of truth, the pursuit of truth and the correct application of truth to help you flourish in your life and help others find happiness. \n\nChapter 10: Structure describes the mind as a builder. The tools of creativity, blueprints, outlines for building, foundations, presentation and packaging and structuring process, classification systems, and balanced agreements with the public in the building process. It explains how alchemy and spiritual growth can satisfy the mental and emotional needs of an individual and follows the mind reaching its highest peak of recognition, going through changes, creating its own undoing, and then moving on to a new creation in a totally different realm.\n\nChapter 11: Value introduces you to \\&quot;The City of Life.\\&quot; It explains what creates true value, the properties of value, the communication of values and prejudices. It outlines the nurturing, expressing, refining and rediscovery of values and how they affect your life and the lives of those around you. \n\nChapter 12: Integration describes the journey of the soul as the Prodigal Son. It explains the essence of the soul, the general movement of the soul toward growth and development, how communication, information, and nourishment of the soul affect the soul\\'s growth.

It ends with a conclusion by Cosmic Awareness summing up the circle of events and the journey of the soul from the beginning of its sojourn, to where it is now and what its ultimate goal is. \n\nThe Appendix lists and explains all of the unalterable Universal Laws.\n\n(This book is available on Amazon.com as a hard-copy physical book, but this e-book is copyright-free.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a53a3c5e6b3f193a89fccf68ab8bc10d0520b18","amp;dn":"Who%2C+In+Fact%2C+You+Really+Are+e-Book+by+Cosmic+Awareness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a53a3c5e6b3f193a89fccf68ab8bc10d0520b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,83,163,197,230,179,241,147,168,159,204,246,138,184,188,16,208,82,11,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
