She argues the Bush administration has already implemented many of these steps. Naomi Wolf is the author of several books, including the ÃƒÂ¢??90s feminist classic, The Beauty Myth.\n\nCritics describe her latest book, The End of America, as a wake-up call to Americans to heed the lessons of history and fight to save their democracy before its too late. \n\n---------------\n\nLibrary Journal 9.15.07 (starred review)\n\nThis latest offering from best-selling author Wolf, The Beauty Myth, is a harbinger of an age that may finally see the patriarchal realm of political discourse usurped. Here is WolfÃƒÂ¢??s compellingly and cogently argued political argument for civil rights, not womenÃƒÂ¢??s rights. She contributes this call to action to a canon that from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes and Locke and forward, with a few exceptions (e.g., Hannah Arendt), has been largely populated by men. WolfÃƒÂ¢??s work is actually closer to the agitated, passionate polemics of Emma Goldman than the ponderous, philosophical musings of Arendt. Readers will appreciate her energy and urgency as she warns we are living through a dangerous &quot;fascist shiftÃƒÂ¢?? brought about by the Bush administration. Her chapters outline the ÃƒÂ¢??Ten Steps to FascismÃƒÂ¢?? citing historical corollaries (as well as the pigs in OrwellÃƒÂ¢??s Animal Farm), with headings like ÃƒÂ¢??Invoke an External and Internal Threat,ÃƒÂ¢?? ÃƒÂ¢??Establish Secret Prisons,ÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??Target Key Individuals.ÃƒÂ¢?? In other words, fascism can exist without dictatorship. Her bookÃƒÂ¢??s publication through a small press in Vermont that is committed to ÃƒÂ¢??the politics and practice of sustainable livingÃƒÂ¢?? rather than through a large trade house is itself a political act. Highly recommended for all collections.\nÃƒÂ¢??Theresa Kintz, Wilkes Univ., Wilkes-Barre, PA\n\nReview\nÃƒÂ¢??You will be shocked and disturbed by this book. Most Americans reject outright any comparison of post 9/11 America with the fascism and totalitarianism of Nazi Germany or PinochetÃƒÂ¢??s Chile. Sadly, the parallels and similarities, what Wolf calls the ÃƒÂ¢??echoesÃƒÂ¢?? between those societies and America today, are all too compelling.ÃƒÂ¢??\nÃƒÂ¢??Michael Ratner, Center for Constitutional Rights\n\n&quot;Naomi Wolf sounds the alarm for all American patriots. We must come together as a nation and recommit ourselves to the fundamental American idea that no president, whether Democrat or Republican, will ever be given unchecked power.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢??Wes Boyd, co-founder, MoveOn.org\n\nÃƒÂ¢??The framers of our Constitution fully understood that it can happen here. Patriots like Madison, Paine, and Franklin would certainly applaud Naomi Wolf and recognize her as a sister in their struggle.ÃƒÂ¢??\nÃƒÂ¢??Mark Crispin Miller, author of Fooled Again\n\n&quot;One of the most important books that&amp;#039;s been written, certainly in the last decade or two, and perhaps in my lifetime.&quot;\n-- Thom Hartmann, best-selling author and host of The Thom Hartmann Radio Program\n\nÃƒÂ¢??Naomi Wolf ÃƒÂ¢??s End of America is a vivid, urgent, mandatory wake-up call that addresses momentous issues of tyranny, democracy, and survival.ÃƒÂ¢??\nÃƒÂ¢??Blanche Wiesen Cook, author of the three-volume Eleanor Roosevelt ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5670d67637d16e04ae9b270d725c43bd54e911","amp;dn":"The+End+of+America+-+Naomi+Wolf+-+mp3+-+DEMOCRACYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5670d67637d16e04ae9b270d725c43bd54e911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,86,112,214,118,55,209,110,4,174,155,39,13,114,92,67,189,84,233,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
