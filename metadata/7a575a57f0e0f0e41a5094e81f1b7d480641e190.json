The trio come together here in these ethereal, hypnotic compositions by Zorn â€“ really meditative music that's way different than the squeaks and squonks of his early years â€“ and which shows this amazing maturation, and a great understanding of the more subtle sides of the sonic spectrum. \r\n\r\nFor this album, the group adds in two harpists and one additional musician on bells and vibes â€“ which only makes the sound more incredible â€“ and titles include &quot;Apocryphon&quot;, &quot;The Divine Word&quot;, &quot;Gnostic Hymn&quot;, &quot;Into The Light&quot;, &quot;Perfect Mind&quot;, and &quot;Providence&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
