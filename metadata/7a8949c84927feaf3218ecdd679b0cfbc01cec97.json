You don't have to be a fan of anything but rock and roll to love this one!).  Enjoy and share - it's another good one!\n\n======================================================\n\nPASSAIC #2 1978 WITH SONG SELECTION MENU!!\n\nLINEAGE: DVD discs from Tailschao - ripped with DVD Decrypter - ABMS\n\nMiles Hai's restored version of Passaic 20. Sept 1978 have now been re-authored by Tailschao, who has made a new main menu and - YES! - a song selection menu of the concert. \nHe did this on my request. Thanks,T!!\n\nMyself, I have adjusted the front artwork that came with Miles Hai's torrent upload: I have only added the credits to MIles Hai and Tailschao, and also indicated the song menu on the front. \n\nPreviously, Tailschao had given the same treatment to the Passaic #1 dvd set, 19.Sept 1978. \n\nEnjoy!\nKajsa89\nFebruary 2009\n\n\nORIGINAL RESEED TORRENT INFO:\n\nThis is a DVD from Bruce and the band's legendary stand at Passaic in September 1978, the second show on the 20th. Miles Hai have done an amazing job and made the footage much more enjoyable and less &quot;grey&quot;/&quot;foggy&quot;. Simply better b/w contrast etc. \nThis restored video is not as good as the restored one from the first show (the 19th), as the footage source was of poorer quality. As a fan, however, you will likely be very much able to sit throug this! \n\nMiles Hai originally uploaded this show in one torrent per disc. I have organized it into a 2-DVD torrent.\n\nCover artwork included. \n\n\nEnjoy!\nI think I've read somewhere that Miles Hai's versions is the best ones around?!!\n- kajsa89, June 2007 \n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS Miles Hai's INFO FILE FROM THE Dime UPLOAD:\n(only the layout with line breaks added by kajsa89)\n\nDVD-R&gt;Toast&gt;Final Cut Express&gt;iMovie&gt;Toast&gt;DVD-R\n\nNTSC - B&amp;W - mono - 170 minutes\n\nVersion from &quot;Passaic Night 2nd Night&quot; DVD remastered in Final Cut Express, adjusting highlights, midtones and blacks camera shot by camera shot (and, when necessary, frame by frame), plus redubbing the audio using the &quot;2nd Night At The Capitol&quot; CDs. \n\nIncludes artwork.\n\nDisc One\nThe First Set\n1. titles\n2.
