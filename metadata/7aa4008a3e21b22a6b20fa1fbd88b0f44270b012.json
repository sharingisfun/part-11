The album was Dylan's third straight (following Time out of Mind and Love and Theft) to be met with nearly universal praise from fans and critics. It continued its predecessors' tendencies toward blues, rockabilly and pre-rock balladry, and was self-produced by Dylan under the pseudonym &quot;Jack Frost&quot;. Along with the acclaim, the album sparked some debate over its uncredited use of choruses and arrangements from older songs, as well as many lyrical lines taken from the work of 19th century poet Henry Timrod.\n\nModern Times became the singer-songwriter's first #1 album in the U.S. since 1976's Desire. It was also his first album to debut at the summit of the Billboard 200, selling 191,933 copies in its first week. At age 65, Dylan became the oldest living \nperson at the time to have an album enter the Billboard charts at number one.[1] It also reached #1 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, debuted #2 in Germany, Austria and Sweden. It reached #3 in the UK and The Netherlands, respectively, and had sold over 4 million copies worldwide in its first two months of release. As with its two studio predecessors, the album's packaging features minimal credits and no lyric sheet.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.  &quot;Thunder on the Mountain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa4008a3e21b22a6b20fa1fbd88b0f44270b012","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Modern+Times+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa4008a3e21b22a6b20fa1fbd88b0f44270b012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,164,0,138,62,33,178,42,107,32,250,31,189,136,176,244,66,112,176,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
