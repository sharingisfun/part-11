Far from it, in fact. While he may be a threat to the status quo, however, the only thing saving him from expulsion is an even greater threat to his country, one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already within our borders.\n\nWith Mexico descending into anarchy, the drug cartels have kicked up the heat, allying with Hezbollah and the Iranian secret service in a plot aimed at nothing less than the destruction of the United States of America. As Teller races to unravel the plot, he discovers that the most dangerous and pernicious enemies are not bloodthirsty drug lords, but a terrifying and treasonous cabal within the U.S. government itself.\n\nFormer military intelligence officer Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer made headlines when his memoir, Operation Dark Heart, faced Department of Defense censorship. Now he returns with The Last Line, an eye-opening thriller rooted in the shadow world of espionage, government power, and betrayal.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nLt. Col. Anthony (Tony) Shaffer (Ret) is a Senior Fellow with both the London Center for Policy Research and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (CADS), and a consultant.\n\nHe is a senior operations officer and Military Operations Training Course (MOTC) graduate with over 29 years of field experience. He has held numerous leadership positions, including as commander of Operating Base (OB) Alpha (Defense Intelligence) and as directing Task Force STRATUS IVY - a unit that conducted cutting edge technology and information operations from the mid 90s through the turn of the century. He has played key roles in multiple interagency operations that were conducted with the NSA, CIA and FBI.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer has led operations from the tactical level, such as defense source operations to protect REFORGER exercises in the 1980s to strategic level, such as STRATUS IVY's direct support mission for Operation ABLE DANGER in the late 1990s. Prior to the consolidation of all Department of Defense (DoD) Human Intelligence resources and operations under DIA in 1995, he was the chief of Army's controlled HUMINT program - overseeing Army Intelligence and Security Command's global controlled HUMINT efforts. He was responsible for combining cutting-edge technology with traditional military operations and intelligence collection to maximize the Department of Defense's ability to detect, monitor and neutralize emerging threats.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer has appeared on Fox News, CNN, and other major TV and radio programs, and has been interviewed by The New York Times and other publications on pre-9/11 operations focused on Al Qaeda. He has testified before Congress on issues relating to 9/11 intelligence and operational failures.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer was awarded the Bronze Star for the first of his two combat tours to Afghanistan. He was credited for conducting highly complex operational support to NSA, and for playing a critical role in breaking the back of a Taliban counteroffensive in the fall of 2003. In addition, he was called back to active duty for DESERT STORM/DESERT SHIELD in 1991 to perform special support to Army Intelligence. He has been deployed to Thailand, Germany and New Zealand to support DoD efforts as an active duty member of the Army in addition to his Afghanistan experience.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer is a 1986 graduate of Wright State University, where he was awarded a BA in Political Science and Environmental Studies who retired from the Army in July 2011, after 30 and a half years of service","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aac0bf0613b3ed28de9fb4ed128ea3cd5b498bb","amp;dn":"The+Last+Line+-+Lt.+Col.+Anthony+Shaffer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aac0bf0613b3ed28de9fb4ed128ea3cd5b498bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,172,11,240,97,59,62,210,141,233,251,78,209,40,234,60,213,180,152,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
