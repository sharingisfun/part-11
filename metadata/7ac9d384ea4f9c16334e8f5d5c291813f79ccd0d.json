You would think that a layoff that long would produce fresher results, but this album is really more of an indication of why it had taken so long -- there's some new material here, but there's also much repetition from previous albums, including childhood memories of his name being &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; talk about his father's flatulence, and more. There's some good new material here, though, including speculation on how the FCC would regulate his mother's threats of violence, ruminations on language, and your new duties when you get married. There's also a hilarious early take on the dentist bit that would later appear on the soundtrack to the film Bill Cosby, Himself. This mixed bag means that Cosby fans won't regret the purchase, but it's by no means essential.\n\nUPLOADERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOTE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bill CosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two 1977 Capitol Records comedy albums (My Father Confused Me &amp; BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Friend) have only ever been released on CD in Australia under the title: The Bill Cosby Comedy Collection. For purists, I have uploaded a FLAC copy of that 2-CD album to this site with proper EAC rip logs. This torrent is each disk FROM that collection released with its appropriate original artwork and Discogs information, as if those albums HAD been released separately as CDs. This makes it easier to assemble a collection of CosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. They are precisely the same (I have the old LPs in my closet), but were not technically released under those titles. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure this matters to SOMEBODY, so I wanted to note that. Additionally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while the comedy here is quite good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whoever did the sound for these albums should be arrested. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard such a butchering. Bits end and leap suddenly into applause at its zenith, which can be quite jarring to the listener.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac9d384ea4f9c16334e8f5d5c291813f79ccd0d","amp;dn":"Bill+Cosby+-+My+Father+Confused+Me%2C+What+Must+I+Do+%5B1977%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac9d384ea4f9c16334e8f5d5c291813f79ccd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,201,211,132,234,79,156,22,51,78,143,93,92,41,24,19,247,156,205,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
