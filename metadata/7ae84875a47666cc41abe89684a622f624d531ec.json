With the traditional Nepalese Buddhist hymn forming the base of the song, layered with a traditional Jordanian melody, and bridged seamlessly with a composition written by A.R.Rahman, this song truly brings together diverse cultures and musical genres. Everything from the background vocals to Sivamani's percussion takes a big leap across musical styles and creates a storm of inspired rhythms, to give this track that extra flavour. This song is completely based around the theme of motherhood, compassion &amp; ultimately happiness.\n\nCredits\n\nComposed &amp; Produced by A.R.Rahman\nLyrics: Traditional Jordanian Lyrics &amp; Hindi Lyrics by Prasoon Joshi\nSingers: Ani Choying Drolma, Farah Siraj\nBacking Vocals: Abhilasha Chellum, Deblina Bose, Kanika Joshi, Prajakta Shukre, Sasha Trupati, Varsha Tripathy, Aditi Pual, Suchi, Rayhanah, Issrath Quadhri\nKeys &amp; Continuum Keyboard: A R Rahman\nPercussion: Sivamani\nGuitar: Prasanna\nGuitar: Keba Jeremiah\nBass: Mohini Dey\nPercussions: KKMC : Kahaan Shah, Yash Pathak, Pradvay Sivashankar, Suyash Medh\nString Section: Carol George, Herald E A, Francis Xavier P D, Vian Pereira\n\nLyrics\n\nTu Zariya, hun main zariya (You're a path, so am I)\nAur uski kirpa, dariya dariya (And His compassion, like an ocean..an ocean)\nHain jo ankhiya nirmal, duniya nirmal (The world is pure, if pure is your vision)\nChalka..chalka, chhal chhal chhal chhal (Brimming o'er, brimming o'er, on and on)\n\nHo zuba koyeebhi (Whichever language, doesn't matter)\nBol dil se tu bol (When from the heart, words you utter)\nYa misri si ho (Like sugar maybe)\nYa shahad si ho (Or even like honey)\n\nAnti al umm (You are the mother)\nAnti il hayaa (You are the life)\nAnti alhob (You are love)\nAnti lee aldunya (You are the world to me)\nAnti lee aldunya (You are the world to me)\n\nTu Zariya, hun mein zariya (You're a path, so am I)\nAur uski kirpa, dariya dariya (And His compassion, like an ocean..an ocean)\nHain jo ankhiya nirmal, duniya nirmal (The world is pure, if pure is your vision)\nChalka..chalka, chhal chhal chhal chhal (Brimming o'er, brimming o'er, on and on)\n\nReedaha, reedaha (I love her, I love her)\nKefima, reedaha (However it may be, I love her)\nTeflatan ya halee (She is a young beauty)\nWil asaal reegaha (In her voice there is honey)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae84875a47666cc41abe89684a622f624d531ec","amp;dn":"Zariya+-+A.R.Rahman%2C+Ani+Choying+%26amp%3B+Farah+Siraj.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae84875a47666cc41abe89684a622f624d531ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,232,72,117,164,118,102,204,65,171,232,150,132,166,34,246,36,213,49,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
