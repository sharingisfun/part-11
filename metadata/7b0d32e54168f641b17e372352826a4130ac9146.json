In this course, updated for 2015, David Gassner shows you how to publish your app on Google Play and provides a brief overview of the alternatives offered by Amazon and other vendors. The process starts with packaging the app for distribution, sideloading an application package (APK) file on your own devices for testing, and implementing some basic protections. Then you'll learn to publish your app on Google Play, where you'll set pricing and track app usage. The final chapter contains information for developers who are also interested in distributing apps through Amazon.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tPackaging an Android app\r\n\tâ€¢\tDistributing through Google vs. Amazon and other app stores\r\n\tâ€¢\tGenerating a signed APK file\r\n\tâ€¢\tTesting the app\r\n\tâ€¢\tProtecting an app with ProGuard\r\n\tâ€¢\tRegistering and publishing apps with Google Play\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding in-app products\r\n\tâ€¢\tTracking app usage and revenue in Google Play\r\n\tâ€¢\tSubmitting an app to Amazon\r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0d32e54168f641b17e372352826a4130ac9146","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Distributing+Android+Apps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0d32e54168f641b17e372352826a4130ac9146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,13,50,229,65,104,246,65,177,126,55,35,82,130,106,65,48,172,145,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
