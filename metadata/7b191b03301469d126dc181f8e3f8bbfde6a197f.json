From the unearthing of Tyrannosaurus Rex to the debate over whether the ancient animals were warm or cold-blooded, our knowledge of dinosaur secrets has progressed by leaps and bounds, driven by the revelations that emerge from the fossil strata.\n\nDINOSAUR SECRETS REVEALED is a comprehensive, feature-length journey through the fascinating world of these extinct giants. Visits to sites where new discoveries are being made show how scientists use fossils to reveal not only what dinosaurs looked like, but how they behaved. And experts trace the turbulent history of paleontology, where new evidence constantly exposes the mistakes of the past and bold theories challenge long-held assumptions.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 1950 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 704 x 512\nAudio Codec: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio BitRate: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 01:30\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1486 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No None on DVD\nSource: DVD\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Dinosaur Planet\n* Prehistoric Park\n* Extreme Dinosaurs\n* Walking with Dinosaurs\n* When Dinosaurs Ruled - The Real Jurassic Park\n* The Truth about Killer Dinosaurs\n* The Mystery of the Jurassic\n* What really killed the Dinosaurs\n\n2) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Dinosaur_Secrets_Revealed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b191b03301469d126dc181f8e3f8bbfde6a197f","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Dinosaur.Secrets.Revealed.Xvid.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b191b03301469d126dc181f8e3f8bbfde6a197f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,25,27,3,48,20,105,209,38,220,24,31,142,63,139,191,222,106,25,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
