No Can Defend is the comedianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second release, first for Comedy Central Records and from the start; the comedian sets the tone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ slightly neurotic, cautious but damn is it funny. Gulman is no newbie to the stand-up scene heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been doing his thing for a long time and No Can Defend is the perfect encapsulation of all that is Gary Gulman.\n\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loved for the underlying neurotic tones to his act but given his childhood \nstories, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to see where they come from. Whether his Jewish upbringing (Ã¢â‚¬Å“theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found themselves in a pickle or twoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or his desire to visit 8th grade Gary and correct his views on the importance of typing; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly in touch with his neuroses and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become a great comedian \nbecause of it.\n\nGulmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style lies somewhere between Jerry Seinfeld and Woody Allen, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call it observational-neurotic. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s applied well to No Can DefendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s which comes off as a roll down Generation X memory lane. Gulman applies hyper-vigilance and skepticism while deconstructing (of all things) the Discman, fonts, MC Hammer, The Karate Kid movies and Vanilla Ice (he never did have the acting career as the IceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cube and T). However, Gulman is too smart to just tell topical, childhood inducing jokes. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whip smart with his deconstruction of said topics. Taking unpopular opinions like Daniel from The Karate Kid really did deserve to get his ass kicked because he was a provoker. Or that Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was being a bitch by singling out her best friends in front of other friends.\n\nOne Gulman characteristic I admire most is the lack of malice in his act. One of the easiest things a comedian can do on stage is go on the attack, whether it be politics or people, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often low hanging fruit available for the laugh. Gulman takes the more difficult route with no anger or hatred toward a topic. Sure he gets fired up about subjects but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not venomous, rather you can feelthe Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe this!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tinge to the joke. Probably the angriest Gulman gets on the album is when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking shots at Blockbuster. While he takes the piss out of the companies exorbitant late fees and Ã¢â‚¬Å“criminally loose definition of Ã¢â‚¬ËœNew ReleasesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you still can tell heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smiling as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing so. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not mean, just delivering fully realized jokes that consistently please. You like \nGary Gulman, you root for him and it allows you to like him even as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ripping something apart. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make the mistake; even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice about it, Gary Gulman is a total killer. A routine that only comes from too many hours of stage time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5f220775e7c482063b491fdfbfc423db797694","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Gary+Gulman+-+No+Can+Defend+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5f220775e7c482063b491fdfbfc423db797694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,95,34,7,117,231,196,130,6,59,73,31,223,191,196,35,219,121,118,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
