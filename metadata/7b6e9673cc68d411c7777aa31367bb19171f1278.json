He moved to New York in 1976, and his early music was performed in No Wave bands of the late 1970s, namely The Static and Theoretical Girls.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he composed several medium-length compositions for electric guitar ensembles, including The Ascension (1981) and Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses (1981). He soon thereafter began composing symphonies for orchestras of electric guitars and percussion, which blended droning industrial cacophany and microtonality with quasi-mysticism and advanced mathematics.\n\nSYMPHONY No.6\nDevil Choirs at the Gates of Heaven 1981\n\nMUSICIANS\nguitars: Jon Bepler, Evans Wohlforth, John Myers, Eric Hubel, Carolyn Master, Phil Kline, Page Hamilton, Ellen Watkins (also keyboard on Fifth Movement), Algis Kizys (also bass).\ndrums; Stephan Wischerth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6e9673cc68d411c7777aa31367bb19171f1278","amp;dn":"Glenn+Branca+-+Symphony+no.+6+%2F+Devil+Choirs+at+the+Gates+of+Hea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b6e9673cc68d411c7777aa31367bb19171f1278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,110,150,115,204,104,212,17,199,119,122,163,19,103,187,25,23,31,18,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
