Rabindranath Thakur,anglicised to Tagore (7 May 1861 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7 August 1941), was a Bengali polymath who reshaped his region's literature and music. Author of Gitanjali and its &quot;profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse&quot;, he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his seemingly mesmeric personality, flowing hair, and otherworldly dress earned him a prophet-like reputation in the West.\n\n Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of modern India.
