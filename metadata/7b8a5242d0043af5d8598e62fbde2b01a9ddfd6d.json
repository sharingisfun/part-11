Before long, he can't pay his bills, and he loses his toehold among Pakistan's cell-phone-toting elite. Daru descends into drugs and dissolution, and, for good measure, he falls in love with the wife of his childhood friend and rival, OziÃ¢â‚¬â€the beautiful, restless Mumtaz.\n\nDesperate to reverse his fortunes, Daru embarks on a career in crime, taking as his partner Murad Badshah, the notorious rickshaw driver, populist, and pirate. When a long-planned heist goes awry, Daru finds himself on trial for a murder he may or may not have committed. The uncertainty of his fate mirrors that of Pakistan itself, hyped on the prospect of becoming a nuclear player even as corruption drains its political will.\n\nFast-paced and unexpected, Moth Smoke portrays a contemporary Pakistan as far more vivid and disturbing than the exoticized images of South Asia familiar to most of the West. This debut novel establishes Mohsin Hamid as a writer of substance and imagination.\n(less)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b8a5242d0043af5d8598e62fbde2b01a9ddfd6d","amp;dn":"Moth+Smoke+-+Mohsin+Hamid.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b8a5242d0043af5d8598e62fbde2b01a9ddfd6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,138,82,66,208,4,58,245,216,89,142,98,251,222,43,1,169,221,253,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
