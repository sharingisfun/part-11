In this edition, Stephen Jay Gould has written a substantial new introduction telling how and why he wrote the book and tracing the subsequent history of the controversy on innateness right through The Bell Curve. Further, he has added five essays on questions of The Bell Curve in particular and on race, racism, and biological determinism in general. These additions strengthen the book's claim to be, as Leo J. Kamin of Princeton University has said, &quot;a major contribution toward deflating pseudo-biological 'explanations' of our present social woes.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bb158b282847c21a0b76f60881ccb4f99d5fc19","amp;dn":"The+mismeasure+of+man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bb158b282847c21a0b76f60881ccb4f99d5fc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,177,88,178,130,132,124,33,160,183,111,96,136,28,203,79,153,213,252,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
