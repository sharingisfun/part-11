He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their \nconstructed lives in a small mockup of the city outside. As the city inside the warehouse grows, \nCaden's own life veers wildly off the tracks. The shadow of his ex-wife Adele, a celebrated painter \nwho left him years ago for Germany's art scene, sneers at him from every corner. Somewhere in Berlin, \nhis daughter Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend, Maria. He's \nhelplessly driving his marriage to actress Claire into the ground. Sammy Barnathan, the actor Caden \nhas hired to play himself within the play, is a bit too perfect for the part, and is making it difficult \nfor Caden to revive his relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel. Meanwhile, his therapist, \nMadeline Gravis, is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counseling him. His is second \ndaughter, Ariel, is disabled. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his \nautonomic functions, one by one. As the years rapidly pass, Caden buries himself deeper into his \nmasterpiece. Populating the cast and crew with doppelgangers, he steadily blurs the line between the \nworld of the play and that of his own deteriorating reality. As he pushes the limits of his relationships, \nboth personally and professionally, a change in creative direction arrives in Millicent Weems, a \ncelebrated theater actress who may offer Caden the break he needs.\n\nCast : \nPhilip Seymour Hoffman ...
