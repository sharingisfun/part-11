Backed up by Oscar Peterson on piano, Herb Ellis on guitar, Ray Brown on bass, and Max Roach on drums.\n\nDizzys fire and Getzs coolness plus Oscars energetic playing all makes for a great listen.\n\nIn 1953 Dizzy Gillespie was at the height of his musical powers, acknowledged as being one of the founders of Bebop with Charlie Parker and ready to take on anybody in a battle of jazz improvisation. He had ideas to spare and a technique that enabled him to play them as he thought of them. \n\nStan Getz had come to fame with the Woody Herman Four Brothers Band, where his solo on Early Autumn remains a jazz legend. At the time of this recording, he was ten years younger that Dizzy, just 26 years of age.\n\nEvery track whether fast, very fast or slow, swings along well and both Stan and Dizzy produce the kind of solos we know they are capable of, full of inspiration and invention.\n\nThe Oscar Peterson Quartet was probably the only rhythm section around at the time, that could have provided what was needed. In Oscars case of course there is always his own solos.\n\nAn excellent album. \n\n\n\nDizzy Gillespie &amp; Stan Getz\n\nDiz and Getz 1955\n\n\nCD / Verve / 2001 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n \n\nTracklist\n1 It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) \t\n2 I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart \t\n3 Exactly Like You \t\n4 It's The Talk Of The Town \t\n5 Impromptu \t\n6 One Alone \t\n7 Girl Of My Dreams \t\n8 Siboney (Parts 1 And 2) \n\t\n\nTracks # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 recorded at Radio Recorders, Hollywood, CA, December 9, 1953\n\nMusicians:\nDizzy Gillespie, Trumpet and Stan Getz, Tenor sax\nwith The Oscar Peterson Quartet:\nOscar Petersen, Piano\nRay Brown, Bass\nHerb Ellis, Guitar\nMax Roach, Drums\n\nTrack #7 recorded at Fine Sound Studios, NYC, May 25, 1954\n\nMusicians:\nDizzy Gillespie, trumpet\nHank Mobley, tenor saxophone\nWade Legge, piano\nLou Hackney, bass\nCharlie Persip, drums\n\n\n\nAt 320Kbps for you, Sir or Madam\nStraight, no chaser\n:)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf448afbd16525a80eae649399fe221fe19ea5a","amp;dn":"Dizzy+Gillespie+%26amp%3B+Stan+Getz+-+Diz+and+Getz+1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf448afbd16525a80eae649399fe221fe19ea5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,244,72,175,189,22,82,90,128,234,230,73,57,159,226,33,254,25,234,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
