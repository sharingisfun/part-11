Voice acting was still sort of a new thing for games, and I was surprised to find that all major dialogue, if not all, was voice acted in a way that would live up to today&amp;#039;s standards.\n\nThe controls are similar to Resident Evil or Silent Hill, which annoys me a lot but you get used to it.  The idea that you could merge monsters and actually have them change appearance was revolutionary for it&amp;#039;s time, especially on a platform like the 32-bit playstation.\n\nThe game can be very long or very short, depending on how you want to play it.  I always made an effort to build up my minions as strong as they could be.  And damn they look cool.\n\nA very cool, underated game that&amp;#039;s incredibly hard to find nowadays, even on torrent sites.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1c5a9b9e4bf3f78a4b04a0a4a710be6e77602c","amp;dn":"Jade+Cocoon+-+Story+of+the+Tamamayu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1c5a9b9e4bf3f78a4b04a0a4a710be6e77602c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,28,90,155,158,75,243,247,138,75,4,160,164,167,16,190,110,119,96,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
