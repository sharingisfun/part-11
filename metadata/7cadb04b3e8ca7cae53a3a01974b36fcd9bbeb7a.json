Jack deeply loves his wife May (Played by Sherrie \nHewson in the pilot episode which was re-recorded with Julia \nDeakin taking over the role) who runs the station buffet, \nbut is prone to becoming very jealous of her around other \nmen. Without a station master the station has become rather \ndisorganised, for instance the eternally miserable signalman, \nHarry Lambert (Stephen Lewis), is so underworked that he is \nrunning several sidelines from his signalbox - including \nhair-cutting, selling fruit and vegetables, repairing bicycles, \nand taking bets - seeing his signaling duties as a distraction- \nhe frequently speaks of &quot;ruddy trains&quot;. The station is part-run\nby the eccentric, easily flustered booking clerk, \nEthel Schumann (Su Pollard), who is always on the lookout for \na new man in her life, and whose grown-up son Wilfred \n(Paul Aspen), the product of a relationship with a now deceased\nAmerican soldier during the war, is the station dogsbody. \nWilfred often comes across as stupid, but sometimes displays \nsigns that he is brighter than he appears- for instance, in \nthe episode &quot;The Van&quot;, he finds Arnold's missing wife, Jessica.\n\nAlso present are Vera Plumtree, (Barbara New), who has no \nparticular role, but seems to do various jobs around the station, \nand acts as Mr. Parkin's housekeeper. Her late husband used to work \non the railway, as she frequently reminds the other members of staff, \n(her catchphrase is, &quot;he was an engine driver, you know&quot;). She \nalways muddles her words (Ethel also sometimes muddles her words, \nbut not as often), and has an unrequited love for Harry (who always \nignores her advances); Gloria (Lindsay Grimshaw), Jack and MayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \npretty teenage daughter, who loves wearing short skirts, much to the \nchagrin of the father. She shows an interest in men, but Jack is \nover-protective, and won't let any man take her out; the elderly \nengine driver, Arnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts); his inexperienced \nfireman, Ralph (Perry Benson), who is training to be a driver; \nthe flirtatious guard, Percy (Terry John), with whom Ethel appears \nto be quite besotted at times. He returns her advances, but seems \nto prefer Gloria's friend, Amy Matlock (Tara Daniels), who appears \nin most episodes, albeit usually briefly. Richard Spendlove, \nthe director, also appeared in several episodes as Mr. Orkindale, \nthe strait-laced director of the railway.\n\nSoon the new station master arrives in the guise of Cecil Parkin \n(Jeffrey Holland), a stern, well spoken man. He is amazed to learn \nthat the cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is run by May (then called Blanchflower), with whom \nhe had a passionate fling during the war before she married Jack- \nalthough we later learn that she was seeing both of them at the same \ntime. Although Jack is in the dark as to May and Cecil's history, \nhe takes an instant dislike to the new station master. A running \nsubplot to the series is the question over whether Gloria is \nactually Jack and MayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter, or a result of May's fling with \nCecil (although in the second series episode &quot;Father's Day&quot;, it is \ngenerally concluded that Jack is her father). Meanwhile, at the end \n\nof the episode a newspaper article is found threatening the station \nwith closure under the Beeching Axe, which begins the series.\n\nA running gag in the series was Vera almost finding out about Cecil \nand May's relationship. Mr. Parkin steals every moment he possibly \ncan with May, often sneaking into the kitchen near the beginning of \nthe day, before anyone else has arrived.\n\nThe original pilot later had sections re-filmed, with Julia Deakin \nreplacing Sherrie Hewson as May, and shown as the first episode in \nthe regular run.\n\nThe programme ran for two series, although the final episode did not \nconclude by answering whether the station was closed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cadb04b3e8ca7cae53a3a01974b36fcd9bbeb7a","amp;dn":"Oh+Dr+Beeching+%28hi-De-Hi+Gang%29+Series+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cadb04b3e8ca7cae53a3a01974b36fcd9bbeb7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,173,176,75,62,140,167,202,229,58,58,1,151,75,54,252,217,187,235,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
