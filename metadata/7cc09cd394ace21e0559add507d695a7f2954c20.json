Boldly transforming documentary into fiction, Liu Jiayin cast her parents and herself as fictionalized versions of themselves. Her father, Liu Zaiping, sells leather bags but is slowly going bankrupt. He argues with his wife, Jia Huifen, and his daughter over methods to boost business in the shop. A cloud of anxiety follows them into sleepless nights shared in the same bed. But through the thousand daily travails of city life, a genuine and deeply moving picture of Chinese familial solidarity emerges from the screen. With virtually no budget and boundless ingenuity, Liu Jiayin's eye-opening debut, shot when she was 23 years old, consists of twenty-three static, one-scene shots within her family's fifty square meter home.\n\n______________________________________\n\n\nDVDRIP\n\nFile Name .........................................: OXHIDE.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,490,204,672 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:49:24\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x288 (AR: 2.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1614 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.348 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc09cd394ace21e0559add507d695a7f2954c20","amp;dn":"Oxhide+%28Jiayin+Liu%2C+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc09cd394ace21e0559add507d695a7f2954c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,192,156,211,148,172,226,30,5,89,173,213,7,214,149,167,242,149,76,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
