The first part of the book discusses the development of the process together with its advantages and disadvantages in comparison with thermal spray coating techniques. Part 2 reviews key process parameters such as powders, nozzle design, particle temperature and velocity, and particle/substrate interaction. It also describes portable and stationary cold spray systems. The final part of the book discusses how the cold spray process can be applied in such areas as improved wear, corrosion protection, electromagnetic interference shielding and repair of damaged components.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1fecf19e8d294cd7a18470350af7b3dbe6632e","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2007%5D+The+Cold+Spray+Materials+Deposition+Process+Fundame","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1fecf19e8d294cd7a18470350af7b3dbe6632e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,31,236,241,158,141,41,76,215,161,132,112,53,10,247,179,219,230,99,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
