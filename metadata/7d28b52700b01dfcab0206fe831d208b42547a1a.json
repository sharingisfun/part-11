Today, the siblings both have illustrious careers in the culinary worldÃ¢â‚¬â€writing cookbooks, running restaurants, hosting television showsÃ¢â‚¬â€and yet they are still faced with the question that many of us encounter in the kitchen every day: how can we enjoy the pasta that we crave in a healthy and satisfying way? \nHere, the brother and sister have paired up to give us that answer in 100 recipes, each under 500 calories per serving, that are as good for you as they are delectable. This wonderfully informative, easy-to-use cookbook provides simple ways to make pasta an integral part of a healthy and well-balanced lifestyle, even if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gluten-free. \nDo not be fooled: this is not a diet book. There are no tricks and no punishing regimensÃ¢â‚¬â€it is just a simple guide to enjoying more of the food you love in ways that are good for you. Using ingredients and cooking methods that maximize taste but minimize fat content, Joe and Tanya will teach you what different grains mean to your diet, how to pair particular grains with sauces, why better-quality pasta is healthier for you, the health benefits of cooking pasta al dente, and how to reduce fat and calories in your sauces. \nThe recipes consist of regular, whole-grain, and gluten-free pastas, including classics like Spaghetti with Turkey Meatballs and Linguine with Shrimp and Lemon, as well as new combinations like Gnocchi with Lentils, Onions, and Spinach; Bucatini with Broccoli Walnut Pesto; Summer Couscous Salad with Crunchy Vegetables; Spaghetti and Onion Frittata; and many more. All under 500 calories! This book will revolutionize the way you think about pasta.
