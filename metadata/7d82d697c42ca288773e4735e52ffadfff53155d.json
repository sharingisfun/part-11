It has atmosphere.  Lots of it.\n\nThe riverfront world of the novel has been beautifully captured.  The models are exquisitely tailored and dressed, the homes filled with implements, knick-knacks, artworks and paraphenelia scaled down to minute proportions, the countryside rich with a variety of flora and fauna.\n\nThe classic story of the adventures of Mole, Badger, Rat and Toad of Toad Hall, set in Edwardian England of 1908 (when Kenneth Grahame published the original book).\n\n\n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d82d697c42ca288773e4735e52ffadfff53155d","amp;dn":"The+Wind+in+the+Willows%5B1983%5DDvDrip%5B720x576%5DAC3%5B2ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d82d697c42ca288773e4735e52ffadfff53155d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,130,214,151,196,44,162,136,119,62,71,53,229,47,250,223,255,83,21,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
