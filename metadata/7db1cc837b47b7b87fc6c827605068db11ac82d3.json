They cannot be burned to a CD, nor a regular DVD-V (DVD video). They can only be nurned to a DVD-Audio disc.\nI don't know of any freeware programs that can do this.\n\nOne shareware program that can do this is Cirlinca DVD-Audio Solo.\nwww.cirlinca.com\nit costs $44.95 to register. \n\nThe flac files can also be played with media players such as Foobar2000.\n\n\n*** following info is for 24/96 files***\n\nThere are many free media players that can play 24bit 96khz flac files. I use Foobar2000. Winamp and VLC can also play them. \nTo play flacs in iTunes, try Fluke: http://blowintopieces.com/blog/2008/05/15/fluke-play-flacs-in-itunes/\nor just convert to Apple lossless with XLD.\n\nYou can also burn these to a DVDR disc, which will play in your standalone DVD player.\n\nThe only freeware program I know of that does this is Lplex. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/audioplex/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/audioplex/&lt;/a&gt;\nIt authors a DVD-Video disc (with a blank picture) with the 24/96 LPCM audio.\nIt's easy to use and works. Although it works with flacs, with 24/96 flac files, you may need to decode to wav first. After processing, you will end up with an .ISO file and/or a VIDEO_TS folder, either of which can be burned with burning software (I use IMGBurn). The only config setting you may need to change is the PAL/NTSC setting, if your player only plays PAL discs. (It defaults to NTSC). It defaults to gapless playback.\n\nAnother good program is DVD Audio Solo. &lt;a href=&quot; http://cirlinca.com/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://cirlinca.com/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\nIt can author a DVD video (with blank screen) or a &quot;DVD-Audio&quot; disc (need a DVD-Audio player to play those) with 24/96 LPCM audio. It's shareware and comes with a free trial and costs $45 to register.\n\nIf you want to burn to a regular CD-R, the files will have to be converted to 16-bit and 44.1khz. This can be done easily with an application like Foobar (right click on each file, and select convert). For better quality resampling and dithering, use a program like Izotope RX Advanced or Soundforge 10.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db1cc837b47b7b87fc6c827605068db11ac82d3","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Bitches+Brew+%281970%29+%5BVinyl%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db1cc837b47b7b87fc6c827605068db11ac82d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,177,204,131,123,71,183,184,127,198,200,39,96,80,104,219,17,172,130,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
