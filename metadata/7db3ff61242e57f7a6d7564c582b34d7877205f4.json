Avoiding any one genre, the music\n   they play is best described as heartfelt. Call it rock, punk, blues, folk,\n   whatever, they do it well. They are easily and favorably compared with\n   Against Me! and, at least for me, brought The Lawrence Arms to mind. Though\n   'Blue Jeans &amp; White T-Shirts' reflects some definite John Mellencamp\n   influences. SeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±or and the Queen brings four songs that don't sound similar,\n   but somehow manage to convey a common theme. Raw, powerful, and brutally\n   honest, the buzz building around this band is well deserved.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
