Pitched at a level accessible to beginning graduate students and researchers from applied disciplines, it is both a course book and a rich resource for individual readers. Subjects covered include Brownian motion, stochastic calculus, stochastic differential equations, Markov processes, weak convergence of processes and semigroup theory. Applications include the Black-Scholes formula for the pricing of derivatives in financial mathematics, the Kalman-Bucy filter used in the US space program and also theoretical applications to partial differential equations and analysis. Short, readable chapters aim for clarity rather than full generality. More than 350 exercises are included to help readers put their new-found knowledge to the test and to prepare them for tackling the research literature.\n\n\nHardcover: 406 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (November 28, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 110700800X\nISBN-13: 978-1107008007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db8d9f491110e7f3c3b3ff69444422dfecf2262","amp;dn":"Stochastic+Processes+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db8d9f491110e7f3c3b3ff69444422dfecf2262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,184,217,244,145,17,14,127,60,59,63,246,148,68,66,45,254,207,34,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
