Other highlights of this collection include the emotive &quot;Wet Sand&quot; and the frenetic &quot;Torture Me,&quot; which provide nice counterpoints to loose, limber tunes such as the funk workouts &quot;Hump De Bump&quot; and &quot;C'mon Girl.&quot; In many ways a culmination of the Chili Peppers' decades-spanning musical evolution, STADIUM ARCADIUM stands as one of the group's most impressive efforts.\n\n\n----------Track listing----------\n\nCD1 - JUPITER\n\n01 - Dani california [04:42] \n02 - Snow ((hey oh)) [05:34] \n03 - Charlie [04:37] \n04 - Stadium arcadium [05:15] \n05 - Hump de bump [03:33] \n06 - She's only 18 [03:25] \n07 - Slow cheetah [05:19] \n08 - Torture me [03:44] \n09 - Strip my mind [04:19] \n10 - Especially in michigan [04:01] \n11 - Warlocks [03:25] \n12 - C'mon girl [03:48] \n13 - Wet sand [05:09] \n14 - Hey [05:39] \n\nCD2 - MARS\n\n01 - Desecration smile [05:01] \n02 - Tell me baby [04:07] \n03 - Hard to concentrate [04:02] \n04 - 21st century [04:22] \n05 - She looks to me [04:06] \n06 - Readymade [04:30] \n07 - If [02:52] \n08 - Make you feel better [03:51] \n09 - Animal bar [05:25] \n10 - So match I [03:44] \n11 - Storm in A teacup [03:45] \n12 - We believe [03:36] \n13 - Turn it again [06:06] \n14 - Death of A martian [04:25]\n\n\nENJOY \nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dbf15498b7b89a398088dece9bb0b86997b1831","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+Stadium+Arcadium+%5B2006+-+MP3+-+320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dbf15498b7b89a398088dece9bb0b86997b1831","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,191,21,73,139,123,137,163,152,8,141,236,233,187,11,134,153,123,24,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
