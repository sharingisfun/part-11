Foxworthy&amp;#039;s in-laws, wife, and kids are a source of endless problems and amusement, creating familiar scenarios everyone can laugh at whether they have a Southern background or not. The huge gulf between male and female methods of communication (&quot;I know what women want, they want to talk&quot;), the dangers of taking the kids down the cereal aisle at the supermarket, and the ever-lurking toilet paper shortage are but a few of the &quot;joys&quot; of married life he good-naturedly skewers. Foxworthy also does a few virtuoso vocal bits on language, mimicking the typical stock-car driver&amp;#039;s unintelligible remarks after a race (in &quot;Jeff Gordon Enunciates&quot;) and, of course, a few more examples of what it takes to be a redneck, his most famous routine. --Wally Shoup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dda32261f412dbb3abadeb13af80e50f807f93a","amp;dn":"Jeff+Foxworthy+-+Big+Funny+Full+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dda32261f412dbb3abadeb13af80e50f807f93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,218,50,38,31,65,45,187,58,186,222,177,58,248,14,80,248,7,249,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
