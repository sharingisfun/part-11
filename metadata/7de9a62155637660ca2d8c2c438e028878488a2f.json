Arguing that Stalin was a hands-on director of expanding the Communist domain from 1939 to 1953, Gellately points to StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideological convictions as the driving motive in his political decisions, contrasting them with his mollifying arguments to Western diplomats about RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reasonable needs for security. The ground-level ramifications were, as Gellately recounts, police-state suppression of freedom and abolition of capitalism through executions, deportations, and gulags, which claimed victims by the millions. Amid his inventory of countries subjected to StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule, Gellately credits the Red dictator with political acumen in deceiving Western leaders about his true objective of imposing one-party states. StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Communist associates and acolytes knew better, and the archives preserve their orders from Stalin about local tactics for eradicating non-Communist opposition and, in Korea, starting a war. Thoroughly researched, GellatelyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine contribution to Cold War studies will engage readers with its inside-the-Kremlin detail. -\n\n496 pages\nPublisher: Knopf (March 5, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307269159\nISBN-13: 978-0307269157","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de9a62155637660ca2d8c2c438e028878488a2f","amp;dn":"Stalin%27s+Curse%3A+Battling+for+Communism+in+War+and+Cold+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de9a62155637660ca2d8c2c438e028878488a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,233,166,33,85,99,118,96,202,45,140,44,67,142,2,136,120,72,138,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
