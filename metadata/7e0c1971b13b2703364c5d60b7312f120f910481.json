Following on the heels of GoddardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hot-selling how-to book, The Wonder of Knifemaking, this new book expands on information from GoddardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s popular column in Blade magazine to show knifemakers of all skill levels how to create helpful gadgets and supply their shop on a shoestring. \nThis book is well illustrated with great photos and detailed diagrams showing the design and construction of all the tools needed to make knives. Every knifemaker will want to learn how Goddard can create or acquire knifemaking supplies at almost no cost. \nPractical tips for low-cost supplies\nHome-built heat-treating equipment\nCreating a knifemakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anvil \n\n\n########################################################################\n\nComments:\n\nHe has a good simple get 'er done approach to equipping a knife shop with scrounged and recycled materials to build workshop equipment.\n\nHe stresses forging, which is interesting, but simple stock removal is where most makers would start.\n\nAlthough this book is extremely popular for the beginner,\n(It has a great title)\nI find that it causes a lot of confusion for the beginner on a few points.\n \n1.   Cable damascus is certainly interesting, but not a beginners project.\n\n2.   His use of scrap yard steels is a fun approach, but the unknown identity of the steel means that the proper heat treating method is not known.  A very experienced smith can use his skill and experience to make a judgement, but that is not for the beginner the book is aimed at. Forget about saw and lawnmower blades, good quality proper steel is cheap.\n\n3.   His use of homemade solid quenchant made of bacon grease, wax and automotive oil is not suitable.  \nProper commercial quenchants are available with different quench speeds and should be matched to the steel type used. \n\nThe books by Jim Hrisoulas have better information, but this book is inexpensive, widely sold in a lot of stores and popular for getting many started. \n\n#########################################################################\n\n********************************************************\nThis info is brought to you by:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/KnifemakerC/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/KnifemakerC/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPositive comments and thanks are appreciated.  \nIt's my only payoff for all the time and money spent here.\n\n\nDemonoid members may PM related requests and interesting finds\nto account    LurkerLurker     (unable to post the link here)\n\n\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    #### \n\n********************************************************\n\nTags\naustenite forging, subzero quench, vasco wear, braze rod, flat grind, grit marks, hardy hole, hot chisel, grind lines, belt grinder, temper line, anvil surface, surrounding strands, carbon migration, cross peen, final grind, grip material, green coal, hollow grind, welding temperature, pattern welding, first weld, blade cool, rough grinding, weld surfaces, Heat treat\n\nWayne Goddard, Sword, Blade, Blades, knifemaker, knife, Make a Knife, video, stock removal, Metalwork, Steel, Tool Steel, Craft, Hobby craft, Heat Treat, Bowie, Daggar, Dagger, tpb knifemaking, tpb knife, tpb blade, tpb knifemaker, knifemaking torrent, knife torrent, bladesmith torrent, forge torrent, make a knife torrent, torrent, blade torrent, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0c1971b13b2703364c5d60b7312f120f910481","amp;dn":"Wayne+Goddard+s+-+50+Dollar+Knife+Shop+-+Original+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0c1971b13b2703364c5d60b7312f120f910481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,12,25,113,177,59,39,3,54,76,93,96,183,49,47,18,15,145,4,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
