He was born in Havana, Cuba. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, won several Grammy Awards, and has been described as &quot;the inventor of the mambo&quot;.\n\nHe was, in his last years, the most important living figure in Cuban music, on or off the island. And according to Cuban-music historian Ned Sublette he was &quot;arguably the most important bassist in twentieth-century popular music&quot;, innovating not only Cuban music but also influencing the now familiar bass lines of American R&amp;B, &quot;which have become such a part of the environment that we don't even think where they came from&quot;.\n\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez played the acoustic bass with his late brother, multi-instrumentalist Orestes LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez. The brothers composed literally thousands of songs together and were heavily influential on Cuban music from the 1930s to the 1950s. They introduced the nuevo ritmo (&quot;new rhythm&quot;) in the late 1930s, which transformed the danzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n by introducing African rhythms into Cuban music, which led to mambo.\n\nCachao has played with artists such as Celia Cruz, Bebo Valdes, Tito Puente, Willy Chirino, Paquito D'Rivera, Willie Colon, and his music has been featured on movies such as The Birdcage, and on the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack. Actor Andy Garcia produced two documentaries about this music, Cachao ... Como Su Ritmo No Hay Dos (&quot;With A Rhythm Like No Other&quot;) (1993) and Cachao: Uno MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, which premiered in April 2008 at the San Francisco International Film Festival. The inspiration for Cachao: Uno MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, made by San Francisco State University's DOC Film Institute, came largely from from a concert Cachao played at Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco, and the film's premiere was followed by a tribute concert with the John Santos Band at Yoshi's Jazz Club SF. Lopez died on the morning of March 22, 2008 in Coral Gables, Florida at the age of 89.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
