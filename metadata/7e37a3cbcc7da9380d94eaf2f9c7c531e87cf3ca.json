This is because it is the only recording of the edition of Richard Maunder whose idea was to excise all contributions to the work by Sussmayr. Thus, the Sanctus and the Benedictus are removed entirely, and there are numerous other emendations. Hogwood uses boys instead of women for the soprano and alto parts, since females did not perform in church choirs during Mozart's day.\n\nThe soloists are as follows:\n\nEmma Kirkby (soprano), Carolyn Watkinson (contralto), Anthony Rolfe-Johnson (tenor), and David Thomas (bass).\n\nThe recording was released by L'Oiseau-Lyre in 1984.\n\n(I remember buying it in a RECORD store in the late 1980s).\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e37a3cbcc7da9380d94eaf2f9c7c531e87cf3ca","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Requiem+-+Hogwood%2C+AAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e37a3cbcc7da9380d94eaf2f9c7c531e87cf3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,55,163,203,204,125,169,56,13,148,234,242,249,199,197,49,232,124,243,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
