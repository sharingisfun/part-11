Starting as a copy of the western tom-and-jerry-type cartoons, the series soon took a direction of its own. You'll enjoy it more if you can understand the cultural background and recognize some of the popular soviet music used - but it's by all means not a must.\n\n\nThe cartoons are in Russian only, with no subtitles or alternate language feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb6cb658596aba6ad3ae4d15610fdb7fed17ad0","amp;dn":"Nu+Pogodi+%5BRussian+Cartoons%5D+-+All+18+Series%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb6cb658596aba6ad3ae4d15610fdb7fed17ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,182,203,101,133,150,171,166,173,58,228,209,86,16,253,183,254,209,122,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
