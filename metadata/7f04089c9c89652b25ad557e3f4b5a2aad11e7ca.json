Matt was seemingly investigating the death of another band member John Gaunt, \nover thirty years earlier, which at the time appeared to have been an accident.\n\nI hope you enjoy.\n\n\nTechnical Ep1 (Ep2, Ep3 &amp; Ep4 Similar):\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : DCI Banks S04 RB58DCI Banks S04E01 Wednesdays Child pt 1 RB58.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 387 MiB\nDuration : 45mn 15s\nOverall bit rate : 1 196 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L4\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 4\nDuration : 45mn 15s\nBit rate : 1 055 Kbps\nWidth : 704 pixels\nHeight : 396 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.151\nStream size : 341 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 64\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 45mn 14s\nSource duration : 45mn 14s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 41.4 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f04089c9c89652b25ad557e3f4b5a2aad11e7ca","amp;dn":"DCI+Banks+S04E01+-+E04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f04089c9c89652b25ad557e3f4b5a2aad11e7ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,4,8,156,156,137,101,43,37,173,85,126,63,75,90,42,173,17,231,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
