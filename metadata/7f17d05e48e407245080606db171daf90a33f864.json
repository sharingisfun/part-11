While there's no denying his exceptional talent on the six-string, his knack for penning arena rock anthems, or his standing as one of rock's top live acts, it's his non-musical endeavors that have caused the most condemnation from his detractors (his pro-right wing beliefs, pro-gun advocacy, appreciation of hunting animals, etc.). But by the same token, Nugent is a family man and one of the few hard rockers who has admirably stuck by his lifelong anti-drugs and -drink stance throughout his career.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Baby Please Don't Go\n02.Journey To The Center Of Your Mind\n03.You Talk Sunshine I Breathe Fire (Mono)\n04.Gloria\n05.Call Of The Wild\n06.Great White Buffalo\n07.Stranglehold\n08.Stormtroopin'\n09.Hey Baby\n10.Motor City Madhouse\n11.Free-For-All\n12.Dog Eat Dog\n13.Turn It Up\n14.Street Rats\n15.Magic Party\n16.Hammerdown\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Cat Scratch Fever\n02.Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\n03.Live It Up\n04.Homebound\n05.Out Of Control\n06.Oh Carol (Live)\n07.Just What The Doctor Ordered (Live)\n08.Yank Me Crank Me (Live)\n09.Walking Tall (Live)\n10.Need You Bad\n11.Weekend Warriors\n12.Paralyzed\n13.State Of Shock\n14.Wango Tango\n15.Scream Dream\n16.Terminus Eldorado\n17.Jailbait (Live)\n18.Little Miss Dangerous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
