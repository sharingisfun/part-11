In it a protagonist, known only as K., strives to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle that governs the village where K. has arrived to work as a land surveyor. Dark and at times surreal, The Castle is about alienation, bureaucracy, and the seemingly endless frustrations of man&amp;#039;s attempts to stand against the system.\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9763e8898c7ee8635c591254d6357a16e3984c","amp;dn":"Franz+Kafka+-+The+Castle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9763e8898c7ee8635c591254d6357a16e3984c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,151,99,232,137,140,126,232,99,92,89,18,84,214,53,122,22,227,152,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
