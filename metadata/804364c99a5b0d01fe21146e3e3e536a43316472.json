Legacy/Epic/Caribou records has just issued a two disc set re-mixed and includes the &quot;unfinished&quot; tracks from &quot;Bambu&quot;.\n\nI submit the original CD version of POB and the boot version of Bambu.\nIf you like Dennis&amp;#039;s work support his memory by grabbing a copy of the new 2 disc issue with new photos and essays.
