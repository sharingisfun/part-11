His renditions have a strong distinguishing feature: they are slow and massive in order to achieve an overwhelming tension and drama - far from hysterical and nervous interpretations that were more in vogue in the second half of the XXth century.\r\nThe casting is lavish, between Birgit Nilsson in her prime and Gottlob Frick with his bass voice incredibly dark and deep.\r\nThe sound is okay thanks to Orfeo remastering: really not bad for a live recording from 1955, but saturate easily when too loud.\r\n\r\n* Technicals \r\nTotal duration - 04h 23m 01s\r\nAverage bitrate - 364 kbps\r\nEncoder - FLAC 1.3.1, lossless, compression level 5\r\n\r\n\r\n* Tracks\r\nToo long to list here, please see: http://www.allmusic.com/performance/die-g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-twilight-of-the-gods-opera-wwv-86d-mq0000367410\r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Caudheur's Classical Catalog (CCC)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty decent collection of classical music, encoded in lossless format (FLAC).\r\n\r\nI will start to upload as much as I can, because I believe great works of art should be shared for all mankind  :)\r\n\r\nYou can visit my catalogue here:   \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Caudheur-s-Classical-Catalog-Classical-Music-Rarities\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you a pleasant listening, and don't forget to seed so that Music lives on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805a666183a677c6f69bdc7845d1969e9bcdaf74","amp;dn":"Wagner+-+Gotterdammerung+-+Knappertsbusch+%281955%2C+Orfeo%29+%5B4CDs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805a666183a677c6f69bdc7845d1969e9bcdaf74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,90,102,97,131,166,119,198,246,155,220,120,69,209,150,158,155,205,175,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
