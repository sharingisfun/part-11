This single-season sitcom, originally aired in the fall/winter of 1977-1978 , revolves around the young adult Tabitha (the daughter from the earlier Bewitched series, who appears to have aged rather quickly to be an adult!) in her work life at a broadcast TV station.\n\nInstead of a husband/wife dynamic like Bewitched, the series writers attempted a similar relationship (a young female witch is encouraged to not use her magic by her non-magic male partner) as brother/sister. Seems a little creepy to have a brother and sister parroting a husband and wife, but it was important to keep Tabitha single. Why?\n\nMore than anything, this series seemed to be an attempt to clone the success of The Mary Tyler Moore Show: a young, single woman on her own in the working world. Hard to imagine now, but this was considered evolutionary in the 1970s, so it's hard to fault the creators of Tabitha for attempting to tap into that zeitgeist.\n\nAlso included in this torrent is the original 1976 pilot Tabatha.\n\nEpisodes are listed below in original broadcast order, and the files titled with both order position and episode title.\n\n0 &quot;Tabatha&quot; (Pilot #1) April 24, 1976\n1 &quot;Tabitha&quot; (Pilot #2) May 7, 1977\n2 &quot;Tabitha's Weighty Problem&quot; September 10, 1977\n3 &quot;Halloween Show&quot; November 12, 1977\n4 &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; November 19, 1977\n5 &quot;Minerva Goes Straight&quot; November 26, 1977\n6 &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; December 10, 1977\n7 &quot;The Arrival of Nancy&quot; December 17, 1977\n8 &quot;Tabitha's Triangle&quot; December 24, 1977\n9 &quot;That New Black Magic&quot; December 31, 1977\n10 &quot;What's Wrong with Mister Right?&quot; December 31, 1977\n11 &quot;Paul Goes to New York&quot; January 7, 1978\n12 &quot;Tabitha's Party&quot; January 14, 1978\n\nSeeding on basic DSL, and the complete series is a little over 3 gigs, so please allow ample time for this to be fully seeded.
