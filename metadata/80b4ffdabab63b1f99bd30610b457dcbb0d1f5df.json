It starts with an in-depth explanation of the background and standardization process before moving on to examine the system architecture evolution (SAE). The basics of air interface modulation choices are introduced and key subjects such as 3GPP LTE physical layer and protocol solutions are described. Mobility aspects and radio resource management together with radio and end-to-end performance are assessed. The voice solution and voice capacity in LTE are also illustrated. Finally, the main differences between LTE TDD and FDD modes are examined and HSPA evolution in 3GPP Releases 7 and 8 is described. \nLTE for UMTS is one of the first books to provide a comprehensive guide to the standards and technologies of LTE. Key features of the book include: \n\nCovers all the key aspects of LTE in a systematic manner \nPresents full description of 3GPP Release 8 LTE \nExamines the expected performance of LTE \nWritten by experts actively involved in the 3GPP standards and product development.\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~REQUESTED BY: zarahustra~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPS: If you have an ORIGINAL (non &quot;for dummies&quot;) E-book request Feel free to post\nit below.
