Over the course of a week, Alex offered up nine candidates to be put through a rigorous interview process, and three have been selected for the final.\n\nThe finalists' challenge is to produce a three-course menu embracing local ingredients for a restaurant full of regular diners. They will also have to manage a brigade of chefs, testing not only their cooking skills but also their ability to run a kitchen. With the promise of a head chef position on offer, the tension in the kitchen is high. With both candidates neck and neck after the starter and main course, it all rests on the dessert. One candidate fails to initially impress with the underwhelming choice of cheesecake, which tastes surprisingly good, whereas the other produces an intricate chocolate feast for the eyes - but it fails to taste of chocolate.\n\nAt the end of the night, Alex and the owners will select one candidate to become their new head chef.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e1619b45c6f64cc07afcc8e610b31a2b5715ca","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E08.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e1619b45c6f64cc07afcc8e610b31a2b5715ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,225,97,155,69,198,246,76,192,122,252,200,230,16,179,26,43,87,21,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
