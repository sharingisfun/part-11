This is the first album to feature the group as a quartet, as rhythm guitarist Joan Jett took over lead vocals in the wake of the departure of Cherie Currie for a solo career and Vicki Blue (aka Victory Tischler-Blue) replaced Jackie Fox on bass. Though it failed to chart in the US, it was successful in Europe. The album entered at number 34 on the Swedish Album Chart, and the lead single 'School Days' peaked at no. 29 in Belgium.\n\n\nThe Runaways were an American all-female rock band that recorded and performed in the second half of the 1970s. The band released four studio albums and one live set during its run. Among their best-known songs are &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Queens of Noise&quot; and a cover version of the Velvet UndergroundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. The Runaways, though never a major success in the United States, became a sensation overseas, e.g. in Japan, thanks to the hit single &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;.\n\nThe Runaways were formed in late 1975 by drummer Sandy West and rhythm guitarist Joan Jett after they had both introduced themselves to producer Kim Fowley, who gave Jett's phone number to West. The two met on their own at West's home and later called Fowley to let him hear the outcome. Fowley then helped the girls find other members. Two decades later he said, &quot;I didn't put the Runaways together, I had an idea, they had ideas, we all met, there was combustion and out of five different versions of that group came the five girls who were the ones that people liked.&quot;\n\nStarting as a power trio with singer/bassist Micki Steele, the Runaways began the party and club circuit around Los Angeles. They soon added lead guitarist Lita Ford who had originally auditioned for the bass spot. Steele was fired from the group, later resurfacing in the Bangles. Local bassist Peggy Foster took over on bass but left after just one month. Lead singer Cherie Currie was found and recruited in a local teen nightclub called the Sugar Shack, followed by Jackie Fox (who had originally auditioned for the lead guitar spot) on bass.\n\nThe Runaways were signed to Mercury Records in 1976 and their debut album, The Runaways, was released shortly after. The band toured the U.S. and played numerous sold-out shows. They headlined shows with opening acts such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The documentary Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways, directed by former Runaway bassist Vicki Blue (aka Victory Tischler-Blue) revealed that each girl patterned herself after her idols: Currie patterned her look after David Bowie, Jett after Suzi Quatro, Ford as a cross between Jeff Beck and Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, West after Queen drummer Roger Taylor, and Fox after Kiss bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons.\n\nDisagreement between band members included the musical style; Joan Jett wanted the band to take a musical change, shifting towards punk rock/glam rock while Lita Ford and Sandy West wanted to continue playing hard rock/heavy metal music. Neither would accept the other's point of view. Finally, the band played their last concert on New Year's Eve 1978 at the Cow Palace near San Francisco and officially broke up in April 1979.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitin%27_for_the_Night&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitin%27_for_the_Night&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ojm3jsy6b/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ojm3jsy6b/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 768x576 25fps 5500kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:02:47\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
