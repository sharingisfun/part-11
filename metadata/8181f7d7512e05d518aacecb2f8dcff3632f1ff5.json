Legends of British musical comedy from the 1960s. \nWonderful weirdness to brighten any day. Featuring Vivian Stanshall (who performed \n&quot;Death Cab For Cutie&quot; with the band in the Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour), as \nwell as Neil Innes (of Monty Python films, The Rutles, Rutland Weekend Television \nand The Innes Book of Records) and Roger Ruskin-Spear and his Kinetic Wardrobe.\n\nRecently remastered (2007) in gorgeous FLAC, here is the entire Bonzo discography, \nplus solo material and rarities from Vivian, Neil and company.\n\nEverything always has to come eventually to some sort of end so I thought it to be \nnice to finish, for the time being, my previous Bonzo Dog Band / Vivian Stanshall / \nNeil Innes uploads with a nice collection in the form of a home-made box-set-like \noverview, comprising nearly every available recording by the Bonzo Dog Band that's \ncurrently available and includes interesting nice-to-have tracks released by \nformer-members.\n\nThis 'Doo-Dah For Now' project consists of 11 CD's of which eight are filled with \nrecordings by the Bonzo Dog Band and three with solo-recordings by former members. \nWithin the directory of each volume is a txt file with liner-notes including \noriginal release info, some artwork, running times and resources for all tracks.\n\nAlthough some compilations in this collection (for instance 'Bonzo Dog Band - The \nBBC Recordings' and 'Vivian Stanshall - Collected Rarities') were uploaded on \nDemonoid before, some tracks were altered where necessary (repaired or otherwise \nadjusted) with the main aim to present the songs in this collection as listenable \nand complete as possible without doing any harm to the integrity of the original \nrecordings. Contents could also be changed, some compilations are expanded, some \nhave tracks deleted due to lack of space or because new information was found. For \nsome songs lossless sources could not be found, these are in the testfiles \nindicated with '*'.\n\nGlobal Overview:\n\nCD-01 Gorilla &amp; The Doughnut In Granny's Greenhouse - 1:16:21\nThe first two albums with the tracks sourced from the 2007 stereo remasters. \nOriginally intended for this collection as two volumes including vinyl rips of the \noriginal mono albums. As these were impossible to find this idea was abandoned.\n\nCD-02 Tadpoles &amp; Keynsham - 1:13:50\nTracks mostly sourced from the 2007 stereo remasters. Both albums were originally \nreleased in stereo only but with some differences between the UK and US releases. \n'The Monster Mash' is a slightly different ending version taken from the original \nUS vinyl release, while 'Ali-Baba's Camel' (missing a few beats of the intro on the \n2007 remaster) has the complete intro restored.\n\n\nCD-03 Outtakes, Rarities &amp; B-sides - 1:21:07\nHome made compilation combining the Parlophone singles in stereo, outtakes from \nrecording sessions, rare song versions, single B-sides and more.\n\nCD-04 Let's Make Up And Be Friendly (&amp; some more Rarities) - 1:17:44\nComprising the final Bonzo Dog Band album 'Let's Make Up And Be Friendly', two \ndifferent-ending versions of 'Rusty (Champion Thrust)', the 1987 reunion single \nreleased in 1992 (including the demo) and some mono releases.\n\nCD-05 Look At Me I'm Wonderful (TV Performances) - 1:22:40\nRevised version with the audio of the recently surfaced Bellevue Amsterdam TV \nperformance added (including a rare rendition of 'Blue Suede Shoes') with 'Death \nCab For Cutie' recording from the Magical Mystery Tour film moved to CD03 and the \nthree bonus tracks moved to CD06.\n\nCD-06 BBC Radio Recordings Volume 1 - 1:17:45\nNew compilation only including the most listenable recordings from BBC radio shows \nlike 'Top Gear' and 'Saturday Club'.\n\nCD-07 BBC Radio Recordings Volume 2 / Jazz Bilzen 1969 - 1:20:09\nNew compilation again omitting the poor quality BBC radio recordings but with the \naudio from the Jazz Bilzen show TV-broadcast in Belgium included.\n\nCD-08 Grunt, Howl! Grunt, Howl! (Live In Holland &amp; USA 1969) - 1:09:34\nThe Paradiso Amsterdam and Fillmore East NYC shows. The first sourced from a Dutch \nradio broadcast and the second from an audience recording.\n\nCD-09 Vivian Stanshall - Collected Rarities Volume 1 - 1:22:31\nCD-10 Vivian Stanshall - Collected Rarities Volume 2 - 1:27:20\nCombines rare solo-singles, collaborations, guest appearances \nand other hard-to-find recordings from his sometimes erratic solo-career. The newly \ncompiled second volume has more rarities, songs from the 'Sir Henry At Rawlinson \nEnd' album and some enjoyable live recordings from one of the last great English \neccentrics. At the end of this volume (as bonus tracks) the songs which he co-wrote \nwith Steve Winwood.\n\nCD-11 The Other Dogs - Collected Rarities - 1:20:52\nMore rarities from the solo ventures of former-Bonzo Dog Band members Neil Innes, \nRoger Ruskin Spear and 'Legs' Larry Smith. This compilation combines hard-to-find \nsongs, singles, collaborations, guest appearances and more.\n\nOriginally uploaded November 8, 2011 by beatleV\n\n1967 Gorilla\nTT: 35:34\n1.
