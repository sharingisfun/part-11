Empowered by the new unique data recovery technologies, it is the most comprehensive data recovery solution for recovery files from FAT12/16/32/exFAT, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux) partitions. It functions on local and network disks, even if such partitions are formatted, damaged or deleted. Flexible parameter settings give you absolute control over data recovery. The R-Studio data recovery software was originally developed for use by data recovery experts, system administrators, IT professionals, and advanced and experienced computer users. Some of R-Studio's features were even designed exclusively for computer forensic experts, and most R-Studio users don't need every single feature of the software.\n\nBecause of the many features presented in R-Studio, there may be inexperienced users who find its interface and abundant functionality a bit confusing. We've actually tried to simplify the software interface as much as possible and have included a detailed Help Manual with the product. However, we recommend to those who still feel uncomfortable with the software after reading the Manual that they start their data recovery experience with the R-Undelete file recovery tool. Its three-step wizard-oriented user interface provides an easier way to perform ordinary data recovery tasks without any compromise to their efficiency. It's the best choice for basic and some advanced data recovery needs. Below you may compare the main features of R-Studio and R-Undelete.\n\n\nR-Studio utilities recover files:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Deleted without Recycle Bin, or when Recycle Bin has been emptied;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Removed by virus attack or power failure;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ After the partition with the files was reformatted, even for different file system;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ When the partition structure on a hard disk was changed or damaged. In this case, R-Studio utilities can scan the Hard disk trying to find previously existed partitions and recover files from found partitions.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ From hard disk with bad sectors. R-Studio Data Recovery Software can first copy the entire disk or its part into an image file and then process such image file. This is especially useful when new bad sectors are constantly appearing on the hard disk, and remaining information must be immediately saved.\n\nR-Studio Data Recovery Features:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Standard Windows Explorer - style interface.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Host OS: Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista, 2008 Server, Windows 7.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Data recovery over the Network. Files can be recovered on network computers running Win95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Windows 7, Macintosh, Linux, and UNIX.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supported file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, NTFS5 (created or updated by Win2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7), HFS/HFS+ (Macintosh), Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris) and Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Recognition and parsing Dynamic (Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7), Basic(MBR) and BSD (UNIX) partitions layout schema and Apple partition map. Dynamic partitions over GPT are supported as well as dynamic partitions over MBR.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Damaged RAID recovery. If the OS cannot recognize your RAID, you can create a virtual RAID from its components. Such virtual RAID can be processed like a real one.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Creates IMAGE FILES for an entire Hard Disk, Partition or its part. Such image files can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/flash or FAT16/FAT32/exFAT. Then the image files can be processed like regular disks.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Data recovery on damaged or deleted partitions, encrypted files (NTFS 5), alternative data streams (NTFS, NTFS 5).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Recovering data if:\n- FDISK or other disk utilities have been run;\n- VIRUS has invaded; FAT is damaged; MBR is destroyed.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Recognizes localized names.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Recovered files can be saved on any (including network) disks accessible by the host operating system.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ File or disk content can be viewed and edited with the advanced hexadecimal editor. The editor supports NTFS file attribute editing.\n\nNew R-Studio features in version 5.x:\n* NAT/firewall traversal. A connection can be established either from R-Studio to R-Studio Agent, or from R-Studio Agent to R-Studio. This allows R-Studio to traverse NAT/firewall when recovering data over the Internet. HTTP tunneling is used when necessary.\n* Scan algorithm improvement. Scanning was improved for FAT and NTFS partitions.\n* In-place saving of recovered files on a remote computer. When recovering data on a remote computer over network, R-Studio can now save recovered files to another disk of the same remote computer-to an external USB hard drive, for example. Moreover, the remote computer can be connected to the Internet rather than to a local network. This feature is especially useful for data recovery technicians and corporations, which can now serve their clients truly remotely over the Internet and do not need to transfer large volumes of data over network. In addition, files recovered from a remote computer can be saved to a local computer or on another remote computer with an Internet connection where R-Studio Agent is running.\n* Forensic mode (Technician version only). In this mode, R-Studio generates a forensic data collection audit log that can be presented at court hearings. This log includes information about a hardware configuration on which the forensic data collection takes place and MD5 checksum for recovered files.\n* RAID 6 support, including Reed-Solomon and Vertical XOR. Support for custom-specified RAID 6 layouts.\n* Support for exFAT and Ext4 FS file systems.\n* Advanced object copy. In addition to byte to byte copy of any object visible in the Drives panel, smart copy of partitions and hard drives with size and offset adjustment is available.\n* Support for 64- and 32-bit Windows versions. Under a 64-bit Windows, R-Studio overcomes the 3GB RAM limit for a 32-bit application and utilizes all physical RAM installed in the 64-bit Windows machine. This greatly enhances performance of the software, especially when scanning high-capacity disks.\n* Progress bar. It shows the progress for an individual file being recovered and overall recovery process, elapsed and remaining time, and recovery log.\n* Clickable links in the text/hexadecimal editor. Those links provide direct jumps to important parts of objects being analyzed and edited.\n\n\n\nInstall notes:\nInstall\nCompany and Name type any, the Registration Key in the file such as serial.txt.\n\nscreen after installation:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bmw-mpower.pl/foto/di-14132076489413.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bmw-mpower.pl/foto/di-14132076489413.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a2360f147900aaa75176ce212d9aff7146abb5","amp;dn":"R-Studio+5.4+Build+134372+Corporate+Edition+32bit+%26amp%3B+64bit+%2B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a2360f147900aaa75176ce212d9aff7146abb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,162,54,15,20,121,0,170,167,81,118,206,33,45,154,255,113,70,171,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
