The Great Escape (4:24)\n\n  A lot has happened to P!nk since the release of her 2008 breakup album, Funhouse, most notably a reconciliation with her estranged husband, Carey Hart, and subsequent birth of their child in 2011. P!nk wrestles with these two life-changing events and many other thorny issues on her 2012 album, The Truth About Love, a vibrant mess of a record that finds the pop star embracing every one of her contradictions. Alone among the class of 2000 -- a group that roughly includes such other new millennium stars as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, and Jessica Simpson -- P!nk comes across as an actual adult, eager to dive into the muck of grown-up emotions, expanding and deepening her music without succumbing to stuffy pretension. She may be deeply invested in being a wife and mother but she's keenly aware of what's happening outside of her house, offering a clever spin on Ke$ha's freak empowerment on the opening &quot;Are We All We Are,&quot; enlisting Fun.'s Nate Ruess as a duet partner on &quot;Just Give Me a Reason,&quot; and fiendishly stealing some of the Black Keys' moves and retailoring them for the dancefloor on &quot;How Come You're Not Here.&quot; P!nk deftly weaves these new threads into a tapestry that contains a few of her signature moves -- there is a handful of confessional power ballads and snotty, funny pure pop disguised as dance hits -- and some surprises, including cameos from Lily Allen (&quot;True Love&quot;) and Eminem (&quot;Here Comes the Weekend&quot;) and a title track that is as sunny and carnivalesque as a '60s surf-pop sensation. Sometimes the transitions are too sudden, causing some aural whiplash -- that clomping, heavy &quot;Here Comes the Weekend&quot; wouldn't fit neatly into any sequence -- but its ragged edges underscore the essential appeal of The Truth About Love: nothing about it is neat, it shifts courses and refutes itself, it's &quot;nasty and salty,&quot; as P!nk herself sings about true love. It's weird and willfully, proudly human, a big pop album about real emotions and one of P!nk's wildest rides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b9762e31db74a95bfb43fe41aeccb173658421","amp;dn":"Pink+-+The+Truth+About+Love+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b9762e31db74a95bfb43fe41aeccb173658421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,185,118,46,49,219,116,169,91,251,67,254,65,174,204,177,115,101,132,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
