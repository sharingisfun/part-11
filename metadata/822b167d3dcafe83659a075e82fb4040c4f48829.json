The film shows how Jamaica's agriculture, industry, government, and culture have been restructured by import-export systems, leaving the local people to struggle in poverty and work in sweat shops. Author Jamaica Kincaid, whose book A SMALL PLACE inspired the film, narrates with Belinda Becker. A reggae soundtrack that includes songs by Bob Marley, Ziggy Marley, Mutubaruka, and Peter Tosh engages viewers and calls them to action while reinforcing messages about the serious political issues that are the focus of the film. LIFE AND DEBT was screened as part of the 2001 Human Rights Watch International Film Festival at Lincoln Center in New York City. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284262/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284262/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: 128 kb/s CBR MP3, Joint Stereo (English)\nSubtitles: None\nVideo: 1000 Kbps Xvid at 23 fps\nResolution: 608 x 352\n\nRunning Time: 1 Hour 26 Minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822b167d3dcafe83659a075e82fb4040c4f48829","amp;dn":"Life+and+Debt+%282001%29+-+Xvid+-+JackTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822b167d3dcafe83659a075e82fb4040c4f48829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,43,22,125,61,202,254,131,101,154,7,94,130,251,64,64,196,244,136,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
