Translated from the Arabic by Catherine Cobham.\n\nISBN: 9780981955711 | 164 pages | PDF\n\n\nMAHMOUD DARWISH (1941-2008) was an world-renowned Palestinian poet and author who won numerous awards for his work and was regarded as the national poet of Palestine.  \n\nA central theme in Darwish's poetry is the concept of watan or homeland.  In his work, Palestine became a metaphor for the loss of Eden, birth and resurrection, and the anguish of dispossession and exile.  Darwish has been described as incarnating and reflecting &quot;the tradition of the political poet in Islam, the man of action whose action is poetry.&quot;\n\nThis remarkable collection of poems, meditations, fragments, and journal entries was DarwishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last volume to come out in Arabic. It is at once lyrical and philosophical, questioning and wise, full of irony, resistance, and play. Darwish's musings on unrest and loss dwell on love and humanity; myth and dream are inseparable from truth. Throughout this personal collection, Darwish returns frequently to his ongoing and often lighthearted conversation with death.\n\nA River Dies of Thirst is a collection of quiet revelations, embracing poetry, life, death, love, and the human condition.\n\nSee also the biography of Darwish at Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_darwish&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_darwish&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Mahmoud Darwish is one of the greatest poets of our time.
