Robert Taylor stars as John Nordley, an opportunistic charter boat captain whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always willing to skirt the rules if the price is right. When NordleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passenger dies on a clandestine voyage from England to Holland, the Dutch police want answers Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as the cryptic map the dead man was carrying. Now, to clear his name, Nordley must team up with the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Constanta (Nicole Maurey), and follow a dangerous trail of clues to a fortune in buried treasure. Actor Robert Taylor appeared in more than 70 films and was under contract with MGM for a record 24 years, from 1934 to 1958. His movie career continued well into the 1960s, during which time he also starred on television in the series The Detective and Death Valley Days.\n \nDecember 17, 1959\nMystery From Britain\n\nA. H. WEILER.\nALTHOUGH producer David Rose and his skilled company obviously were not being imitative, they have flatteringly followed the format of the successful British mystery makers in fashioning &quot;The House of Seven Hawks,&quot; which landed yesterday at neighborhood theatres around town. For this suspense yarn filmed in England and in the Netherlands for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is a neat package of economical dialogue, a satisfyingly labyrinthine plot and carefully paced direction and underplaying that adds up to a modest but truly taut and absorbing diversion.\n\nPerhaps Jo Eisinger's script does not explain why Robert Taylor, an American, happens to be the skipper of a charter boat in England taking a clandestine trip to the continent with a clandestine passenger. But enough interesting red herrings follow this voyage to the Netherlands to please the more demanding of the whodunit fans. He finds his passenger dead before arrival. He is a man who had been carrying a cryptic map and a dispatch case full of currency, and, it evolves eventually, had a record as a Dutch detective searching for a million-dollar cache of loot taken as far back as the Nazi invasion.\n\nAs a hapless fugitive who is a prime suspect of The Hague's police and a gent sought by the dastards anxious to lay covetous hands on this king-sized boodle, Mr. Taylor naturally is involved with sinister citizens, a couple of mysterious but highly decorative dames and, of course, the police. To the credit of Richard Thorpe, the director, and his crew, the mystery, search and chase are given added color by advantageous use of the natural locales of The Hague.\n\nExcept for the climactic set-to, which is a standard shoot-'em-up affair, Mr. Thorpe and his troupe are oblique but adroit in their approach to their story. Although he is a somewhat lean, gaunt and subdued hero, Mr. Taylor looks and acts the part of a beleaguered but tough citizen who can figure and fight his way out of a bizarre mess.\n\nThe British add their professional acting aid to Mr. Taylor and the film's cause. Count among them Donald Wolfit, as a wily Dutch police chief; Eric Pohlmann and David Kossoff, as, respectively, a threatening and a timid villain, and Philo Hauser, as a humorous two-timer who loves to be involved in double dealing &quot;because,&quot; as he says, grinning, &quot;it's my nature.&quot; As the ladies of this whodunit. Linda Christian, who plays a conniver, and Nicole Maurey, as Mr. Taylor's romantic vis-ÃƒÂ -vis, are, as noted, decorative.\n\nIt is still a mystery why the title was changed from &quot;The House of Seven Flies&quot; to &quot;The House of Seven Hawks,&quot; but it is eminently clear that this is an unpretentious but satisfying entertainment.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.18gb\nDuration.... 01:31:48\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 400\nData Rate.... 1744kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 103kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8246ba80418a4fb6b956ace6d1cd49275ec76f1c","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Seven+Hawks+1959+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8246ba80418a4fb6b956ace6d1cd49275ec76f1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,70,186,128,65,138,79,182,185,86,172,230,209,205,73,39,94,199,111,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
