We'll start by learning how to animate with constraints. We'll then learn about path animation, and to conclude the training, we'll delve deeper into the Graph Editor, learning more about the amazing tools it offers to help us bring our work to the next level. \n\nThese tutorials are designed to be taken in sequence so we really encourage you to start with Volume 1 before continuing with this section. We also encourage you to take advantage of the assignments that follow each Volume. These assignments will allow you to take what you've learned and apply those tools and techniques to your own projects. \n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and project overview\n\n2.Intuitively scrubbing in MODO with the Time tool\n\n3.Animating with constraints in MODO\n\n4.The Channel Haul\n\n5.Animating a jump\n\n6.Polishing the jump and working with Shadow function\n\n7.Finalizing the animation\n\n8.Volume 2 assignment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824addf4740cf4d0ff1250153a188a1d867c206c","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Quick+Start+to+Animation+in+MODO+%28Vol.2%29-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824addf4740cf4d0ff1250153a188a1d867c206c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,74,221,244,116,12,244,208,255,18,80,21,58,24,138,29,134,124,32,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
