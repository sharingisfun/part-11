Using loop pedals, octavers, &amp; double neck guitars Kristian Dunn creates brilliant melodic music himself with only Tim Fogarty accompanying him on drums.\n\n&quot;It's Still Like a Secret&quot; is fittingly entitled as this band has yet to truly blow up. But after you download this, promise you'll go see them live. You will NOT regret that decision.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82680d8f76c0d92102b5d3acfa1cde327690f2ae","amp;dn":"el+ten+eleven+-+it%5C%27s+still+like+a+secret+%282010%29+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82680d8f76c0d92102b5d3acfa1cde327690f2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,104,13,143,118,192,217,33,2,181,211,172,250,28,222,50,118,144,242,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
