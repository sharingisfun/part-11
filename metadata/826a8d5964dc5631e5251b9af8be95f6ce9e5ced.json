This is the BRIEF edition!\nTITLE: Connect Core Concepts in Health 12th Edition BRIEF\nAuthors: Paul M. Insel, Walton T. Roth\nISBN-10: 0073404675\nISBN-13: 978-0073404677\nPAGES: Actual book contains about 480 pages; this pdf contains 806 pages. SEE BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE PAGE NUMBERING OF THIS PDF\nI printed this book by printing (via saving as pdf) the individual sections of this book while I was on trial for the access code. The trial included the e-book which is how I was able to save the sections as a pdf in the first place. The pictures are included in this e-book and so are the various tables (which look different). The e-book printing options only enabled for a printer-friendly version, so the pages will not look identical to the actual book's pages. Anyways, the page numbering is off for this reason. Since this pdf is searchable, you can type in &quot;page [insert number here]&quot; if you need to find a specific page (ex. Page 144). There is also no index as the website's e-book did not enable the option to do so; however, the index isn't really necessary since this file is text searchable anyways!\n\nBecause the pages were printed in a printer-friendly format, this pdf is not going to be as aesthetically pleasing as the actual book. With all of this being said, if you do not like the format of this FREE pdf, please feel free to purchase this book from Amazon, your local college textbook store, or even the book's actual website. Otherwise, please enjoy! And do seed please when you are are finished downloading.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826a8d5964dc5631e5251b9af8be95f6ce9e5ced","amp;dn":"Connect+Core+Concepts+in+Health+Twelfth+Edition+Brief.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826a8d5964dc5631e5251b9af8be95f6ce9e5ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,106,141,89,100,220,86,49,229,37,27,154,248,190,149,246,206,158,92,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
