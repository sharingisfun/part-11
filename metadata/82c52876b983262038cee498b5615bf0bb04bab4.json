It's a broad church too, from the humble 924 to the mighty Carrera GT, and in between there's the iconic 911 in all its forms, a car that will soon be celebrating 50 years of production and the inspiration behind our title. Add to that the new breed of Boxsters, Caymans, Cayennes and Panameras, plus the classics and the race cars too, and 911 &amp; Porsche World has got it covered.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c52876b983262038cee498b5615bf0bb04bab4","amp;dn":"911+%26amp%3B+Porsche+World+-+January+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c52876b983262038cee498b5615bf0bb04bab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,197,40,118,185,131,38,32,56,206,228,152,181,97,91,240,187,4,186,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
