The multiverse proposal helps to explain the origin of the universe and some of its observational features. Since the physical constants can be different in other universes, the fine-tunings which appear necessary for the emergence of life may also be explained. Nevertheless, many physicists remain uncomfortable with the multiverse proposal, since it is highly speculative and perhaps untestable. In this volume, a number of active and eminent researchers in the field - mainly cosmologists and particle physicists but also some philosophers - address these issues and describe recent developments. The articles represent the full spectrum of views, providing for the first time an overview of the subject. They are written at different academic levels, engaging lay-readers and researchers alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82da95e044e8d448f920347441ee827c34079054","amp;dn":"+Universe+or+Multiverse+-+Bernard+Carr+%28Editor%29+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+PD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82da95e044e8d448f920347441ee827c34079054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,218,149,224,68,232,212,72,249,32,52,116,65,238,130,124,52,7,144,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
