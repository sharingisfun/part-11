The Fragments API (introduced in Android 3.0) helps you deal with this issue. This course teaches Android developers how to program with the Fragments API, and build apps that work well on a wide variety of devices. David Gassner shows how to define different fragment layouts and add them to activities with XML or Java, create layouts for different screens and use a resource alias to select the right layout at runtime, and communicate between activities and fragments. He'll also show you how to make fragments work on older versions of Android, with the support library, and use fragments to display dialogs and preference screens.\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding fragments\nAdding fragments to activities\nCreating layouts for multiple screens\nUnderstanding arguments and callback methods\nUpdating apps with support for fragments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82ea076443253c8d24d6cfbbae796404a1e3ed4d","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+Building+Adaptive+Android+Apps+with+Fragments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82ea076443253c8d24d6cfbbae796404a1e3ed4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,234,7,100,67,37,60,141,36,214,207,187,174,121,100,4,161,227,237,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
