The movie describes a fictional attack on the United States by its own government, working in concert with a global terrorist organization and the United Nations. Heavin has said that he regards the events in the film as a &quot;very real threat&quot;, and has described it as a movie that the government does not want people to see.\r\n\r\nThe movie was shot on Heavinâ€™s Central Texas ranch and in nearby towns, and the majority of the film's cast were recruited locally, Norris stating that &quot;there were a number of agencies that would not allow their clients to be a part of the film&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe movie was released on 13 May 2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:831385605922bd3da11c801d746e40f2c61afb55","amp;dn":"Amerigeddon+720p+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"831385605922bd3da11c801d746e40f2c61afb55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,19,133,96,89,34,189,61,161,28,128,29,116,110,64,242,198,26,251,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
