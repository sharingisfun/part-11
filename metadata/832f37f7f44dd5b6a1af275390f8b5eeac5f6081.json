Formed by college friends vocalist/keyboardist Cy Curnin and drummer Adam Woods in the early '80s, the pair advertised in the music press for additional members; the remaining members of the group -- guitarist Jamie West-Oram, keyboardist Rupert Greenall, and bassist Charlie Barret -- all responded to the ad. Taking the name the Portraits, the band recorded a single for Ariola Records, &quot;Hazards in the Home,&quot; which failed to gather much attention. Within a year, the band had changed its name to the Fixx and recorded &quot;Lost Planes,&quot; the single that led to a record contract with MCA.  \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal/Hip-O\nCatalog:\t\t088 112 117 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Stand Or Fall\n02.Red Skies\n03.Lost Planes\n04.Some People\n05.Saved By Zero\n06.One Thing Leads To Another\n07.The Sign Of Fire\n08.Going Overboard\n09.Deeper And Deeper (Long Version)\n10.Are We Ourselves?\n11.Sunshine In The Shade\n12.Less Cities, More Moving People\n13.A Letter To Both Sides\n14.Secret Separation\n15.Built For The Future\n16.Driven Out\n17.How Much Is Enough\n18.No One Has To Cry\n19.Two Different Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832f37f7f44dd5b6a1af275390f8b5eeac5f6081","amp;dn":"The+Fixx+-+Ultimate+Collection+%281999%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832f37f7f44dd5b6a1af275390f8b5eeac5f6081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,47,55,247,244,77,213,182,161,175,39,83,144,248,181,238,172,95,96,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
