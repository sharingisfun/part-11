Instead, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until early 2008 that the folks at Universal saw a YouTube clip of the monks at one of the PopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite monasteries, and set about making Chant. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most authentic recording youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever hear of Gregorian Chant Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the prayer that has been sung in free rhythm by Christian monks for more than a thousand years. It is, quite literally, Music for the Soul.&quot; - iTunes\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a now well-known story: earlier this year Universal UK placed ads in various religious publications encouraging monks and sacred singers to submit demos for consideration of a major recording contract. Word reached the monks of the Cistercian Abbey Stift Heiligenkreuz in Vienna, who applied via a clip they had posted on YouTube. With their rich and evocative sound The Monks were the easy favorites. It helped that Pope Benedict XVI has declared this to be one of his favorite monasteries. Suddenly these very modern Monks were poised to become an overnight sensation, seized on by widespread international media. \n\nThe monastery, located in the idyllic Vienna woods, was founded in 875 and is the longest, continuously operating Cistercian Abbey in the world. The music on this album is the music of their daily lives, sung without alteration. Full of contemplation and inner quiet, the music provides instant relaxation and stress relief.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1. Antiphon &quot;In Paradisum&quot; et Psalmus 121 (122)\n2.
