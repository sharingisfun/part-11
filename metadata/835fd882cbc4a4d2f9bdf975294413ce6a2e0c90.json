Roswell\n\n Ã‚Â Keel Her is the project of Brighton, England's lo-fi singer/songwriter Rose Keeler-SchÃƒÂ¤ffeler, who began writing and recording her songs in her bedroom. Evoking classic and contemporary indie pop as well as riot grrrl's energy, Keel Her's songs appeared on Soundcloud at a rapid rate -- sometimes daily. The project's lineup included guitarist James Levitt and drummer Andrew Barnes for live dates. After signing to Critical Heights, Keel Her issued the singles Prize Catch, Riot Grrrl, and Don't Look at Me ahead of a self-titled debut album, which featured collaborations with R. Stevie Moore and Hot Sugar. Keel Herarrived in February 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835fd882cbc4a4d2f9bdf975294413ce6a2e0c90","amp;dn":"Keel+Her+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835fd882cbc4a4d2f9bdf975294413ce6a2e0c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,95,216,130,203,196,164,210,249,189,249,117,41,68,19,206,106,46,12,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
