The government has secretly continued Dr. Kirk's research into Third Energy. Once again a rift in time has opened, and everything related to the project is lost in time. Now, Regina and her special forces team must use a different time device and travel to the era where they believe the facility is now located. When the team arrives, it is quickly decimated by a dinosaur attack. It's up to Regina and Dylan, the only two survivors, to find out what happened. In order to defeat the dinos and return home safely, you'll have to learn to use each character's special talents.\n\nOne thing you'll have no matter which character you are is sharp shooting skills, which come in handy when you've got 10 different species of dinosaurs on your tail! If you score quick kills, you will earn you big points that can be used to obtain additional weapons, ammunition, and other supplies.
