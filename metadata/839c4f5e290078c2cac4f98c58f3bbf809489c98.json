Into this world comes seventeen-year-old Victoria Darling, who wants only to be an artistÃ¢â‚¬â€a nearly impossible dream for a girl.\n\nAfter Vicky poses nude for her illicit art class, she is expelled from her French finishing school. Shamed and scandalized, her parents try to marry her off to the wealthy Edmund Carrick-Humphrey. But Vicky has other things on her mind: her clandestine application to the Royal College of Art; her participation in the suffragette movement; and her growing attraction to a working-class boy who may be her museÃ¢â‚¬â€or may be the love of her life. As the world of debutante balls, corsets, and high society obligations closes in around her, Vicky must figure out: just how much is she willing to sacrifice to pursue her dreams?\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Listening Library (Audio); Unabridged edition (January 28, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0804167540\nISBN-13: 978-0804167543\n\n[b] Katharine McEwan (Reader)[/b]\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
