John Heil discusses such issues as whether the world includes levels of reality; the nature of objects and properties; the demands of realism; what makes things true; qualities, powers, and the relation these bear to one another. He advances an account of the fundamental constituents of the world around us, and applies this account to problems that have plagued recent work in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics (color, intentionality, and the nature of consciousness).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a55846d1858724cae5714d9448398b16e45a78","amp;dn":"From+an+Ontological+Point+of+View","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a55846d1858724cae5714d9448398b16e45a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,165,88,70,209,133,135,36,202,229,113,77,148,72,57,139,22,228,90,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
