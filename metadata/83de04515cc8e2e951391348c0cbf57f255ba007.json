He eventually moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, and subsequently signed a solo recording deal with Mushroom Records. His album releases would simply use the name Doucette, rather than under a full name.\n\nMama Let Him Play, the first Doucette release, earned platinum status (sales of 100 000 units in Canada) and substantial publicity and tour promotion. The following year's release The Douce is Loose was less successful, although it earned gold status (50 000 units sold) and produced the popular single &quot;Nobody&quot; co-written with drummer Duris Maxwell.\n\nMushroom Records eventually succumbed to financial problems, leaving Doucette to find a new label for his third album, Coming up Roses. This, plus the emergence of New Wave music, were blamed for Doucette's lack of follow-up success in the music industry.\n\nJerry Doucette currently resides in Tsawwassen, British Columbia.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83de04515cc8e2e951391348c0cbf57f255ba007","amp;dn":"Doucette+-+Mama+Let+Him+Play+%5B1977%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83de04515cc8e2e951391348c0cbf57f255ba007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,222,4,81,92,200,226,233,81,57,19,72,192,203,245,127,37,91,160,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
