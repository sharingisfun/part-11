It was released on September 9, 1999.\n\nMake way for the first great brother band of the 21st century. A, an economically titled Brit band featuring siblings Jason, Adam, and Giles Perry, combine the harmonic splendor of the Beach Boys with the sonic onslaught of the Buzzcocks. The band doesn&amp;#039;t hide its influences, Jason&amp;#039;s upper-register vocals evoke a more tuneful Perry Farrell on &quot;Jason&amp;#039;s Addiction&quot;. There are even moments where A sounds like a punk rock Yes (they covered &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; on an early B-side). Yet they get away with all this and more, thanks to deft craftsmanship, killer chops, and striking arrangements. Moogs, muted trumpets, and the learning toy Speak &amp; Spells sneak into the traditional rock mix, and virtually every track comes with an intoxicating anthemic chorus. And with lyrics like, &quot;Yeah, the trees are pretty wide / That&amp;#039;s where Sonny Bono died / All is quiet on New Year&amp;#039;s Day,&quot; what&amp;#039;s not to love? \n\nBlending the best of Brit-pop with the bite of punk and a touch of techno, this outfit offers a visceral burst of energy. The mix of catchy hooks and snotty insolence put this disc over the top. Dig the bounce of &quot;Old Folks&quot; or the frontal attack of &quot;For Starters&quot; and you&amp;#039;ll get a good idea of where they&amp;#039;re coming from. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c428082c23453da94e62b3f635878c2304bb3b","amp;dn":"A+-+A+vs.+Monkey+Kong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c428082c23453da94e62b3f635878c2304bb3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,196,40,8,44,35,69,61,169,78,98,179,246,53,135,140,35,4,187,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
