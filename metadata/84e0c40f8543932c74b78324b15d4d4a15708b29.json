One of the greatest labels for funky Gospel releases was undoubtedly Jewel Records from Shreveport, Louisiana in 1963. From such humble beginnings sprang a recording empire which also included the Paula, Ronn and Soul Power labels. We invited serious DJ's, record collectors and all round funky Gospel addicts, the UK based David Hill and US based Greg Belson, to compile the best funky Gospel and Spiritual Soul from the Jewel archives. Also, we're delighted to include one of the rare records which made it into John Peel's legendary 7'' record box: the sensational ''No More Ghettos In America'' by Stanley Winston, proof positive that Jewel's funky Gospel sound found supporters right across the spectrum.\n\nOne of the funkiest gospel collections you'll ever hope to own Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and an amazing document of the criss-crossing styles going down at the legendary Jewel Records! Jewel didn't just record gospel, but handled a fair bit of soul, funk, blues, and jazz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of which seems to bubble forth in these amazing recordings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tracks that easily represent some of the hippest, coolest gospel sides of the late 60s and early 70s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the kind of work we've dug for years in its ability to easily cross over to the secular scene, thanks to wicked grooves underneath the vocals! And the vocals are pretty darn great too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ work by singers who could have been huge in the mainstream world, had they broken from the spiritual realm Ã¢â‚¬â€œ really belting out with the best of the southern soul scene of the time. The package features a whopping 41 tracks in all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with tracks that &quot;Don't Forget The Bridge&quot; by Mighty Songs Of Glory, &quot;There's A Creator&quot; by Roscoe Robinson, &quot;Trouble's Brewin&quot; by The Meditation Singers, &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; by BP's Revolution, &quot;I'm Trying To Be Your Friend&quot; by Soul Stirrers, &quot;Far Away From God&quot; by Armstrong Brothers, &quot;Golden Gate&quot; by Traveling Echoes, &quot;He's A Friend&quot; by Dorothy Norwood, &quot;Watch That Rogue&quot; by Silver Gate Quartet, &quot;You've Got To Serve Somebody&quot; by Bill Moss, and &quot;The Upper Way&quot; by The Violinaires.\n\nDisc 1/01 The Meditation Singers Trouble's Brewin'.mp3\t9.16 MB\nDisc 1/02 BPS Revolution Brotherly Love.mp3\t5.95 MB\nDisc 1/03 Soul Stirrers I'm Trying to be Your Friend.mp3\t5.67 MB\nDisc 1/04 Ernest Franklin Trying Times.mp3\t3.36 MB\nDisc 1/05 The Hopson Family Prayer Will Take You There.mp3\t4.49 MB\nDisc 1/06 Chimes Woke Up This Morning.mp3\t3.59 MB\nDisc 1/07 Albertina Walker Mama Said, Thank You.mp3\t4.80 MB\nDisc 1/08 The Brooklyn Allstars If Loving God Is Wrong.mp3\t4.88 MB\nDisc 1/09 Keith Barrow Everything's Gonna Be Alright.mp3\t5.73 MB\nDisc 1/10 Dorothy Norwood He's A Friend.mp3\t5.92 MB\nDisc 1/11 The Brooklyn Allstars I'm Glad You're Mine.mp3\t5.59 MB\nDisc 1/12 Leomia Boyd and the Gospel Music Makers Need More Love.mp3\t7.80 MB\nDisc 1/13 The Southerners Jesus Is Real To Me.mp3\t3.46 MB\nDisc 1/14 The Traveling Echoes The Golden Gate.mp3\t4.91 MB\nDisc 1/15 The Violinaires The Upper Way.mp3\t3.77 MB\nDisc 1/16 Roscoe Robinson Do It Right Now.mp3\t3.87 MB\nDisc 1/17 Clarence Fountain This Little Light Of Mine.mp3\t4.82 MB\nDisc 1/18 Soul Stirrers Crying On The Mountain.mp3\t5.23 MB\nDisc 1/19 Armstrong Brothers Far Away For God.mp3\t3.46 MB\nDisc 1/20 The Meditation Singers A Change Is Gonna Come.mp3\t4.48 MB\nDisc 2/01 Armstrong Brothers Can You Treat Him Like a Brother.mp3\t3.50 MB\nDisc 2/02 Bill Moss &amp; The Celestials You've Got to Serve Somebody.mp3\t9.22 MB\nDisc 2/03 The Southerners I'll Wait For The Lord.mp3\t2.68 MB\nDisc 2/04 The Meditation Singers Good Old Gospel Music.mp3\t8.32 MB\nDisc 2/05 Roscoe Robinson There's A Creator.mp3\t5.54 MB\nDisc 2/06 Mighty Sons of Glory Don't Forget The Bridge.mp3\t6.85 MB\nDisc 2/07 Dorothy Norwood There's Got To Be Rain In Your Life.mp3\t5.48 MB\nDisc 2/08 Soul Stirrers Lord, Oh Lord, I Believe.mp3\t5.27 MB\nDisc 2/09 The Meditation Singers I Love My Jesus.mp3\t3.90 MB\nDisc 2/10 The Silver Gate Quartet of North Carolina Watch That Rogue.mp3\t4.82 MB\nDisc 2/11 The Fantastic Violinaires I'm Not Worried.mp3\t3.71 MB\nDisc 2/12 The Hopson Family Hello Sunshine.mp3\t5.10 MB\nDisc 2/13 Dorothy Norwood Come And Go With Me.mp3\t5.36 MB\nDisc 2/14 The Traveling Echoes I'd Like To Know.mp3\t5.38 MB\nDisc 2/15 The Spiritual Interns He Walks With Me.mp3\t2.29 MB\nDisc 2/16 The Brooklyn Allstars In The Ghetto.mp3\t3.43 MB\nDisc 2/17 The Violinaires Message To My Friends.mp3\t13.47 MB\nDisc 2/18 Dorothy Norwood Winding Up.mp3\t4.04 MB\nDisc 2/19 Rev.
