He collaborated with Sydney band Gelbison, touring with the band and co-writing some of the tracks which appear on his debut album Good Morning. This led to the side project Nations by the river, which combined Gelbison with Luke Steele from Sleepy Jackson.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single &quot;Sunshine&quot; (could have been a Beatles song) became the station's most played song in the summer of '06 and was used as a theme for Channel 7's Sunrise.
