Maxwell uses the accurate finite element method to solve static, frequency-domain and time-varying electromagnetic and electric fields. A key benefit of Maxwell is its automated solution process where users are only required to specify geometry, material properties and the desired output. From this point, Maxwell will automatically generate an appropriate, efficient and accurate mesh for solving the problem. This proven automatic adaptive meshing process removes complexity from the analysis process and allows engineers to benefit from a highly-efficient, easy-to-use design flow.\n\nA key feature in Maxwell is the ability to generate high-fidelity, reduced order models from the finite-element solution for use in SimplorerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, ANSYS' multi-domain system simulation software. This capability creates a powerful electromagnetic-based design flow that enables users to combine complex circuits with accurate component models from Maxwell to design complete high-performance electromechanical, mechatronic and power electronic systems.\n\nNew in Maxwell 14.0\n\nANSYS Workbench integration\nGeometry Sharing - Maxwell and ANSYS products are able to share geometry, geometry parameters and material properties\nMultiphysics Coupling\nElectromagnetic - Thermal\nElectromagnetic - Structural\nElectromagnetic-Thermal- Structural\nDesign optimization with ANSYS DesignXplorer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8524480f63c7d12072899cee8f2d7611e0c7f98e","amp;dn":"Ansoft+Maxwell+3D+v.14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8524480f63c7d12072899cee8f2d7611e0c7f98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,36,72,15,99,199,209,32,114,137,156,238,143,45,118,17,224,199,249,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
