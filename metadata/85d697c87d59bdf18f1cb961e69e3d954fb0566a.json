A synopsis is provided of ethics through the ages and the role of ethics in the evolution of medicine. Principles and sources of medical ethics, as well as different religious and secular perspectives, are explained. Ethical concerns in relation to a variety of specific issues are then examined. These issues include, for example, human experimentation, stem cell research, assisted reproductive technologies, termination of pregnancy, rationing of health care, euthanasia, and quality of life issues. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many years of practicing medicine in different cultures and countries and his passion for theology works, philosophy, literature, poetry, history, and anthropology have informed and enriched the contents of this stimulating book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d697c87d59bdf18f1cb961e69e3d954fb0566a","amp;dn":"Ethics+in+Medicine+%28Springer%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d697c87d59bdf18f1cb961e69e3d954fb0566a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,214,151,200,125,89,189,241,143,28,185,97,230,158,61,149,79,176,86,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
