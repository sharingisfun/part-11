This is only discovered in later episodes as his parents' health deteriorates and through an exchange with a colleague who presumed that Kavanagh was actually a Yorkshireman. The series dealt with his battles in the courtroom as well as his domestic dramas which includes the death of his devoted and affectionate wife. \n\nIn court Kavanagh is usually seen to be defending a client who seems likely to be convicted until a twist in the case occurs, but occasionally Kavanagh is seen in a prosecuting role. \n\nPlease seed and if you have Kavanagh QC season 5, please upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d8ae37085e18e9c7d5009bc5e8d56665564ca6","amp;dn":"Kavanagh+QC+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d8ae37085e18e9c7d5009bc5e8d56665564ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,216,174,55,8,94,24,233,199,213,0,155,197,232,213,102,101,86,76,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
