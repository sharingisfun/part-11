Each interval lasts 20 seconds and is followed by 10 seconds of rest. Though any exercise movement can be used in Tabata interval training, a Tabata is only considered a â€œTrue Tabataâ€ if the exercise is performed at an absolute maximum intensity for the entirety of the 8 intervals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85de1d02aea96714ce078bda434c3bd3fc834136","amp;dn":"Tabata+Songs+-+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85de1d02aea96714ce078bda434c3bd3fc834136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,222,29,2,174,169,103,20,206,7,139,218,67,76,59,211,252,131,65,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
