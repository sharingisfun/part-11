This album from Tom Cochrane is another Canadian melodic rock gem. The fantastic hit Life is a Highway is a catchy, upbeat &quot;driving song&quot; that still sounds great to this day. Sinking like a Sunset opens you immediately think Bruce Hornsby. Strong, enjoyable album from beginning to end.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 15\nArtist: Tom Cochrane\nAlbum: Mad Mad World\nYear: 1991\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f48404adaf909a1d3a489217806e3d74a98e6f","amp;dn":"Tom+Cochrane+-+Mad+Mad+World+%5BFLAC-1991%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f48404adaf909a1d3a489217806e3d74a98e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,244,132,4,173,175,144,154,29,58,72,146,23,128,110,61,116,169,142,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
