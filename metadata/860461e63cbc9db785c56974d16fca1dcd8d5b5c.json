It hit the Top Ten and helped English Settlement reach #5 on the album charts, but it would also be their last Top 40 entry for a decade.\n\nThe last major hit of XTC's touring phase was &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot;. This was the first single from their double album English Settlement (February 1982) and their first top 10 hit in the UK.\n\nThe video for &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot; shows the band performing the song in an empty (minus the band and their instruments, amps, etc.) yet colorful room. The video was released on the Look Look video compilation.\n\nIn early 1982, while at the peak of their popularity, XTC embarked on a major tour. This was abruptly cut short when Partridge suffered a mental breakdown on stage during one of the first concerts of the tour in Paris on 18 March 1982.\n\nOn 2 April 1982, a Friday night, XTC were scheduled to play at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, but did not appear. The audience milled about the open festival floor for a long 45 minutes/hour after opening act Oingo Boingo departed the stage, and then finally it was announced that XTC would not take the stage due to the &quot;illness&quot; of one of the band members (later revealed as Andy Partridge's ongoing fight with stage fright in Chris Twomey's book XTC: Chalkhills and Children). XTC never played another tour date. (XTC would perform several acoustic sets for radio only in 1989.)\n\n\nXTC were a new wave rock band from Swindon, England, led by songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding and active between 1976 and 2005. The band enjoyed some chart success, including the UK and Canadian hits &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) and &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot; (1982).\n\nDespite their three-decade career, XTC were a performing and touring band for only six of those years: they retired from live performance in 1982. For the remaining twenty-three years of their existence XTC were a studio-based project involving session players around a nucleus of Partridge, Moulding and Dave Gregory. The band are perhaps better known for long-standing critical acclaim rather than commercial success.\n(video has a semi-transparent yellow/white &quot;vh1 classic rock&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senses_Working_Overtime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senses_Working_Overtime&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaPDnAAfa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaPDnAAfa&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps    \n   Duration: 00:04:34\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
