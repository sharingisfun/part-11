Decked in a black leather jacket, sequinned top and black and red leggings; armed with a red electric guitar and flanked by a bassist, guitarist and a drummer, the rock chick opened the show with her song &quot;What It's Gonna Be&quot;.\n\nOrianthi barely took a breather as she performed hit after hit, which includes &quot;Suffocated&quot;, &quot;Drive Away&quot;, &quot;Think Like A Man&quot;, &quot;Find It&quot;, &quot;Bad News&quot;, &quot;He's Gone&quot;, &quot;Song For Steve&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot; and her famous rock anthems, &quot;According To You&quot; and &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot;. After rocking to several uptempo songs, Orianthi slowed it down a notch as she shared an intimate moment with the audience with her ballad &quot;Courage&quot;.\n\nThroughout the night, Orianthi demonstrated her awesome shredding skills which made her the superstar guitarist she is today. She proved a point during a three-minute guitar solo during her finale song &quot;Voodoo&quot; as the crowd went crazy.\n\nBUT Sorry for the Sound Quality\n\nEnjoy it\n\nSeed !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862ccdb6af6cbb5d48388a903858e3b983aea85b","amp;dn":"Orianthi+Panagaris+Video+Live+In+Kuala+Lumpur+4-8-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862ccdb6af6cbb5d48388a903858e3b983aea85b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,44,205,182,175,108,187,93,72,56,138,144,56,88,227,185,131,174,168,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
