Widowed at 19 and, after losing her child from the marriage, she faces the war grieving and lonely. Then one night during the Blitz, an infant mysteriously abandoned during the bombing is handed into her care...\n\nRuby, meanwhile, doesn't want to be left behind in the wedding stakes and settles for marriage with Frank.\n\nFinally there's Janet, kind-hearted and susceptible to male charm, who is hurt desperately by an affair with a married man.\n\nDavid, the child who steals Edie's heart as she brings him up through a time none of them will ever forget, is the love of all their lives. And when David is old enough to wonder who he really is, he leads Edie through struggle and heartache to a life and love she would never have dreamed of...\n\nRead by Frances Barber\n\n189 min approx.\n\nMP3 - 96 kbps - CBR\n\nSecure rips","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86590cb3171a51ef9977f9926733f63c1f94a57d","amp;dn":"Annie+Murray+-+Chocolate+Girls+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86590cb3171a51ef9977f9926733f63c1f94a57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,89,12,179,23,26,81,239,153,119,249,146,103,51,246,60,31,148,165,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
