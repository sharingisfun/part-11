In 2011, Antoine (Kevin Parent) has a life most people would envy -- he's a successful club DJ living in Montreal with an international following, he has a beautiful girlfriend Rose (Evelyne Brochu), and is raising two healthy daughters. However, Rose is not Antoine's first love, and he's still infatuated with his ex-wife Carole (Helene Florent), the mother  of his children. Carole hopes he'll someday return to her, though despite his feelings there's little evidence to suggest he will. In 1969, Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis) is a single mother who is raising a seven-year-old son Laurent (Marin Gerrier). Laurent was born with Down's Syndrome, and is not expected to live past 25; Jacqueline is determined to do whatever she can for her boy during the time he has, but as the stress of these demands take their toll, we learn that she and Carole share a special connection. Named for a song beloved by both Antoine and Laurent, Cafe de Flore was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, RoviÃ‚Â´\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Cafe de Flore.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 1.39 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 0mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 646 Kbps\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC \n      Nominal bit rate : 1 487 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AAC\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1550312/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1550312/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, French and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by JeanPhilippe, whom we thank\n\nJean-Marc Vallee - Cafe de Flore (2011)\n      ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86cc7ccbbe4073ffa646733b0bda21e40d9364bf","amp;dn":"Jean-Marc+Vallee+-+Cafe+de+Flore+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86cc7ccbbe4073ffa646733b0bda21e40d9364bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,204,124,203,190,64,115,255,166,70,115,59,11,218,33,228,13,147,100,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
