In the corporate enterprise,\nwireless LANs are usually implemented\nas the final link between the existing wired\nnetwork and a group of client computers, giving\nthese users wireless access to the full\nresources and services of the corporate network\nacross a building or campus setting.\nWLANs are on the verge of becoming a\nmainstream connectivity solution for a broad\nrange of business customers. The wireless market\nis expanding rapidly as businesses discover\nthe productivity benefits of going wire-free.\nAccording to Frost and Sullivan, the wireless\nLAN industry exceeded $300 million in 1998\nand will grow to $1.6 billion in 2005. To date,\nwireless LANs have been primarily implemented\nin vertical applications such as manufacturing\nfacilities, warehouses, and retail\nstores. The majority of future wireless LAN\ngrowth is expected in healthcare facilities, educational\ninstitutions, and corporate enterprise\noffice spaces. In the corporation, conference\nrooms, public areas, and branch offices are\nlikely venues for WLANs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e565736a70dec1fe260bbc3f2eaa06f8365b62","amp;dn":"IEEE+802.11b+Wireless+Lan+White+Paper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e565736a70dec1fe260bbc3f2eaa06f8365b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,229,101,115,106,112,222,193,254,38,11,188,63,46,170,6,248,54,91,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
