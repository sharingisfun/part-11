Extreme slow-motion shows how a Jesus Christ lizard runs on water, and how a chameleon fires an extendible tongue at its prey with unfailing accuracy. The camera dives on a Niuean sea snake, which avoids predators by swimming to an air bubble at the end of an underwater tunnel, and in a TV first, komodo dragons hunt a huge water-buffalo, stripping its carcass to bone in four hours.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 1.80GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ea41c60e456e68da28112daf863e1ba7d65ad6","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+02of10+Reptiles+and+Amphibians+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ea41c60e456e68da28112daf863e1ba7d65ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,234,65,198,14,69,110,104,218,40,17,45,175,134,62,27,167,214,90,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
