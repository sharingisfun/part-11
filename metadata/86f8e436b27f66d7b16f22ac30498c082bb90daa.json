I have been playing their Culprit and the King album for 24 years now and it is still as enjoyable as it was then. \n\nFM was a Canadian band formed by Nash The Slash and his friends Cameron Hawkins and Martin Deller. Tonight album has been named as a &quot;The Cars Record they never recorded&quot;.  \n\nAnd you surely remember John Watts of the great band Fischer Z. This is his solo work.\n\nAnd roaring Boys debut and only lp is a fantastic new romantic music but very hard to find these days. Please help me in seeding once yo're done.\n\n\nFM - Tonight [1987]\n\nJohn Watts - One More Twist [1982]\n\nRoaring Boys - Roaring Boys [1986]\n\nThe Mockers - Culprit and the King [1985]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f8e436b27f66d7b16f22ac30498c082bb90daa","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+56%5D+New+Wave%2C+New+Romantic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f8e436b27f66d7b16f22ac30498c082bb90daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,248,228,54,178,127,102,215,177,111,34,172,48,73,140,8,43,185,13,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
