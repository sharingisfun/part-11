The new wave band Single Bullet Theory formed in Richmond, VA, in 1976 as X-Breed, a group featuring vocalist Michael Maurice Garrett, Frank Daniel on guitar and drummer Dennis Madigan. The band changed its name to Single Bullet Theory after Gary Alan Holmes (guitar) and Davey Wynn (bass) joined. Single Bullet Theory was signed to Nemperor Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records. The video for &quot;Keep It Tight&quot; was added to MTV in 1984, but CBS abruptly stopped promoting it. &quot;Hang On to Your Heart&quot; was supposed to be Single Bullet Theory's breakthrough single but CBS never released it. Tours with The Pretenders, Ramones, Simple Minds and Romantics follow, but increasingly disillusioned by CBS' lack of support, the band breaks up before releasing another LP. &quot;Keep It Tight&quot; was later released on Rhino Records' &quot;Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the 80's, Volume 9&quot;. Members of SBT went on to form Ten Ten, but this was short-lived. \n\nA1 Keep It Tight    \nA2 Slide Away    \nA3 Hang On to Your Heart    \nA4 A Blink of an Eye    \nA5 Das Madchen    \nB1 There Is the Boy    \nB2 Too Hot to Handle    \nB3 Neutralizer    \nB4 Anxious    \nB5 Dead End Again    \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87077d180b89ef5ff01e2b15540b5fe16d333b69","amp;dn":"Single+Bullet+Theory+-+Single+Bullet+Theory+%5B1982%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87077d180b89ef5ff01e2b15540b5fe16d333b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,7,125,24,11,137,239,95,240,30,43,21,84,11,95,225,109,51,59,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
