So far I like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8735c8bcf3f16b22c9a06030549233da6321de5a","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+August+18%2C+2014+%5BALL-VERSIONS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8735c8bcf3f16b22c9a06030549233da6321de5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,53,200,188,243,241,107,34,201,160,96,48,84,146,51,218,99,33,222,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
