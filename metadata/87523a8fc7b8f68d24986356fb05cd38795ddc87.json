Episodes include Power and the People, deals with the governance of China, The Women, talks about the past and future for Chinese women, Shifting Nature, looks at China's environmental challenges, and Freedom, explores China's conflict between personal freedom and governance.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Women of the Country \nChina's women have always been under pressure: from men, from family, from work. Now more and more are under new pressure -- from themselves -- to take control of their lives; to get an education; to have a career; to marry for love. It's a slow, difficult process, and it is changing China. Mass migration from the countryside to the cities is increasing prosperity, but fracturing families. It also gives women new roles -- whether running the farm back home, or as wage-earners in the city. Xiao Zhang has lived in Beijing for 14 years, cooking and cleaning. This episode follows her home to her village 600 miles away for Chinese New Year, where she is reunited with the children she hasn't seen for a year. The cameras capture the visit of the local Birth Planning Officer to check on young wives, the plight of unwanted girl babies and abortion issues, and a village wedding which turns nasty.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img248/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img248/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img696/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img696/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img252/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img252/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img689/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img689/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1763 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 56.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87523a8fc7b8f68d24986356fb05cd38795ddc87","amp;dn":"PBS+China+from+the+Inside+2of4+Women+of+the+Country+PDTV+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87523a8fc7b8f68d24986356fb05cd38795ddc87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,82,58,143,199,184,246,141,36,152,99,86,251,5,205,56,121,93,220,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
