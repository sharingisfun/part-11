However, her mother, Amy, (Mimi Rogers) doesn't think she's responsible enough, and her stepfather (Christopher McDonald) is allergic to fur. So when Eva harbors a monkey named Dodger who's run away from his abusive pickpocket master (Harvey Keitel), she tries to keep her new friend a secret. It becomes exceedingly difficult, especially when the well-trained Dodger starts stealing everything in sight.\n================================================================================\nMonkey Trouble.avi 1:36:04\n560x312\n24 fps\n714MB\n\nAudio:\nEnglish\nNo subtitles\nStereo\n128kb/s bitrate\n48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875515b19f006d84f618412084355da11187b9ed","amp;dn":"Monkey+Trouble+%281994%29+-+Thora+Birch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875515b19f006d84f618412084355da11187b9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,85,21,177,159,0,109,132,246,24,65,32,132,53,93,161,17,135,185,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
