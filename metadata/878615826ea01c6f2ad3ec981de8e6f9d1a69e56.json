(from UK)\nFen are a musical project inspired by the bleak, esoteric landscapes of Eastern England. They blend aspects of black metal and post-rock to express loss, sorrow, exaltation and a sense of ancient pride through music.\n\nThe band was formed in early 2006 by Grungyn, Theutus and The Watcher, and in 2007 Draugluin joined in. In early 2010, Draugluin was replaced by Ãƒâ€ ÃƒÂ°elwalh.\n\nThe band have released one EP, Ã¢â‚¬Å“]Ancient SorrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2007, under Northern Silence), and two full-lengths, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Malediction FieldsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2009, under Code666), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“EpochÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2011, under Code666).
