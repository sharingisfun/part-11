HUMPP\n\nDirected by Emilio Vieyra\nU.S. version co-directed by Jerald Intrator\n\nMPEG-4 files including U.S. theatrical film (89 minutes) and trailer\n\nFeature ripped from DVD at 1100 kbs\n640 x 480\n\nAudio: AAC 2ch at 128 kbs\n\nLanguage: English (dubbed)\n\nA mad(?) scientist conducts bizarre experiments using the power generated by his human subjects' sexual activity to keep himself young and vital. Subjects are mostly female, somehow, and usually kidnapped. One man's tragic fate, after innumerable sexual encounters, is to become a monster like the one in Frankenstein\n\nOf course it makes little sense, and there's lots of extra sexual padding thanks to U.S. importer Jerald Intrator.\n\nOne of Something Weird Video's first DVD releases -- it's that good!\n\nSee it with Vieyra's Placer sangriento (U.S. version: FEAST OF FLESH a.k.a. The Deadly Organ), another sexy horror show.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b5fce67f79e3ae96460aa940a666a7ddf7ea5a","amp;dn":"The+Curious+Dr.+Humpp+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b5fce67f79e3ae96460aa940a666a7ddf7ea5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,181,252,230,127,121,227,174,150,70,10,169,64,166,102,167,221,247,234,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
