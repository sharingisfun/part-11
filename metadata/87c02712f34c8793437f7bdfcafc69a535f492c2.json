Baro is a deeply moving album that takes the music of Mali in new and exciting directions. \nKoite has been praised in hundreds of newspapers and magazines, including People, Rolling Stone and The New York Times. He has been featured on major national radio and television programs such NPR&amp;#039;s &quot;All Things Considered,&quot; PRI&amp;#039;s &quot;The World,&quot; and &quot;CNN WorldBeat.&quot; Koite became one of the few African artists to break into mainstream pop radio with his popular single &quot;Wassiye.&quot; Among his expanding legions of devoted fans are Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt. \nBaro continues where Ma Ya left off, with a set of haunting melodies and virtuoso guitar playing. Habib is backed by Keletigui Diabate, Mali&amp;#039;s undisputed king of the balafon (a West African wooden-keyed xylophone), who recorded with Lionel Hampton in the 1960s. With the support of the rest of the talented members of Bamada, Koite swings from the Cuban-influenced grooves of &quot;Batoumanbe&quot; to the ethereal and entrancing &quot;Sinamaw.&quot; The acoustic, unadorned arrangements reflect centuries of Malian tradition, while incorporating subtle Western influences to create songs that appeal to people from all walks of life. Baro even includes a new, Latin-style version of Koite&amp;#039;s first hit &quot;Cigarette A Bana,&quot; the track that made him a star in West Africa and earned him the prestigious Radio France International Discoveries Prize in 1992. \nBaro promises to propel Koite to even greater heights. Stunningly beautiful and lyrical, rooted in tradition yet broadly accessible, Baro is the next giant step in the career of an artist who is fast becoming an international luminary. \n\nTracklist:\n\nBatoumambe \nKanawa \nWari \nSin djen djen \nCigarette Abana \nWoulaba \nBaro \nSambara \nRoma \nTere \nMali Sadio \nTakamba \nSinama Denw \n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c02712f34c8793437f7bdfcafc69a535f492c2","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Habib+Koit%C3%A9+%26+Bamada+-+Baro+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c02712f34c8793437f7bdfcafc69a535f492c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,192,39,18,243,76,135,147,67,127,123,223,202,252,105,165,53,244,146,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
