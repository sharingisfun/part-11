The author's infectious enthusiasm is put to use in explaining many of the key concepts in the field, starting with the Golden Number and taking the reader on a geometrical journey via Shapes and Solids, through the Fourth Dimension, finishing up with Einstein's Theories of Relativity.\n\nAimed at a general readership, the text makes accessible complex subjects such as Chaos and Fractals. It includes a wealth of the author's own illustrations and features appendices on related topics.\n\nEqually suitable as a gift for a youngster or as a nostalgic journey back into the world of mathematics for older readers, John Barnes' book is the perfect antidote for anyone whose maths lessons at school are a source of painful memories. Where once geometry was a source of confusion and frustration, Barnes brings enlightenment and entertainment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f7ddb58cfab85516267a6f4a5f7ff44ece3d13","amp;dn":"Gems+of+Geometry+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f7ddb58cfab85516267a6f4a5f7ff44ece3d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,247,221,181,140,250,184,85,22,38,122,111,74,95,127,244,78,206,61,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
