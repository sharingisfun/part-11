Listening to these songs in chronological order makes you wonder why a lesser heard gem like &quot;The Dedication Song&quot; didn't achieve the same lofty place in AM pop history as &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; or &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans.&quot; Definitive versions of &quot;Palisades Park,&quot; &quot;Abigail Beecher,&quot; and &quot;Action&quot; sound great remastered, as do the more obscure numbers like &quot;Twistin' All Night Long,&quot; from 1962 featuring Danny &amp; the Juniors and &quot;Let's Put the Fun Back in Rock N Roll,&quot; recorded in 1981 with the Belmonts. This fine package certainly won't disappoint the &quot;Boom Boom&quot; novice or collector, because, after all, fun is timeless and this disc has that in spades! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880d4cb3604266b0352e43b4696dfc92d685bd3c","amp;dn":"Freddy+Cannon+-+Boom+Boom+Rock+%27n%27+Roll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880d4cb3604266b0352e43b4696dfc92d685bd3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,13,76,179,96,66,102,176,53,46,67,180,105,109,252,146,214,133,189,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
