Thouless' &quot;Straight and Crooked Thinking&quot; that was uploaded by the editor of neglectedbooks.com \n\nA classic on fallacies and argumentation IMO. \n\nHe reformatted a copy scanned in from the 1952 Pan Books (UK) paperback edition which is now public domain in the U.S. (since there wasn't an original copyright notice plus it fell within the 'year conditions') and most other countries that signed the Berne Convention. \n\nHodder education has recently done up a nice hardcover edition and requested that the editor of neglectedbooks.com remove the link he posted. Original post here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://neglectedbooks.com/?p=336&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://neglectedbooks.com/?p=336&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe request has no legal basis so *screw* them. This book is far too precious to be wasted by restricting its distribution due to a silly publisher arguing that it will kill their revenue. \n\nAs of this writing, the PDF can still be found on the server at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://neglectedbooks.com/Straight_and_Crooked_Thinking.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://neglectedbooks.com/Straight_and_Crooked_Thinking.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThere are copies floating around here and there too. Just use Google ;-)\n\n\nHave fun and spread this as far and wide as possible by uploading to file lockers, other P2P networks, Google Docs, Scribd etc. \n\n\n~PDWarrior","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:885b1086ec1f858c77946e90edb85104739b1a62","amp;dn":"Straight+and+Crooked+Thinking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"885b1086ec1f858c77946e90edb85104739b1a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,91,16,134,236,31,133,140,119,148,110,144,237,184,81,4,115,155,26,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
