Waits, along with wife and collaborator Kathleen Brennan, wrote songs for an avant-garde production of &quot;Woyzeck&quot; directed by Robert Wilson, which premiered in November 2000 at the Betty Nansen Theater in Copenhagen and went on to win Denmark's version of the Tony for Best Musical. The album careens from the brutal to the tender with assaulting rhythms and romantic melodies. It's a grim musical deposition on the human condition, a dark mortality play where Tin Pan Alley meets the Weimer Republic.&quot;Blood Money is flesh and bone, earthbound,&quot; said Waits. &quot;The songs are rooted in reality: jealousy, rage, the human meat wheel...They are more carnal. I like a beautiful song that tells you terrible things. We all like bad news out of a pretty mouth. I like songs to sound as though they've been aging in a barrel and distressed.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel &amp; Track Listing\n\nAll tracks written by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan.\n\n\n1.&quot;Misery Is the River of the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Piano, Calliope\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nBebe Risenfors - Bass Clarinet\nGino Robair - Marimba, Bells, Gongs\nMules Patterson - Pod\n\n2.&quot;Everything Goes to Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar, Chamberlain\nMatthew Sperry - Bass\nGino Robair - Bongos &amp; Timpani\nColin Stetson - Baritone Sax\nDon Plonsey - Clarinet\nBebe Risenfors - Accordion\n\n3.&quot;Coney Island Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Piano, Chamberlain\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nMatt Brubeck - Cello\nAra Anderson - Trumpet\nColin Stetson - Sax\n\n4.&quot;All the World Is Green&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nMatt Brubeck - Cello\nColin Stetson - Clarinet\nBent Clausen - Marimba\n\n5.&quot;God's Away on Business&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Electric Guitar\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nStewart Copeland - Drums &amp; Log Drums\nJoe Gore - Electric Guitar\nNik Phelps - Trumpet, Baby Tuba\nBent Clausen - Pod\nColin Stetson - Bass Clarinet\nCharlie Musselwhite - Harmonica\n\n6.&quot;Another Man's Vine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Piano\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nColin Stetson - Baritone Horn, Tenor &amp; Alto Sax\nAndrew Borger - Marimba\n\n7.&quot;Knife Chase&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26 (Instrumental) \n\nTom Waits - Piano\nLarry Taylor - Bass, Electric Guitar\nMyles Boisen - Guitar\nBebe Risenfors - Sax, Bass Clarinet\nCasey Waits - Drums\nBent Clausen - Bass Drums\nAra Anderson - Trumpet\nColin Stetson - Sax\n\n8.&quot;Lullaby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar\nMatt Brubeck - Cello\nDawn Harms - Stroh Violin, Violin\n\n9.&quot;Starving in the Belly of a Whale&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Piano, Chamberlain, Electric Guitar\nLarry Taylor - Bass\nCharlie Musselwhite - Harmonica\nMatt Brubeck - Cello\nDawn Harms - Violin\nColin Stetson - Bass Clarinet\nGino Robair - Floor Toms\n\n10.&quot;The Part You Throw Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar\nMatt Brubeck - Bass &amp; Cello\nDawn Harms - Violin\nColin Stetson - Clarinet\n\n11.&quot;Woe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:20 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Piano\nDawn Harms - Stroh Violin, Violin\nMatt Brubeck - Cello\n\n12.&quot;Calliope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59 (Instrumental) \n\nTom Waits - Calliope, Toy Piano\nNik Phelps - Trumpet\n\n13.&quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 \n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Pump Organ, Calliope\nLarry Taylor - Acoustic Guitar\nMatt Brubeck - Bass\nBebe Risenfors - Clarinet\nDawn Harms - Stroh Violin\nAra Anderson - Trumpet\nAndrew Borger - Marimba\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88a8cbd6635ee8d76a3c4926588abe311cbb69b1","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Blood+Money++%5B2002%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88a8cbd6635ee8d76a3c4926588abe311cbb69b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,168,203,214,99,94,232,215,106,60,73,38,88,138,190,49,28,187,105,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
