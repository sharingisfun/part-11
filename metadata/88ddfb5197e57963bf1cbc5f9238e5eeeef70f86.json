Musa (Nadir Saribacak) is a devout Muslim who is a muezzin at a mosque in a small town. A position at a larger mosque takes him to Istanbul, where the introverted young man feels very much out of place. Musa's new apartment is across the hall from a flat that's home to an elderly woman in poor health, who is looked after by a caretaker named Clara (Gorkem Yeltan). Musa becomes smitten with the lovely Clara as she comes and goes, though he senses that she's just as shy as he is. Clara is friendly with Yakup (Ersan Uysal), a dealer in rare books, and when Yakup hires Musa to do some part-time work cataloging ancient Muslim literature, the muezzin is finally given a proper introduction to Clara. Musa is thrilled to learn that Clara is as interested in him as he is in her, but he also becomes aware of the gulf between them -- not only is Clara a Catholic, until recently she was also a nun. Uzak Ihtimal (aka The Wrong Rosary) was the first feature film from director Mahmut Fazil Coskun.\n\nRip Specs\n\nFile Name ...............................: Mahmut Fazil Coskun-Uzak ihtimal ('Wrong Rosary') (2009).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) .................: 1,151,393,792\nRuntime ..................................: 1:27:20\n\nVideo Codec ..........................: XviD 1.2.2 Final\nFrame Size .............................: 720 x 320 (AR: 2.35)\nFPS .........................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ..........................: 1300 Kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..........................: 0.226 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.....: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nNo. of audio streams .............: 1 (in Turkish with French and English subtitles)\nAudio Codec ..........................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...........................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ..........................: 448 Kb/s tot, 6 chnls (3/2.1), CBR\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1366981/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1366981/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Turkish\nSubtitles: English, French\n\nUzak Ihtimal aka The Wrong Rosary (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88ddfb5197e57963bf1cbc5f9238e5eeeef70f86","amp;dn":"Uzak+Ihtimal+aka+The+Wrong+Rosary+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88ddfb5197e57963bf1cbc5f9238e5eeeef70f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,221,251,81,151,229,121,99,191,28,188,95,146,56,229,238,238,247,15,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
