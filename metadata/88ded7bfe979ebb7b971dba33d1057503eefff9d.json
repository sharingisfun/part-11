Joel Simon, with over 16 years of experience in the field, demonstrates how this therapy can help clients think of possibilities, rather than limitations, when facing death or the loss of a loved one.\n\nThis book presents a general overview of solution focused practice, tools, and methodologies for practitioners. Simon also provides real-life vignettes and verbatim transcripts from actual patients in end-of-life or bereavement counseling. This book provides insight into the philosophy and practice of solution focused therapy, as applied to clients with life-limiting conditions and their loved ones.\n\nKey topics discussed:\n\nThe use of language in solution focused practice: theory, meaning making, and the role of emotions\nTools of solution-building, with questions, troubleshooting guidelines, and tips for evaluating outcomes\nThe distinction between problem-solving and solution-building\nCo-constructing goals with clients\nApplying solution focused principles to hospice, grief, and bereavement practice\nThis resource serves as an invaluable tool for social workers, hospice workers, psychologists, and other bereavement and grief-counseling professionals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88ded7bfe979ebb7b971dba33d1057503eefff9d","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Solution+Focused+Practice+in+End-of-Life+and+Grief+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88ded7bfe979ebb7b971dba33d1057503eefff9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,222,215,191,233,121,235,183,185,113,219,163,61,16,87,80,62,239,255,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
