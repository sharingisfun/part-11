I have not seen it being posted on any blogs and few here wanted it, so here you go people! A review on this LP is below (not my review but I agree with it in general):\n\nThe only full-length release from the Plastercene Replicas, &quot;GLOW&quot; was a brilliant release, highlighted by the very distinctive vocals of Charlie Salmon. Most people's introduction to the band came courtesy of the excellent video for Salmon's &quot;We Can Walk&quot;, as well as its follow-up, the Stephen Stewart-sung &quot;All I See&quot;. As a step forward from their self-title EP of several years previous, &quot;GLOW&quot; shows a band more fully in focus on their sound. The recording is bright and jangly, with a host of drummers sitting in, Spinal Tap-like, as able backing for guitarist/vocalists Salmon and Stewart and bassist/vocalist Brendan Cavin. Like the Jellyfish Babies, the Replicas never achieved massive success, but did spawn a piece of Canadian indie music genius, with &quot;We Can Walk&quot; standing out as perhaps the greatest Canadian indie single EVER.\n \n\nTrack listing:\n\n\nA1 We Can Walk\n\nA2 Things You Hold\n\nA3 Doldrums\n\nA4 What Could be Incomplete\n\nA5 Trains\n\nA6 Pull Out\n\nB1 All I See\n\nB2 Hot Sand\n\nB3 Holler\n\nB4 Town Crier\n\nB5 Falling Down the Stairs\n\nB6 You've Got the Way\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88f19faa0ccfaabcceb30d150cad5441b70dcb9b","amp;dn":"Plasterscene+Replicas+-+Glow+%5B1988%5D+Rare+Indie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88f19faa0ccfaabcceb30d150cad5441b70dcb9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,241,159,170,12,207,170,188,206,179,13,21,12,173,84,65,183,13,203,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
