Manji, a ronin warrior of feudal Japan, has been cursed with immortality. To rid himself of this curse and end his life of misery, he must slay one thousand evil men! His quest begins when a young girl seeks his help in taking revenge on her parents' killers . . . and his quest won't end until the blood of a thousand has been spilled!\n\nCreated by Hiroaki Samura and translated by Dana Lewis &amp; Toren Smith. To preserve the integrity of his art, Samura requested that Dark Horse Comics, not &quot;flop&quot; the manga (that is, reverse the pages as if in a mirror). At the time the English translation began its publication in individual monthly issues (1996), flopping was an almost universal practice for translated manga. Instead, Blade of the Immortal was modified for Western readers by the unusual method of cutting up the panels and rearranging them on the page in order to have the action flow from left to right.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89661a96ce15595494971ec36d64d526e391b2dd","amp;dn":"Blade+of+the+Immortal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89661a96ce15595494971ec36d64d526e391b2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,102,26,150,206,21,89,84,148,151,30,195,109,100,213,38,227,145,178,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
