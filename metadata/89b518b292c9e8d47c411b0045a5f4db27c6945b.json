Though wearing rags and covered in dirt, she attracts the attention of Nacib, a cafe owner, who is in desperate need of a new cook. So dire is his situation that he hires the disheveled girl. The savvy young woman quickly proves to be an excellent chef and - once well-scrubbed and decently dressed - an eye-catching beauty. Nacib quickly finds himself the owner of the most prosperous business in town - and the employer of its most sought-after woman.\n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nJorge Amado (1912-2001) was a Brazilian writer of the modernist school. He was the best-known of modern Brazilian writers, his work having been translated into some 49 languages and popularized in film, notably Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands in 1978. His work reflects the image of a mestizo Brazil and is marked by religious syncretism. He depicted a cheerful and optimistic country that was beset, at the same time, with deep social and economic differences.\n\n-----\n\nJorge Amado's Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8604191&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8604191&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89b518b292c9e8d47c411b0045a5f4db27c6945b","amp;dn":"Jorge+Amado+-+Gabriela%2C+Clove+and+Cinnamon+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89b518b292c9e8d47c411b0045a5f4db27c6945b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,181,24,178,146,201,232,212,124,65,27,0,69,165,244,219,39,198,148,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
