And it's the responsibility of network professionals to get routing right. So join Lazaro Diaz, as he takes you through advanced topics and techniques in Cisco routing, from configuring RIPv2 routes for smaller networks, to EIGRP, advanced distance routing, and OSPF, a more complex protocol that brings many more features and greater flexibility to your network. You'll be able to practice configuring all of these protocols using the Packet Tracer demo environment and Lazaro's detailed tutorials.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n    Configuring static and default routes\r\n    Understanding dynamic routing\r\n    Issuing verification commands\r\n    Comparing RIPng and RIPv2\r\n    Using RIP timers\r\n    Configuring an EIGRP feasible successor route\r\n    Exploring EIGRP options\r\n    Introducing the OSPF process ID\r\n    Exploring wildcard masking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89bddfbcdd84e040f9917634580b19bcbc3e97b2","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Advanced+Topics+in+Cisco+Routing%3A+RIPv2%2C+EIGRP%2C+and+OSPF+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89bddfbcdd84e040f9917634580b19bcbc3e97b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,189,223,188,221,132,224,64,249,145,118,52,88,11,25,188,188,62,151,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
