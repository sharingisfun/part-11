Strength in What Remains is a wonderfully written, inspiring account of one man's remarkable American journey and of the ordinary people who helped him-a brilliant testament to the power of will and of second chances. \n\nDeo arrives in America from Burundi in search of a new life. Having survived a civil war and genocide, plagued by horrific dreams, he lands at JFK airport with two hundred dollars, no English, and no contacts. He ekes out a precarious existence delivering groceries, living in Central Park, and learning English by reading dictionaries in bookstores. Then Deo begins to meet the strangers who will change his life, pointing him eventually in the direction of Columbia University, medical school, and a life devoted to healing. Kidder breaks new ground in telling this unforgettable story as he travels with Deo back over a turbulent life in search of meaning and forgiveness.\n\nAn extraordinary writer, Tracy Kidder once again shows us what it means to be fully human by telling a story about the heroism inherent in ordinary people, a story about a life based on hope.\n\n - - -\n\n  Amazon.com Review\nAmazon Best of the Month, September 2009: \n\nStrength in What Remains is an unlikely story about an unreasonable man. Deo was a young medical student who fled the genocidal civil war in Burundi in 1994 for the uncertainty of New York City. Against absurd odds--he arrived with little money and less English and slept in Central Park while delivering groceries for starvation wages--his own ambition and a few kind New Yorkers led him to Columbia University and, beyond that, to medical school and American citizenship. That his rise followed a familiar immigrant's path to success doesn't make it any less remarkable, but what gives Deo's story its particular power is that becoming an American citizen did not erase his connection to Burundi, in either his memory or his dreams for the future. Writing with the same modest but dogged empathy that made his recent Mountains Beyond Mountains (about Deo's colleague and mentor, Dr. Paul Farmer) a modern classic, Tracy Kidder follows Deo back to Burundi, where he recalls the horrors of his narrow escape from the war and begins to build a medical clinic where none had been before. Deo's terrible journey makes his story a hard one to tell; his tirelessly hopeful but clear-eyed efforts make it a gripping and inspiring one to read.\n\n - - -\n\n  Tracy Kidder on &quot;Strength in What Remains&quot; (from Amazon)\n\nStrength in What Remains is the story of Deogratias, a young man from the central African nation of Burundi. In 1993, through no fault of his own, he was forced onto a terrifying journey, a journey that split his life in two. First he made a six-months-long escape, on foot, from ethnic violence in Burundi and from genocide in Rwanda. Then, in a strange twist of fate, he was, as it were, transported to New York City, where it sometimes seemed that his travails had only just begun.\nI met Deo by chance 6 years ago. When I first heard his story, I had one simple thought: I would not have survived. I hoped in part to reproduce that feeling as I retold his story. I also hoped to humanize what, to most westerners anyway, is a mysterious, little-known part of the world. We hear about mass slaughter in distant countries and we imagine that murder and mayhem define those locales. DeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story opens up one of those places into a comprehensible landscapeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and also opens up a part of New York that is designed to be invisible, the service entrances of the upper East Side, the camping sites that homeless people use in Central Park. But above all, I think, this is a book about coming to terms with memories. How can a person deal with memories like DeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, tormenting memories, memories with a distinctly ungovernable quality?\n\nIn the first part of Strength In What Remains, I recount DeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story. In the second part, I tell about going back with him to the stations of his life, in New York and Burundi. So the story that I tell isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t only about the memories that Deo related to me. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also about seeing him overtaken by memoriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½again and again, and sometimes acutely. But Deo didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take me to Burundi just to show me around. Giving me a tour of his past was incidental to what he was up to in the present and the future. His story has a denoument that even now amazes me.\n\nDeo is an American citizen. He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to go back to Burundi. But he has returned continually and keeps on returning, and, amid the postwar wreckage, with the help of friends and family, he has created a clinic and public health system, free to those who canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pay, in a rural villageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½part of a beginning, Deo dreams, of a new Burundi.\n\nThis facility was a pile of rocks when I visited the site in the summer of 2006. By the fall of 2008, it had become a medical center with several new buildings, a trained professional staff, and a fully stocked pharmacy. In its first year of operation it treated 21,000 different patients. (The organization that Deo founded and that sponsors and operates this facility is called Village Health Works.)\n\nDeo was very young when he went through his long travail. Several strangers helped to save him from death and despair in Burundi and New York. So did sheer courage and pluck, and also Columbia University, which he attended as an undergraduate. But when itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s come to dealing with the burden of his memories, the public health system and clinic that he founded has been the nearest thing to a solution. In the end, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s neither forgetting the past nor dwelling on the past that has worked for him. For him the answer has been remembering and acting. I once asked Deo why he had studied philosophy at Columbia. He told me, &quot;I wanted to understand what had happened to me.&quot; In the end, he received what most students of philosophy receiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not answers, but more questions. As I was trying to describe his effort to build a clinic, I found myself writing: &quot;Deo had discovered a way to quiet the questions heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been asking at Columbia. That is, he saw there might be an answer for what troubled him most about the world, an answer that lay in his hands, indeed in his memory. You had to do something.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Tracy Kidder\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a064fcbc56eb2a3b4060ee4befced5f2eca1c18","amp;dn":"STRENGTH+IN+WHAT+REMAINS+-+Tracy+Kidder.+Read+Kidder+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a064fcbc56eb2a3b4060ee4befced5f2eca1c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,6,79,203,197,110,178,163,180,6,14,228,190,252,237,95,46,202,28,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
