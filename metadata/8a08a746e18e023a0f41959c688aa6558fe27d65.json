It&amp;#039;s interesting to note\nthat &quot;The Diary of Jane&quot; was the fastest added song ever, in Hollywood Records&amp;#039;\nHistory, topping such mega stars as Queen.\n\n&quot;You&quot;, was played live for the first time during an all acoustic set at &quot;Concert\nfor a Cause IV&quot; in April of 2006, while the band was still in the recording\nprocess. In a radio interview with shallowbay.com, Burnley revealed that he had\nmistakenly forgotten the chorus of the song during the set.\n\n&quot;Topless&quot;, is an old fan favorite, tracing back to the days before &quot;Saturate&quot;.\nAaron Fink, the band&amp;#039;s guitarist, accidentally revealed that the song would be\nincluded on the album during a radio interview for shallowbay.com.\n\nThe first pressing of the record (all copies that will be in stores as of 8/8)\nwill include The Diary of Jane (acoustic version). It will be deleted\nimmediately after the initial release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a08a746e18e023a0f41959c688aa6558fe27d65","amp;dn":"Breaking_Benjamin-Phobia-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a08a746e18e023a0f41959c688aa6558fe27d65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,8,167,70,225,142,2,58,15,65,149,156,104,138,166,85,143,226,125,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
