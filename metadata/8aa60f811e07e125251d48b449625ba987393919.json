The last two tracks are studio recordings of new compositions recorded in November 1995 (with subsequent overdubs and post-production lasting into 1996). \n\nThe last time Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Alan White had worked together on officially released studio recordings was 1978's Tormato.\n\n1. Siberian Khatru\n2. The Revealing Science of God\n3. America\n4. Onward\n5. Awaken\n6. Roundabout\n7. Starship Trooper \n8. Be the One \n9. That, That Is\n\n\nAwaken is one of my favorite compositions.  Its performed here in its entirety and is excellent as always.  Wakemans Pipe Organ is recorded well and with the right playback equipment will loosen your floorboards.......!\n\nRipped to FLAC with dBpoweramp in Secure Mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa60f811e07e125251d48b449625ba987393919","amp;dn":"YES+Keys+To+Ascension+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa60f811e07e125251d48b449625ba987393919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,166,15,129,30,7,225,37,37,29,72,180,73,98,91,169,135,57,57,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
