The classic sound of the past meets the voices of the future in this hip selection. \nThe children of the bossa nova generation are now coming of age, and while many originally rebelled against their parents music they are now returning to it to carry the torch of the bossa nova and classic samba style. A number of the artists who appear on Samba Bossa Nova, Paulo Jobim, Jairzinho Oliveira, and Moreno Veloso, are the children of bossa nova&amp;#039;s biggest stars. Some use contemporary instruments like samplers, turntables and computers to add new elements to the classic bossa sound. Others simply seek to excel at the faithful interpretation of the classics. Still others write new material that does not imitate pure samba and bossa nova, but is clearly inspired by it. \n\nThe result is a &quot;nova bossa nova,&quot; a new bossa nova that maintains recognizable links to the jazzy, samba sounds of a generation ago, while propelling the music forward in new and exciting directions. Romantic, richly melodic, subtly rhythmic, and entrancing, the songs on Samba Bossa Nova is perfect mood music that captures the magic of yesterday and the invention of tomorrow. \n\n\nTracklist:\nQuarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum - Eu e O Meu Amor/Lamento No Morro \nDa Lata - Cores \nJairzinho Oliveira - Papo do PsicÃƒÂ³logo \nJussara Silveira - LÃƒÂ¡ Vem a Baiana \nMoreno Veloso - Deusa do Amor \nJorge AragÃƒÂ£o - Preto, Cor Preta \nEliete Negreiros - Meu Mundo ÃƒÂ© Hoje \nPaulinho Moska - AdmiraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o \nRosa Passos - E Luxo So \nMÃƒÂ¡rcio Faraco - FeitiÃƒÂ§o Da Vila \nRita Ribeiro - Banho Cheiroso\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab7d2188688433ddbf8dfc6cb9284a084463bcd","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Present+-+Samba+Bossa+Nova++by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab7d2188688433ddbf8dfc6cb9284a084463bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,183,210,24,134,136,67,61,219,248,223,198,203,146,132,160,132,70,59,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
