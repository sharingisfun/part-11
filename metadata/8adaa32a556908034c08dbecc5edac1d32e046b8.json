We in London are profoundly grateful to our colleagues in Dublin Ã¢â‚¬â€ to, above all, Homan Potterton, the Director of the National Gallery of Ireland, and to the Board of Governors and Guardians Ã¢â‚¬â€ for allowing us to borrow and display a notable group of their paintings, ranging widely in school and period but united by quality.\n\nThe exhibition brings to Trafalgar Square work by several fine artists not\nrepresented in our permanent Collection Ã¢â‚¬â€ among them, Castiglione, Bellotto, Frans\nPost, Gerard and Nolde Ã¢â‚¬â€ and some outstanding examples by famous figures like El\nGreco, Titian and Poussin, which extend significantly our own holdings of their art.\nSo much for the immediate and narrow view of this exhibition. For those who\ncannot visit, or have not bothered to visit, the National Gallery in Merrion Square, a choice selection has been brought to London for their delectation. But it is very much a selection, governed by reasons of conservation and space, as well as taste; and my strongest hope is that it will serve to stimulate appetite and appreciation and that more people will be encouraged to visit Dublin and the National Gallery of Ireland, to discover the full range of a great Ã¢â‚¬â€ and growing Ã¢â‚¬â€ collection. They will also discover, incidentally, a city of beautiful architecture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8adaa32a556908034c08dbecc5edac1d32e046b8","amp;dn":"Masterpieces+from+the+National+Gallery+of+Ireland+%28Art+Ebook%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8adaa32a556908034c08dbecc5edac1d32e046b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,218,163,42,85,105,8,3,76,8,219,236,197,237,172,29,50,224,70,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
