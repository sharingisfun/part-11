The band is managed by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals, and is best known today for a string of (mainly) mid-1970s hit singles that are staples of classic rock radio, as well as several earlier acid rock albums. Steve Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landmark contract with Capitol Records in 1967, the band shortened its name to 'Steve Miller Band'. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album Children of the Future. They went on to produce albums Sailor, Brave New World, Your Saving Grace, Number 5, Rock Love and more. The Steve Miller BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Greatest Hits 1974-1978, released in 1978, sold over 13 million copies. They continued to produce more albums and in 2014, Steve Miller Band is touring with the rock band Journey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8adbc85ece93e57abde3700f710f37a398028641","amp;dn":"The+Steve+Miller+Band+-+Shake+Your+Tree+%5B1973%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8adbc85ece93e57abde3700f710f37a398028641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,219,200,94,206,147,229,122,189,227,112,15,113,15,55,163,152,2,134,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
