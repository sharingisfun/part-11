Robert Stack is a disillusioned World War One ace eking out a living as a barnstorming pilot/parachutist during the early 1930s. New Orleans newspaperman Rock Hudson runs across Stack at a two-bit carnival. He becomes fascinated with Stack's fall from grace, and latches onto him. As he is drawn into Stack's iconoclastic, individualistic lifestyle, Hudson finds he is also drawn to the pilot's long-suffering wife, Dorothy Malone. Jack Carson is on hand as Stack's chief mechanic, whose anger over the pilot's abusive treatment of Malone explodes into tragedy.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051055/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051055/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-51055/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-51055/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:04\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x304 2.37:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1001 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,19 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b11f0a9940c2b3772cf74b5b332c21e4cb2eb27","amp;dn":"The+Tarnished+Angels+%281957+Rock+Hudson+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b11f0a9940c2b3772cf74b5b332c21e4cb2eb27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,17,240,169,148,12,43,55,114,207,116,181,179,50,194,30,76,178,235,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
