Uploaded because the other Targets rip seems to be dead or something and not everyone can get to the one on Demonoid. This is going to be very slow to begin with and slow onwards unless people seed.\n\nIMDB Plot Description: Elderly horror-film star who, while making a personal appearance at a drive-in theater, confronts a psychotic Vietnam veteran who&amp;#039;s turned into a mass-murdering sniper.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063671/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063671/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDOWNLOAD THE SAMPLE! The picture is better in the real thing but please check to see if the audio meets your standards as I think it is VERY SLIGHTLY out of sync (my computer seems to suck for ripping, got it as close as I could to being in sync). Let me know if there are any problems I didn&amp;#039;t notice, it isn&amp;#039;t the best rip in the world.\n\nVideo: 640x352 DivX Codec\n\nAudio: 160kbps\n\nSize 1.21 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bab3e04feb2912de4fb24a9667a0ac7e3580cc8","amp;dn":"Targets+%281968%29+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bab3e04feb2912de4fb24a9667a0ac7e3580cc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,171,62,4,254,178,145,45,228,251,36,169,102,122,10,199,227,88,12,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
