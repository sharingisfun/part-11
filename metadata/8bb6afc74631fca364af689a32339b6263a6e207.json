Also, although we will see in their  videos  Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; Hite as singer , their most famous songs were made by Alan &quot;Blind Owl&quot; Wilson, a musical genius, the best harpist of  the world according John Lee Hooker,  and who died in 1970, a very special year for losses of .rock stars .\n\nLuckily, &quot;The Bear&quot; replaced to  him on incredible way. On this gig is at its peak as band singer and  it still seems  a really fun show to watch,  even we get to see Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; playing guitar and the add  of Clarence Gatemouth Brown is really great . Definitely this video is a great blast from the past.  Fortunately  Canned Heat has left a long legacy.  Maybe,  IÃ‚Â´m sharing  too much  music  from those years , maybe all this be  rare stuff to you . If so, I hope at less all  these rare stuff  will  it be interesting to see...\n\n\n\nCanned Heat - Live at Montreux Jazz Festival, 1973 \n\nStarring    :  \n\nBob Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe BearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hite: vocal, harmonica, bass\nEd Beyer: keyboards\nHenry Vestine: guitar\nFito De La Parra: drums\nRichard Hite: bass\nJames Shane:guitar\nClarence 'Gatemouth' Brown (Guess)\n\nColor, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC\n\nLanguage: English\n\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nStudio: Eagle Rock Entertainment\n\nDVD Release Date: September 19, 2006\n\nRun Time: 73 minutes\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
