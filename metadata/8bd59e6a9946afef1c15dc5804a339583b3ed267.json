Rex was an English rock band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Marc Bolan. The band formed as Tyrannosaurus Rex, releasing four underground acoustic albums under the name. Tony Visconti (their producer for several albums) claimed in a documentary on the band that he had taken to using the abbreviated term &quot;T. Rex&quot; as a shorthand, something that initially irritated Bolan, who gradually came around to the idea and officially shortened the band's name to &quot;T. Rex&quot; at roughly the same time they started having big hits (shortly after going electric).\n\nIn the early to mid 1970s, the band reached huge success with fourteen top-20 UK glam rock hits: &quot;Jeepster&quot;, &quot;Get It On&quot;, &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold Easy Action&quot;, &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;, &quot;Hot Love&quot;, &quot;Telegram Sam&quot;, &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;, &quot;Debora&quot;, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, &quot;The Groover&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot;, &quot;I Love To Boogie&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot;. During this period the band also released six UK top-30 albums, including Electric Warrior, which hit the top of the album charts. In 1977, Bolan was killed in a car accident, and the band broke up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Slider is the seventh studio album by English glam rock act T. Rex, released on 21 July 1972 by record labels EMI and Reprise. Two singles, &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot;, were released to promote the album.\n\nThe Slider received acclaim from critics, and reached number 4 in the UK charts and number 17 in the US.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nMarc Bolan: vocals, guitar\nSteve Currie: bass guitar\nMickey Finn: percussion, vocals\nBill Legend: drums\nHoward Kaylan: background vocals\nMark Volman: background vocals\nTony Visconti: string arrangements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd59e6a9946afef1c15dc5804a339583b3ed267","amp;dn":"T.+Rex+-+The+Slider+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B1972%5D%5B2002%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BDE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd59e6a9946afef1c15dc5804a339583b3ed267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,213,158,106,153,70,175,239,28,21,220,88,4,163,57,88,59,62,210,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
