Werewolves and cats are natural enemies but the power of their sexual chemistry overwhelms them. She steals his heart and makes him whole. When she abandons him it fractures his world, and he knows no woman can ever take her place. Though many seek his attention, he is cold and unattainable.\n\nThe love they share is soul deep, but the fate of CharmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family lies in her hands. The memory of every heated touch they share will cut out both their hearts when she leaves him, but to save them all she must run. After nine years of desolation and heartbreak, Charma is back. She risks forfeiting her life to warn Brand of an impending attack, but she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate. Brand has her in his arms once more, and he will never lose her","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3fbed389ce0879763d4fe4a58cbd834fce60fe","amp;dn":"MatingBrandUnabridged.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3fbed389ce0879763d4fe4a58cbd834fce60fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,63,190,211,137,206,8,121,118,61,79,228,165,140,189,131,79,206,96,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
