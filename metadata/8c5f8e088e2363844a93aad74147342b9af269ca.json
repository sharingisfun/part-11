Crumb, Gilbert Shelton, and Art Spiegelman) paved the way. These cartoonists, inspired by the freewheeling creative energy of the underground comix movement, began drawing and printing their own comix. The most popular format was an 8 1/2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ x 11Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sheet, folded twice, and printed at local, pre-Kinkos print shops on letter-size paper; because of the small size, they were dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Å“mini comix.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As they evolved many different artists, one by one, became interested in this do-it-yourself phenomenon. By the 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s they became known as Newave Comix, a term taken from EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Newave rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll movement. An explosion of do-it-yourself artists emerged. Many talented artists went onto bigger and better things, others have disappeared into the fog never to be heard from again. Inspired by the creative freedom of their underground predecessors and unrestrained by commercial boundaries or editorial edicts, their work was particularly innovative and experimental. Here you will find a group of artists who could not get any attention from the mainstream, who were driven by the inner need to express themselves. This group was a pioneering force that still leaves a wake and an imprint on the alternative comix scene today.\n\nNewave! features over 800 pages of comics (click here to read the full Table of Contents), as well as a historical introduction by editor Michael Dowers (click here to read), and interviews with several of the more prominent artists featured, such as Brad Foster, Artie Romero, Steve Willis, Dennis Worden, Bob X, J.R. Williams, Roger May, Tom Hosier, George Erling, and Bob Vojtko.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Newave is not about artsploitation. Newave is about ideas. Nothing is taboo. Nothing is censored. No one is told what or what not to draw... Newave is social, political, rebellious, humorous, irreverent, libelous, inane, argumentative, blasÃƒÂ©, blatant, belligerent, blasphemous, insane, kinky, ridiculous, absurd, loving, sleazy, and topical. Newave is back talk... Newave is the child of instant printing. Anyone can learn it. Anyone can participate. There are no aristocrats of newave, no comix stars. Newave is communication returned to people. It is out of the control of the mind manipulators...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Excerpts from Clay GeerdesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Newave Manifesto, 1983","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5f8e088e2363844a93aad74147342b9af269ca","amp;dn":"Newave+-+The+Underground+Mini+Comix+of+the+1980s+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5f8e088e2363844a93aad74147342b9af269ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,95,142,8,142,35,99,132,74,147,170,215,65,71,52,43,154,242,105,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
