I'm in no way trying to steal anyone else's thunder for the scanning they've done, I'm only looking to share fun comics.\n\nAlso, if you like the Cavewoman stuff I strongly recommend visiting Basement Comics website. They have a lot of stuff and they're very fairly priced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ccb8593579fb3a702db080570d8936890877422","amp;dn":"Cavewoman+Primal.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ccb8593579fb3a702db080570d8936890877422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,203,133,147,87,159,179,167,2,219,8,5,112,216,147,104,144,135,116,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
