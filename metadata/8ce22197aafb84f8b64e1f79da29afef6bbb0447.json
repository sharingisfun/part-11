Jones \nFormat: M4B \nUnabridged\n\nPart of the Coda Series\n\nJared Thomas has lived his whole life in the small mountain town of Coda, Colorado. He can't imagine living anywhere else. Unfortunately, the only other gay man in town is twice his age and used to be his teacher, so Jared is resigned to spending his life alone.\n\nUntil Matt Richards walks into his life, that is. Matt has just been hired by the Coda Police Department, and he and Jared immediately become friends. Matt claims he is straight, but for Jared, having a sexy friend like Matt is way too tempting. Facing MattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affair with a local woman, his disapproving family, and harassment from MattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s co-workers, Jared fears they'll never find a way to be togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€if he can even convince Matt to try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce22197aafb84f8b64e1f79da29afef6bbb0447","amp;dn":"Promises+by+Marie+Sexton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce22197aafb84f8b64e1f79da29afef6bbb0447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,226,33,151,170,251,132,248,182,78,31,121,218,41,175,239,107,187,4,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
