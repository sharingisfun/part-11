Separated from his wife, whom he loves passionately, he is torn between an unrelenting approach to solving serial killings and his attempts to rekindle his marriage. Luther is a highly charged emotional man who is not above stretching the law to solve a case or save a life. In episode one, Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) proves she is equally brilliant by committing the perfect murder of her parents, which challenges Luther as never before. Alice develops a strange fascination for Luther and their continued exchanges and interplay serve as a backdrop for the rest of the season. Luther's edgy police tactics make him a serious concern to his superiors, who feel that he is a threat to their reputations and that of the Police force. From the opening credits to the end of season one, &quot;Luther&quot; is a fast paced mystery presented with many plot twists and insights into the human psyche.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3c2bec342a4f76c211bd03753d2267bd2ee661","amp;dn":"Luther+S01+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3c2bec342a4f76c211bd03753d2267bd2ee661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,60,43,236,52,42,79,118,194,17,189,3,117,61,34,103,189,46,230,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
