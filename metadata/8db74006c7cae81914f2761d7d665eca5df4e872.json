Throughout their 20-year tenure Sloan has released nine LPs (one being a double), two EPs, a live album, a &quot;best of&quot; collection and no less than thirty singles. The band is known for their sharing of songwriting from each member of the group and their unaltered line-up throughout their career; a feat that is seldom seen in the Rock music industry.\n\nThe band was formed in 1991 when Chris Murphy and Andrew Scott met at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) in Halifax; Patrick Pentland and Jay Ferguson joined soon after. In 1992 the band created their own record label, Murderecords, for themselves and other Halifax area bands, and released the Peppermint EP.\n\nAccording to Sloan's official website,[1] the band's name refers to a friend's nickname. Their friend Jason Larsen was called Slow One by his French-speaking boss, which with the French accent sounded more like Sloan. The original agreement was that they could name the band after their friend's nickname as long as he was on the cover of their first album. As a result, it is Larsen who appears on the cover of the Peppermint EP.\n\nLater in 1992 Sloan released their full-length album Smeared on Geffen Records. In 1994 Geffen did not promote their second album, Twice Removed, due to artistic disputes,[2] although it sold well in Canada. Spin named it one of the &quot;Best Albums You Didn't Hear&quot; in 1994. A 1996 reader poll by Canadian music magazine Chart! ranked it as the best Canadian album of all time, only two years after its release.[3] The same poll in 2000 ranked the album third, behind Joni Mitchell's Blue and Neil Young's Harvest.[4] However, the 2005 poll once again ranked the album first.[2]\n\nAfter the release of Twice Removed, the band went on hiatus and were rumoured to have broken up, as they had rejected Geffen's offer for their next album.[5] In 1996, however, they released the widely praised One Chord to Another on their own Murderecords label. Following 1998's Navy Blues album, Sloan released their first live album 4 Nights at the Palais Royale in 1999. Those albums were followed by Between the Bridges in 1999, and Pretty Together in 2001.\n\nSloan made a concerted effort to break into the US market on their 2003 release Action Pact. Songs were recorded in L.A. with Tom Rothrock producing. The glossier, radio-ready sound failed to raise Sloan's profile in the US, though they continued to be highly popular in Canada.[6]\n\nSloan's first compilation album A Sides Win: Singles 1992-2005, included two new songs, &quot;All Used Up&quot; and &quot;Try to Make It&quot;. The Japanese release included two additional new tracks.\n\nNow signed to Yep Roc Records for their US releases, they put out their eighth disc, Never Hear the End of It in 2006. The album contained 30 tracks with all the members of the band contributing new songs. It was met with widespread critical acclaim and became the highest charting Sloan album in the US up to that point.\n\nIn 2008, Sloan followed up their longest album with their shortest release Parallel Play.\n\nIn November 2009 Sloan added a digital music store to their website. The band released an online-only EP called Hit &amp; Run to promote the store. The EP featured two songs by Chris Murphy, and one by each of the other band members. Murphy's Take It Upon Yourself was released as a free single. In February 2010, the band released another online exclusive, the compilation album B-Sides Win: Extras, Bonus Tracks and B-Sides 1992 - 2008.\n\nSloan announced plans to release a 10th album in 2011, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of their first show.[8]\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Sloan announced that their new album would be released on May 10, 2011. The album is entitled The Double Cross, a nod to their 20th (or XX) anniversary. The album is preceded by the its first single, &quot;Unkind&quot;.\n\nWith the release of the The Double Cross, Sloan has now released a catalogue of around 175 different songs.\n\nIn promotion of the new album, a special video series produced and directed by Catherine Stockhausen has been launched on YouTube to commemorate the illustrious success of the band. Interviewed in these videos are several musicians and celebrities such as Jason Schwartzman, Joel Plaskett, Stefan Brogren, Dave Foley, Kevin Drew, Buck 65, Ian D'Sa and Benjamin Kowalewicz from Billy Talent, K-OS, and Dave Hamlin.\n\nAll four members of Sloan write their own songs, and when they play live they switch instruments accordingly. Usually the band performs as follows: Murphy is on lead vocals and plays bass, Pentland is also on lead vocals and plays lead guitar, Ferguson plays rhythm guitar, and Scott plays drums.\n\nWhile Murphy has written more of the band's songs than any of the other members, Pentland is nonetheless responsible for having written many of Sloan's most recognizable hits. Perhaps more noteworthy, however, is the fact that every member of the group has contributed at least two songs per album, with only the following exceptions: On 1992's debut LP, Smeared, Scott and Pentland are credited with just one song each, while on 2003's Action Pact, Scott has no songs, for according to Eye Weekly, that album's producer, Tom Rothrock, essentially randomly selected tracks out of the band's submissions in the interest of creating a more streamlined sound. Scott's songwriting output at that time may also have been somewhat diminished because he had recently become a father\n\n\n\n\n\nSmeared 1992\n\n\nSmeared was the first full-length album released by the Canadian rock band Sloan. It was released in Canada in October, 1992, and in the United States in January, 1993, on Geffen Records. Like their first release, the Peppermint EP, it was seen as a noisy pop record reminiscent of Sonic Youth with Beatles-style harmonies. Jennifer Pierce of fellow Halifax, Nova Scotia band Jale sang backup vocals on &quot;I Am the Cancer&quot;. The album was certified Gold in Canada on July 12, 1995.\n\nThe album was ranked 86th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Underwhelmed&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Raspberry&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;I Am the Cancer&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Median Strip&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Take It In&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;500 Up&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Marcus Said&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Sugartune&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Left of Centre&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Lemonzinger&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Two Seater&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;What's There to Decide?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwice Removed 1994\n\n\nTwice Removed is the second album by Canadian rock band Sloan. It was released on Geffen Records in 1994, and is considered to be one of their best albums. It was more melodic and catchy than their previous album, Smeared, and as a result Geffen did not promote it very well because it didn't fit the commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band was dropped from Geffen after Twice Removed was released. Although it was the record that made them famous in Canada, Sloan took time off from touring and writing after the troubles with Geffen, and they were rumoured to have broken up. The album was certified Gold in Canada on October 20, 1998.\n\nJennifer Pierce from Jale appears once again as a backup singer on &quot;I Can Feel It&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Penpals&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;I Hate My Generation&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;People of the Sky&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Coax Me&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Bells On&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Loosens&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Worried Now&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Shame Shame&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Deeper Than Beauty&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Snowsuit Sound&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Before I Do&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;I Can Feel It&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Chord To Another 1996\n\n\n\nOne Chord to Another is the third album by Canadian rock band, Sloan. After rumours that they had broken up following the problems they faced with Geffen Records when Twice Removed was released, Sloan began touring and writing again in 1995 and released One Chord to Another on Murderecords in 1996. Like the previous album it was a catchy, Beatles-influenced pop record. The band also experimented with instruments they had never used before, such as piano, trumpets, and maracas. The album was certified Gold in Canada on November 21, 1996. It also won the award for Best Alternative Album at the 1997 Juno Awards.\n \nIt was ranked 34th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Good in Everyone&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Nothing Left to Make Me Want to Stay&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Autobiography&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Junior Panthers&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;G Turns to D&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;A Side Wins&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Everything You've Done Wrong&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Anyone Who's Anyone&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;The Lines You Amend&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Take the Bench&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Can't Face Up&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;400 Metres&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavy Blues 1998\n\n\nNavy Blues was the fourth album by Canadian rock band Sloan. Released on Murderecords in 1998, it was a little heavier than their previous albums, showing an influence from 1970s rock mixed with their usual catchy, melodic, Beatles-esque sound. The album contains arguably their most popular song, &quot;Money City Maniacs&quot;. &quot;Money City Maniacs&quot; was used in a beer commercial at the time; furthermore, it became a top 10 hit in their native Canada and received heavy radio airplay. The album was certified Gold in Canada on June 12, 1998. Navy Blues was also nominated for Best Rock Album at the 1999 Juno Awards.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;She Says What She Means&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;C'mon C'mon (We're Gonna Get It Started)&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Iggy and Angus&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Sinking Ships&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Keep on Thinkin'&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Money City Maniacs&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Seems So Heavy&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Chester the Molester&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Stand By Me, Yeah&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Suppose They Close the Door&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;On the Horizon&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;I Wanna Thank You&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;I'm Not Through With You Yet&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Nights At The Palais Royale 1999\n\n\n4 Nights at the Palais Royale is a live album released by the Canadian rock band Sloan in 1999. It was recorded from four live shows performed at the Palais Royale in Toronto, Ontario, in 1998 (although some of the songs were taken from other concerts on their 1998 tour). The band and fans alike consider it a fairly accurate representation of a typical Sloan concert, with a mix of old and new songs and plenty of audience participation.\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;She Says What She Means&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;The Good in Everyone&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Coax Me&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;The Lines You Amend&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Marcus Said&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Seems So Heavy&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Sinking Ships&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Everything You've Done Wrong&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Keep on Thinkin'&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Snowsuit Sound&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Suppose They Close the Door&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Iggy and Angus&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Bells On&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Anyone Who's Anyone&quot;  \n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;People of the Sky&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;400 Metres&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;On The Horizon&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;I Wanna Thank You&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;G Turns to D&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Penpals&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Money City Maniacs&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Deeper Than Beauty&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;I Am the Cancer&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;I Can Feel It&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Torn&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Nothing Left to Make Me Want to Stay&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Before I Do&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Underwhelmed&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween The Bridges 1999\n\n\nBetween the Bridges is the fifth album by Canadian rock band Sloan. Released on Murderecords in 1999, it continues the band's progression towards 1970s-influenced rock mixed with 1960s and 1990s-influenced pop. The album marked a pivotal move forward for the group, expanding on their influences like previous Sloan albums and featuring another successful single in their native Canada, &quot;Losing California.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The N.S.&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;So Beyond Me&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Don't You Believe a Word&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Friendship&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Sensory Deprivation&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;All By Ourselves&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;A Long Time Coming&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Waiting for Slow Songs&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Losing California&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;The Marquee and the Moon&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Take Good Care of the Poor Boy&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Delivering Maybes&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty Together 2001\n\n\nPretty Together is the sixth album by Canadian rock group Sloan. It was released on Murderecords in 2001, and is often seen as the band's most mature album. While it still has the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1990s influences of Between the Bridges, it is more melancholy with fewer of the upbeat songs found on previous albums. 'If It Feels Good Do It' and 'The Other Man' were the two major singles from the album, with the latter being a melancholy plea by Chris Murphy which marked an outing from the usual upbeat songs Murphy provides the group with. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2002 Juno Awards.\n\nFrom this album, &quot;If It Feels Good Do It&quot; and &quot;The Other Man&quot; were released as singles. Although the album did not chart or do well in sales, both singles received notable radio airplay.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;If It Feels Good Do It&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;In the Movies&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;The Other Man&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Dreaming of You&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Pick It Up and Dial It&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;The Great Wall&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;The Life of a Working Girl&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Never Seeing the Ground for the Sky&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;It's in Your Eyes&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Who You Talkin' To?&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;I Love a Long Goodbye&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Are You Giving Me Back My Love?&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Your Dreams Have Come True&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Pact 2003\n\n\nAction Pact is the seventh album by Canadian rock band Sloan. It was named after a song by the 1980s Halifax band Jellyfishbabies, called Youth Action Pact. It was released on August 19, 2003 by ViK Recordings.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gimme That&quot; - 2:39\n2.\t&quot;Live On&quot; - 3:11\n3.\t&quot;Backstabbin'&quot; - 2:51\n4.\t&quot;The Rest of My Life&quot; - 2:45\n5.\t&quot;False Alarm&quot; - 3:47\n6.\t&quot;Nothing Lasts Forever Anymore&quot; - 3:18\n7.\t&quot;Hollow Head&quot; - 3:37\n8.\t&quot;Ready for You&quot; - 2:07\n9.\t&quot;I Was Wrong&quot; - 2:52\n10.\t&quot;Who Loves Life More?&quot; - 3:26\n11.\t&quot;Reach Out&quot; - 3:28\n12.\t&quot;Fade Away&quot; - 4:46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sides Win: Singles 1992 - 2005 2005\n\n\nA Sides Win: Singles 1992ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005 is an album by Canadian power pop quartet Sloan.
