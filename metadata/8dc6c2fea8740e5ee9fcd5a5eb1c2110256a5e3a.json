Story coach Lisa Cron has spent decades discovering why these methods rarely work and coming up with a powerful alternative, based on the science of what our brains are wired to crave in every story we read (and itâ€™s not what you think). \r\n\r\nIn this revolutionary guide, Cron helps you crack the story code and create a novel, screenplay, or memoir that will keep readers riveted. Using one novelistâ€™s evolving story as an example throughout, Story Genius takes you step-by-step from the first glimmer of an idea to an expansive, multilayered cause-and-effect blueprint--including fully realized scenes. By plumbing the nitty-gritty details of your raw idea to organically generate your storyâ€™s internal logic, meaning, and urgency, youâ€™ll end up with a first draft that has the authority, richness, and command of a sixth or seventh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc6c2fea8740e5ee9fcd5a5eb1c2110256a5e3a","amp;dn":"Story+Genius+-+Lisa+Cron.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc6c2fea8740e5ee9fcd5a5eb1c2110256a5e3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,198,194,254,168,116,14,94,233,252,213,165,235,28,33,16,37,106,94,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
