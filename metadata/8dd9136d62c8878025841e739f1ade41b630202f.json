While the A-side topped the US Billboard charts for seven weeks starting 18 January 1964, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; entered the Billboard Hot 100 on 8 February 1964, remaining there for 11 weeks, peaking at #14. The song placed on the Cashbox charts for only one week at #100 on the same day of its Billboard debut. In 2004, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; was ranked #139 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song was a Lennon and McCartney collaboration based on McCartney's initial idea. Originally titled &quot;Seventeen&quot;, the song was apparently conceived by McCartney while driving home from a Beatles' concert in Southport, Lancashire as a modern take on the traditional song As I Roved Out, a version of Seventeen Come Sunday that he had heard in Liverpool in 1960. According to Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn, McCartney worked out chords and changes for the song on an acoustic guitar, at the family home of his Liverpool friend and fellow musician Rory Storm, on the same night, 22 October 1962. Two days later, McCartney was writing lines for the song during a visit to London with his then-girlfriend Celia Mortimer, who was seventeen at the time herself. The song was completed about a month later at McCartney's Forthlin Road home with Lennon.\n\nThe first live recording (a slow version of the song) was made at the Cavern Club at the end of 1962. Lennon didn't play rhythm guitar; he played harmonica in the introduction and during the verses. Lennon and McCartney laughed when they sing &quot;Well we danced all night/ And I held her tight/ And I held her hand in mine&quot; the second time.\n\nThe song was recorded at EMI Studios on 11 February 1963 and engineered by Norman Smith, as part of the marathon recording session that produced 10 of the 14 songs on Please Please Me. The Beatles were not present for the mixing session on 25 February 1963. It was not common practice for bands to be present at such sessions at that time.\n\nMcCartney later described in Beat Instrumental how he went about the song's composition: &quot;HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one example of a bit I pinched from someone: I used the bass riff from 'TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ About You' by Chuck Berry in 'I Saw Her Standing There'. I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly. Even now, when I tell people, I find few of them believe me; therefore, I maintain that a bass riff hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got to be original&quot;.\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_Her_Standing_There&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_Her_Standing_There&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lApdfaAfA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lApdfaAfA&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:01:57\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
