His new-found \npositivity suggests that the artist had finally recovered from the death of \nboth his parents, which were so poignantly dealt with on his previous \nreleases Nothing Like The Sun and Soul Cages. As the title suggests, the \nalbum also has mediaeval connections, apparent on biblical track titles such as \n&quot;Saint Augustine In Hell&quot; and &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;. Moreover, in true Chaucerian \nstyle the album even has a &quot;Prologue&quot; and an &quot;Epilogue&quot;. Even though the \ntone of the tracks on Ten Summoner's Tales is less melancholic than earlier \nalbums, Sting still retains the ability to write deep, informed lyrics; &quot;If I Ever \nLose My Faith In You&quot; and &quot;It's Probably Me&quot; are typically classic Sting \nmoments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df106ddad341c6869d64f4e81369424565d3c85","amp;dn":"Sting+-+Ten+Summoners+Tales+%281993%29+FLAC+Soup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df106ddad341c6869d64f4e81369424565d3c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,241,6,221,173,52,28,104,105,214,79,78,129,54,148,36,86,93,60,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
