This is both a sequel and, in some ways, prequel to Kingdom Come, also by Mark Waid. Both books form an Elseworlds saga, meaning they are abstracted from official DC Comics continuity. The storyline extended into one-shot books entitled Gog, The Kingdom: Kid Flash, The Kingdom: Nightstar, The Kingdom: Offspring, The Kingdom: Planet Krypton, and The Kingdom: Son of the Bat. The entire storyline was later collected into a trade paperback.\n\nThe Kingdom does not use the same visual style created by Alex Ross, which was used in the four-issue Kingdom Come series. The storyline in The Kingdom is a direct continuation and extension of the original storyline fleshing out areas of the future that were not explored in the original four-part series. While Kingdom Come can easily exist as a stand-alone story, The Kingdom is not a complete storyline in and of itself and exists only as a continuation of the previous storyline.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom 02 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom - Kid Flash 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom - Son of the Bat 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom - Nightstar 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom - Offspring 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)\nThe Kingdom - Planet Krypton 01 (1999) (GreenRacer-DCP)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e00abb6ce3c7e0e9464cd22d4add31080414bad","amp;dn":"The+Kingdom+Miniseries+%28DC%29+%281999%29+NEW+SCANS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e00abb6ce3c7e0e9464cd22d4add31080414bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,0,171,182,206,60,126,14,148,100,205,34,212,173,211,16,128,65,75,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
