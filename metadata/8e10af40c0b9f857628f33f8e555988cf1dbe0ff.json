For more than half a century Professor Noam Chopsky has captivate audiences with his challenging Grassroots based analysis coupled with an implied or stated call to action. Chomsky is a World renown Linguistics professor from MIT. His clear and concise use of language delivered in his engaging narrative style. Over the years he has developed his own in depth historical analysis influenced by BU professor and activist Howard Zinn. Students at Brown challenge him in the end and his answers provide food for thought.
