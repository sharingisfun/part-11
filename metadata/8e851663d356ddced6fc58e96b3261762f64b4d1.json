Now, Real World Java EE Night HacksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dissecting the Business Tier walks you through the Java EE 6 best practices and patterns used to create a real world application called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œx-ray.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ X-ray is a high-performance blog statistics application built with nothing but vanilla Java EE 6 leveraging the synergies between the JAX-RS, EJB 3.1, JPA 2, and CDI 1.0 APIs. Topics covered include:\n\n A brief introduction into the core principles of Java EE 6 (EJB 3.1, CDI, JPA, JTA,Dependency Injection, Convention over Configuration, interceptors, transactions, REST) using real world code\nUnit and integration testing of Java EE 6 applications using JUnit and ScalaTest\nUsing interceptors for performance measuring and monitoring\nCreating mocks with Mockito for EJB 3.1, CDI, JPA, and JAX-RS\nDeveloping embedded integration tests with Arquillian\nProductive use of JAX-RS, Contexts and Dependency Injection, EJB 3.1, and JPA\nRESTful services and REST clients with Java EE 6\nConvention over Configuration with Java EE 6\nEffective component configuration with CDI and Convention over Configuration\nPlug-in implementation with CDI\nTransactional pub/sub without JMS based on CDI and EJB 3.1\nContinuous integration with Maven 3, Mercurial/Git, and Hudson/Jenkins\nImplementing configurable timers and asynchronous batch processing\nEventual consistency and high-performance deferred writes with Java EE 6\nReal-time client and server monitoring with JMX and REST\nFunctional testing with FitNesse\nPerforming stress and load tests\nSimplest possible, but maintainable, Java EE 6 design and architecture\nReal World Java EE Night Hacks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dissecting the Business Tier will benefit experienced developers and architects interested in code, not PowerPoint slides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e851663d356ddced6fc58e96b3261762f64b4d1","amp;dn":"Real+World+Java+EE+Night+Hacks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e851663d356ddced6fc58e96b3261762f64b4d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,133,22,99,211,86,221,206,214,252,88,233,107,50,97,118,47,100,180,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
