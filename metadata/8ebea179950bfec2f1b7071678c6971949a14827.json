(aka Christopher Wallace/Biggie Smalls) dropped his first album &quot;Ready to Die&quot; in 1994, and took the hiphop world by storm. Back then it was another hot album, today its regarded as one of the best albums ever released, and the Notorious is regarded as a legend. Production on this masterpiece comes from Easy Mo Bee, DJ Premier, Norman &amp; Digga, Darnell Scott, Carl Thompson and Jean Oliver, and these producers bless the album with excellent production all througout. Album starts off very powerfully with tracks like &quot;Things Done Changed&quot;,&quot;Gimme The Loot&quot; and &quot;Ready to Die&quot; and continues this pace to the very end. Wu-Tangs Method Man drops in for &quot;The What&quot; an amazing collab track where both artists shine. &quot;Juicy&quot; is a track I have probably played more than any other, its that hiphop anthem, where Notorious talks about growing up, the struggles of poverty, violence, and overcoming, while paying tribute to original hiphop. &quot;One more Chance&quot; , &quot;Big Poppa&quot; and Premiers produced &quot;Unbelievable&quot; are just a few more of the amazing tracks found on this album, every one of the Sixteen tracks is memorable on this joint.Biggies lyrics, wordplay and delivery are blazing hot. &quot;Ready to Die&quot; is a classic that should be in every hiphop collection.
