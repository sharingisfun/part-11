It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug &quot;food chain&quot;, from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4rbd4pemb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4rbd4pemb/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ttihvaaf7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ttihvaaf7/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4cyvffryt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4cyvffryt/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy And Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee7dc0eb730413dd1c0cfa2e80b38295c803b5a","amp;dn":"The+Wire+Season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee7dc0eb730413dd1c0cfa2e80b38295c803b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,231,220,14,183,48,65,61,209,192,207,162,232,11,56,41,92,128,59,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
