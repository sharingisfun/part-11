Also included are practice CCRN-style Q&amp;A, test-taking skills, and thorough coverage of the CCRN test blueprint. Written by a well-known CCRN instructor, the review features a &quot;Think in Questions&quot; format, which helps readers to anticipate the kinds of questions that might be asked, and promotes critical thinking throughout the exam.

These questions, in simulated exam format, are answered along with a rationale for each. The review is both comprehensive and user friendly, featuring &quot;bite-size&quot; sections for easier learning and memorization, and plentiful tables and charts.
