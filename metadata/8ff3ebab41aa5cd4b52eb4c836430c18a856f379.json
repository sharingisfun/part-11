Anyone who uses a cell phone becomes insane and violent, attacking anyone around them. Clay must, with the help of survivors Tom and Alice, return to Maine to find out if his wife and young son are among the survivors or the monsters. \n\nPlease seed with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ff3ebab41aa5cd4b52eb4c836430c18a856f379","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Cell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ff3ebab41aa5cd4b52eb4c836430c18a856f379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,243,235,171,65,170,92,212,181,46,180,200,54,67,12,24,168,86,243,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
