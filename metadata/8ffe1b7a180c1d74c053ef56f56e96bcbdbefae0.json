Aided by early proponents\nFrankie Knuckles, Larry Levan and their contemporaries, House became\n the music of choice for the burgeoning clubs scenes of Detroit and\n Chicago, while Disco's days began to look well and truly numbered.\n\n  Fast-forward 20-odd years, and as House enjoys arguably the most\npopular period in its history, the roots of the scene, and the Disco\n on which it was based, are once again being championed by producers\nand DJs alike. In 2014, House and Disco live happily side-by-side: a\n     circumstance that Dimitri From Paris In The House of Disco\n                             celebrates.\n\nWhile, of course, the history and heritage of Disco has to be treated\n   with the respect it undoubtedly deserves, we should perhaps be\nequally as excited by new Disco records, many of which grace this new\ncollection. ÃƒÂ´A fresh generation of artists is finally and unabashedly\n  recording new, sample free, Disco MusicÃƒÂ¶ reports Dimitri ÃƒÂ´and the\n electronic House sound of its origins is making a stylistic return\n   with a sound I would call ÃƒÂ¦neo-vintage': one that embraces the\n   foundation of current Dance Music, celebrating its culture and\n         history and making it contemporary in the process.ÃƒÂ¶\n\n[ SiTES ]\n\nIf you don't know, you probably shouldn't anyway...\n\n[ REGARDS ]\n\n2DB * AAF * AMOK * APC * BPM * DS * EGO * EiTheLMP3 * iDC * JUST\n         KSi * MTC * SND * MiL * MOD * NBD * NmE * NUHS\n                  PULSE * RNS * REV * UTE * WLM\n                   oDDiTy * DeMoN * Razor 1911\n       Superior Art Creations * Chemical Reaction Project\n      ...and all others who make the mp3-scene a better place\n\n[ CONTACT ]\n\nAre you a promoripper/supplier or a DJ?... apply now!\n\nplease contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ccbbadb4a1bcff8ca4b9bfa4e2afa3a1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nNfo Header + Layout by Ferrex of Superior Art Creations\n\nCreated with Nf0 prepare v2.18, by: _Ntr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffe1b7a180c1d74c053ef56f56e96bcbdbefae0","amp;dn":"VA-Defected_Presents_Dimitri_From_Paris_In_The_House_Of_Disco-2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffe1b7a180c1d74c053ef56f56e96bcbdbefae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,254,27,122,24,12,29,116,192,83,239,86,245,110,150,188,189,190,250,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
