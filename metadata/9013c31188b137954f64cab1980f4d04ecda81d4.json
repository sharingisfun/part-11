For those who do not want the large files.\n\nThese were taken from the DFF files that Hal4000 uploaded. Thank you Hal4000.\n\nI think you will be hard pressed to hear any difference between these and the much larger DFF files.\n\nA great sounding collection in less than 1/4 the size.\n\nConverted with J River to wav files. Halved 3 times From the 350 Khz to the 44.1 khz maintaining the 24 bit. Then put into ALAC form. The covers were put through MS Office 2010 picture editor and used auto brightness only.\n\nWav files downsampled using xrecodeII and then encoded to ALAC using xrecodeII.\n\nIf you have his DFF files this is a good comparison.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nPS If you download anything seed it! It is the right thing to do...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9013c31188b137954f64cab1980f4d04ecda81d4","amp;dn":"DEAD+CAN+DANCE+%28Complete%29+MFSL+24-44.1+ALAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9013c31188b137954f64cab1980f4d04ecda81d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,19,195,17,136,177,55,149,79,100,202,177,152,15,77,4,236,218,129,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
