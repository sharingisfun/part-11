Gryner reteams with producer Stuart Brawley, who helmed her second album in 1997, The Original Leap Year. Northern Gospel's title, as Gryner explained in a post on her blog, has less to do with anything associated with organized religion and &quot;...more to do with what I've learned from where I am, geographically, emotionally, etc.&quot; Speaking of &quot;geographically&quot;, I love that Gryner throws the occasional Canadiana reference into her lyrics. Northern Gospel offers three such nods, with references to &quot;Victoria rain&quot; (from &quot;Survive&quot;), Gryner's &quot;Stonetown friends&quot; (from &quot;Last Day On Earth&quot;, a reference to the nickname of St. Mary's, Ontario, where she lives), and name-checking the country itself in &quot;North&quot;. Gryner might not quite surpass The Tragically Hip when it comes to the frequency of paying lyrical homage to their homeland, but it's a small detail that resonates with this Canuck..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:904997181490ab7958ebbdaa9676e2de6e69fc87","amp;dn":"Emm+Gryner+-+Northern+Gospel+%5B2011%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"904997181490ab7958ebbdaa9676e2de6e69fc87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,73,151,24,20,144,171,121,88,235,189,170,150,118,226,222,110,105,252,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
