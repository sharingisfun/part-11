As if that weren't beautiful enough, it is also recorded in various arrangements (harpsichord and string, for one, and a guitar and bandoneon version). All are delightful!\n \nWhat was also a pleasant surprise was the poetry recitals on the CD (these were not actually in the movie). I found myself repeatedly listening to Morning by Sting and to Poetry by Miranda Richardson. Much of the music is accompanied by the beautiful themes of the movie, too. Perhaps the greatest consequence of the CD was that it led me to Neruda's Poetry (love sonnets, odes). The poetry on the disc is just the surface. Did you know Neruda won the Nobel Prize for his beautiful poetry in 1971?\n\nMusically and poetically, this CD is a must-have.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:904ab17cc0e083584df63b3d15a9ac6330fb61d4","amp;dn":"The+Postman+%28Il+Postino%29+Soundtrack+1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"904ab17cc0e083584df63b3d15a9ac6330fb61d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,74,177,124,192,224,131,88,77,246,59,61,21,169,172,99,48,251,97,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
