There&amp;#039;s nothing terribly obscure here ? in fact, most of these were big smashes ? but it&amp;#039;s a good survey of rock&amp;#039;s early days, ranging from superstars like Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and the Beach Boys to great one-shots like the Monotones, the Tempos, and Buster Brown. Drawbacks: Wolfman Jack talks over the intros of a few songs, and there are a couple tracks by early-&amp;#039;70s Sha Na Na-type revivalists Flash Cadillac.
