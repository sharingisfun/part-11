Instead, it culls from his Sue, Veep, and Solid State recordings as well, making it a definitive overview of his career as a gritty, funky singles artist. And, as Greatest Hits demonstrates, McGriff could create a monster groove, making his singles intoxicating slices of funky jazz. All of his R&amp;B hits -- &quot;I've Got a Woman,&quot; &quot;All About My Girl,&quot; &quot;Kiko,&quot; &quot;The Worm&quot; -- are here, as are lesser-known singles and terrific album tracks, resulting in a compilation that isn't just a terrific introduction for neophytes, but also a useful retrospective for collectors.
