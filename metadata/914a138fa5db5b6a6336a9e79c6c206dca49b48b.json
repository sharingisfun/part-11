With a boat and a bike she succeeds to reach a dry spot in the village. There a young man in a car offers her a lift. They drive around in circles, trying to find a way out of the area, but all ways are blocked by the water. Concurrently with the ever rising water the emotions within the two young people also start rising. At last they find their way out of the flooded area.
