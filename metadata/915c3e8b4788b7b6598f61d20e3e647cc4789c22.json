Fink and Klepaski departed Lifer (which was originally called Strangers with Candy) so that they could join forces with singer Ben Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel and form Breaking Benjamin. Why would Fink and Klepaski leave a band that had a contract with Universal to form a new alternative rock band that, at the time, was unsigned? According to Breaking Benjamin's press releases, the ex-members of Lifer had so much faith in Burnley's songwriting talents that they were willing to take a gamble and uproot themselves. So in late 2000, Breaking Benjamin got started with a four-man lineup that consisted of Burnley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Fink on lead guitar, Klepaski on bass, and Hummel on drums. Breaking Benjamin wasn't the first time that Fink had worked with Burnley; he had known the singer since high school. All four members of the band are from Wilkes-Barre, a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania. (Philadelphia and its suburbs are considered southeastern Pennsylvania.) \n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tHpllywood Records\nCatalog:\t\tD001418692\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Polyamorous\n02.Skin\n03.Medicate\n04.So Cold\n05.Sooner Or Later\n06.Rain\n07.The Diary Of Jane\n08.Breath\n09.Until The End\n10.I Will Not Bow\n11.Lights Out\n12.Give Me A Sign\n13.Blow Me Away (Feat.
