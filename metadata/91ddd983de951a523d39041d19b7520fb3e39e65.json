He is the author of The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver through the Anthology (OUP, 1999).\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nThe Definitive Musicological View Of The Beatles\nBy Ian Hammond on November 6, 2001\nWalt Everett's previous volume of THE BEATLES AS MUSICIANS (BAM) dealt with the period from REVOLVER to ABBEY ROAD. Now he completes the story with the &quot;prequel&quot; -- from the QUARRYMEN to RUBBER SOUL.\nThe reason that the project is split into two volumes is simple: to preserve all the detail which is necessary to this ambitious endeavour. It's also a &quot;unique&quot; project: to encompass the complete musicology, instrumentation and recording history of the most influential musical force of the last fourty years.\nEverett speaks with the authority of a musicological professional and the with the unabashed admiration of a listener, providing a cross-over point for those who want to study the Beatles work from both viewpoints.\nI think it's important to note that Everett updates Lewisohn quite significantly. He's used a much broader set of source material (all meticulously referenced), the results of thirty years of study and a musicians ear to make sense of the raw data provided by Lewisohn and others.\nBeyond the invaluable song-by-song treatment, Everett provides a detailed description of their early years and efforts. Like the preceding volume, the book includes many examples and detailed references.\nThe student of the Beatles' music is blessed by a rich literature. These two volumes are among the three or four most important resources for those interested in the musicology, instruments and sessions themselves. The two books are in a class of their own and redefine the standard of rock-pop musicology.\n\n\nDense, but wonderful.\nBy K. L. Uminski on December 10, 2002\nYes, this book is very dense and technical, I am not a musician and was a bit lost at times, however, the author structures the book in such a way that you can skim or skip what is over your head (a lot for me) and still get something out of this book.\nFor me, one of the most important and rare things about this book is the way the author does not fall into the John vs. Paul biases like so many others who have written on this topic. He gives both men the written ananlysis and technical break down of their work they deserve and does not short change Paul in favor of John. This is appreciated as I believe it gives the best description of how the songwriting evolved through the talents of both men.\nHe also gives the same critical analysis of George Harrison's songs, this is rare indeed.\nFor these reasons I highly recommend the book for serious Beatle fans.\nI am already burning through the second book.\n\n\nEssential for serious Beatles fans\nBy Timothy A. Bennett on December 8, 2001\nThis is perhaps the most exhaustive study of Beatles' musicianship ever written. Everett takes the music seriously and examines the development of the Beatles as musicians and composers. To be sure, the book presupposes that the reader be familiar with music theory. Even if you're not (as I am not), the book still offers wonderful insights into the songs and into the Beatles' early history in Liverpool and Hamburg. And I've not found a better book to discuss the recording history and sessions. If you're serious about Beatles' music, buy this book and Everett's volume on the late Beatles (from Revolver to the Anthology) and Mark Lewissohn's Complete Beatles Chronicle and the Anthology volume by the Beatles. But Everett's book is intended for readers seriously interested in the music.\n\n\nExcellent Beatle book but...\nBy James B. Nipe on September 22, 2002\nFirst, let me make it clear that I really like this book (and its companion volume.) It's pretty difficult to write anything about the Beatles anymore that hasn't been written about ad nauseum already, but both of these books contain a great deal of fresh and intelligent information and insight on the Beatles's music. That said, I have a feeling that a lot of folks looking for new Beatles literature just aren't going to particularly enjoy The Beatles As Musicians. I'm a musician, but at times as I was reading this material I felt as though I might as well have been reading Latin simply because Mr. Everett is often very technical and rather esoteric in his discussions. In some ways (and Mr. Everett admittedly touches on this issue) these books seem somehow to fly in the face of what makes rock music so great in the first place...emotion, borderline chaos, an underlying sense of danger and rebellion, limited musicianship that somehow leads to innovation, chance, improvisation, etc etc. Still, as I noted, I enjoyed these books a great deal even when I didn't have the slightest idea what the author was writing about. But if you're not a musician or you are one who is largely self-taught and as technically stupid as I am, I wonder how much you'll like The Beatles As Musicians. Regardless, in appreciation of the freshness and intelligence of his work, I have to give Mr. Everett's books both five stars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ddd983de951a523d39041d19b7520fb3e39e65","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+As+Musicians+The+Quarry+Men+through+Rubber+Soul%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ddd983de951a523d39041d19b7520fb3e39e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,221,217,131,222,149,26,82,61,57,4,29,25,183,82,15,179,227,158,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
