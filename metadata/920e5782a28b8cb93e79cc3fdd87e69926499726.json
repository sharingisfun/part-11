It's just Dylan, guitar, and harmonica here, but Another Side is a rock &amp; roll album without that band.\n&lt;p&gt;\nNote: This is an mp4 encode of the new &quot;reissue&quot; version of Another Side Of Bob Dylan: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically. \n&lt;/p&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:920e5782a28b8cb93e79cc3fdd87e69926499726","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Another+Side+Of+Bob+Dylan+%28Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"920e5782a28b8cb93e79cc3fdd87e69926499726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,14,87,130,162,139,140,185,62,121,204,63,221,135,230,153,38,73,151,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
