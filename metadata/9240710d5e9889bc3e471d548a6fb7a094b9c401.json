As the only female detective in the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most elite police unit, she has to fight for every ounce of respect, especially from her new boss. While she wants to track down a rumored cocaine shipment, he gives her the least promising case possible. But the caseÃ¢â‚¬â€the attempted theft of an old samurai swordÃ¢â‚¬â€proves more dangerous than anyone on the force could have imagined.\n\nThe owner of the sword, Professor Yasuo Yamada, says it was crafted by the legendary Master Inazuma, a sword smith whose blades are rumored to have magical qualities. The man trying to steal it already owns another InazumaÃ¢â‚¬â€one whose deadly power eventually comes to control all who wield it. Or so says Yamada, and though he has studied swords and swordsmanship all his life, Mariko isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t convinced.\n\nBut MarikoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skepticism hardly matters. Her investigation has put her on a collision course with a curse centuries old and as bloodthirsty as ever. She is only the latest in a long line of warriors and soldiers to confront this power, and even the sword she learns to wield could turn against her.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9240710d5e9889bc3e471d548a6fb7a094b9c401","amp;dn":"Daughter+of+the+Sword+by+Steve+Bein+%28Fated+Blades+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9240710d5e9889bc3e471d548a6fb7a094b9c401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,64,113,13,94,152,137,188,62,71,29,84,138,111,183,160,148,185,196,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
