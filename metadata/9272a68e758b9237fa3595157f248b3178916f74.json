The song became that album&amp;#039;s second number one R&amp;B \nsingle and its third top ten pop single, hitting number six on the Billboard \nHot 100. \n \nSong information \n \nThe song, written by Jackson and Teddy Riley, is about keeping a relationship \nbetween secret lovers. The video, directed by Herb Ritts, features Jackson \ndancing suggestively with model Naomi Campbell. The song&amp;#039;s female vocal was \noriginally labeled &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; but was later revealed to be Princess \nSt phanie of Monaco, though the vocal was originally meant for Madonna. \n \nThe song, with its heavy industrial sounding percussion and uptempo arrangement, \nis typical of producer Teddy Riley&amp;#039;s New Jack Swing style. The unique, \nEastern-influenced backing vocals, sexually-charged lyrics, and crescendoing \nmiddle eight imbue the song with an erotic edge usually missing from Jackson&amp;#039;s \nmusic. His vocals are whispered and subdued for most of the song, embellished \nwith gasps and shudders. Only in the chorus is his typically soulful falsetto \ngiven free reign. \n \nIn keeping with the trend in the early 1990s, several remixes were commissioned by Jackson and released on a maxi-CD. The most prolific of these remixes was &quot;The Promise&quot; remix by UK DJ Frankie Knuckles, which made its way into the club circuit. \n \nVideo Clip \n--- File Information --- \nZrodlo-Source: DVD \nNazwa pliku - File Name: Michael Jackson - In The Closet [SyNtEr].avi \nWielkosc pliku- File Size (in bytes): 83,852,922 \n--- Container Information --- \nTyp pliku - Base Type: AVI(.AVI), Subtype: OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps): 0 \nInterleave (in ms): 40, Preload (in ms): 32 \nNumber of Audio Streams: 1 \nAudio: 19.9 MB (24.92%) \nVideo: 59.6 MB (74.54%) \n--- Video Information --- \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;): H264, Video Codec Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nCzas - Duration (hh:mm:ss): 6:13.000 \nKlatki - Frame Count: 9325 \nObraz Szer x Wys - Size (pixels): 624 x 480 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;: 1.300 \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;): 1.000 \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;): 1.300 \nFrames Per Second: 25.000 \nPics Per Second: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1340 \nKodowanie - Type(&quot;MPEG-4/B-VOP/QPel/GMC/NVOP/H264): ///// \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.179&quot; \n--- Audio Information --- \nAudio: Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3, Audio alignment: Split \nAudio: Sample Rate (Hz): 48000, Bitrate(kbps): 448, Bitrate Type: CBR, Channel Count: 6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9272a68e758b9237fa3595157f248b3178916f74","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+In+The+Closet+%5BDVDRip-SyNtEr%5D+%5BAC3%5D+%5BH264%5D+%5BSu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9272a68e758b9237fa3595157f248b3178916f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,114,166,142,117,139,146,55,250,53,149,21,127,36,139,49,120,145,111,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
