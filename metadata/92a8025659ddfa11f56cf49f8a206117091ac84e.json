In Impossibility, astronomer John D. Barrow outlines a maturation pattern for areas of deep human inquiry that includes an adolescence of exciting discoveries, new formulas, and unusual predictions. As science has matured, our confidence in it has grown. We expect that science has answers, that its predictive powers are mostly accurate. But what happens when the science gets old? Oddly enough, it seems to have started trying to find the end of its own usefulness--its formulas &quot;predict that there are things which they cannot predict, observations which cannot be made, statements whose truth they can neither affirm nor deny.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a8025659ddfa11f56cf49f8a206117091ac84e","amp;dn":"Impossibility+%3A+The+Limits+of+Science+and+the+Science+of+Limits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a8025659ddfa11f56cf49f8a206117091ac84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,168,2,86,89,221,250,17,245,108,244,159,138,32,97,23,9,26,200,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
