Haden's &quot;Chairman Mao&quot; is a complex number, as Haden opens with an intense repetitious vamp before Zeitlin enters with the delicate Oriental-flavored theme, which sets up Haden's intricate bass solo. The duo has lots of fun with Ornette Coleman's topsy-turvy blues &quot;Bird Food&quot; before reverting to a lovely standard ballad, &quot;As Long As There's Music,&quot; with an added emphasis on its lyricism. Zeitlin's intriguing &quot;Time Remembers One Time Once&quot; starts as a waltz but its sudden turns defy prediction. Their laid-back approach to &quot;Love for Sale&quot; is refreshing, especially when compared to the typically up-tempo arrangements heard all too often. A medley of John Coltrane's &quot;Satellite&quot; and the old warhorse &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (with Haden coyly interpolating Charlie Parker's &quot;Ornithology,&quot; which is based upon &quot;How High the Moon&quot;) also works beautifully. The occasional over-modulation in this recording doesn't detract from the outstanding performances and this CD should be essential for fans of either Denny Zeitlin and/or Charlie Haden.
