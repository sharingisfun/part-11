The introduction explains the basic theory of RF power amplifiers besides providing the basic classification of the different types of RF power amplifier. It then systematically dedicates a chapter to each different of RF power amplifier covering A, B and C, D (full-bridge and half-bridge types), E (zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching), F and DE amplifiers. Throughout this comprehensive guide, the optimal operating conditions are explored and the possible causes for suboptimum operation explained. The book then considers integrated inductors and linearization techniques and LC Oscillators in the concluding chapters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92ec3f3847ff0498b3188765b7c2bd559d3c3df4","amp;dn":"RF+Power+Amplifiers+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92ec3f3847ff0498b3188765b7c2bd559d3c3df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,236,63,56,71,255,4,152,179,24,135,101,183,194,189,85,157,60,61,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
