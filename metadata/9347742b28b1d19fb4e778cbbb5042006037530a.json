The film that brought AlmodÃƒÂ³var to widespread international attention, it was nominated for the 1989 Academy Award for Best Foreign-language film, and won five Goya Awards including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. The actual title refers in Spanish to &quot;un ataque de nervios&quot; which is not actually well translated by &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. &quot;Ataques de nervios&quot; are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. \n\nRip Specs \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Women.on.the.Verge.of.a.Nervous.Breakdown.1988.720p.BluRay.x264.HDCLUB.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 5.18 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 28mn\n      Overall bit rate : 8 401 Kbps\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Bit rate : 7 593 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 692 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.850\n      Frame rate : 24.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 640 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Language : Spanish\n   Text #3\n      ID : 3\n      Format : UTF-8\n      Codec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\n      Codec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\n      Language : Romanian\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095675/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095675/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Spanish\nSubtitles: Romanian (muxed in mkv), English, Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted at KG by Ursuletz, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9347742b28b1d19fb4e778cbbb5042006037530a","amp;dn":"Women.on.the.Verge.of.a.Nervous.Breakdown.1988.720p.BluRay.x264.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9347742b28b1d19fb4e778cbbb5042006037530a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,71,116,43,40,177,209,159,180,231,120,203,187,80,66,0,96,55,83,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
