She has been experiencing reoccurring nightmares about the Witchblade calling out to her. This is due to the secret that the temple houses within, the Witchblade sealed inside a box. Furthermore, her lineage keeps an unknown connection with the mystic artifact and the folklore of the Oni, hence explaining Takeru's strong attraction to the gauntlet which is locally called Oni no te (Ã©Â¬Â¼Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¦â€°â€¹, &quot;Hand of Oni&quot;). Ultimately, Takeru's life suffers a drastic change when she becomes the next bearer of the Witchblade due to some circumstances that force her to randomly encounter it.\n\nWitchblade Takeru started serial run since March 2006 in Champion Red magazine under publisher Akita Shoten. Story by Kobayashi Yasuko with art made by Sumita Kazasa, whose art and illustrations carry over an erotic style.\n\nJapanese title: Ã£â€šÂ¦Ã£â€šÂ£Ã£Æ’Æ’Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’Â¬Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’â€°\nType: Manga\nVolumes: 2\nChapters: 12\nStatus: Finished\nPublished: Not available\nGenres: Action, Ecchi, Horror, School, Sci-Fi, Super Power\nAuthors: Kobayashi, Yasuko (Story), Sumita, Kazasa (Art)\nSerialization: None\nFormat: PDF\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: BakaBT\nScanlating Groups: DCP, Whitewolf, Deckard, The Minutemen\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4285&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4285&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=1899&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=1899&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/manga/3489/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myanimelist.net/manga/3489/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9349fd185e72b0644bfa63b9e246bf587f9c8e16","amp;dn":"%5BManga+Motome%5D+Witchblade+%282006%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9349fd185e72b0644bfa63b9e246bf587f9c8e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,73,253,24,94,114,176,100,75,250,99,185,226,70,191,88,127,156,142,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
