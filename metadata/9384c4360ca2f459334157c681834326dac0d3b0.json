Youâ€™ll need your wits to find them all.\r\n\r\nCombat bizarre biomechanoid constructs, the deadly fallout of an ancient war, and the demons of your own psyche.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, break the game itself by using glitches to corrupt foes and solve puzzles in the environment.\r\n\r\nLife. Afterlife. Real. Virtual. Dream. Nightmare. It's a thin line.\r\n\r\nIt's Axiom Verge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9384c4360ca2f459334157c681834326dac0d3b0","amp;dn":"Axiom+Verge+v1.21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9384c4360ca2f459334157c681834326dac0d3b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,132,196,54,12,162,244,89,51,65,87,198,129,131,67,38,218,192,211,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
