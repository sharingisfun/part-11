The album was Springsteen's eleventh #1 album placing him third all-time for most #1 albums only behind Jay-Z and The Beatles.[2]\n\n The album features Springsteen's regular backing band, the E Street Band, and guitarist Tom Morello. Contributions from deceased E Street Band members, Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, are also included. Co-produced by Ron Aniello, Brendan O'Brien and Bruce Springsteen, the album was preceded by the single, &quot;High Hopes&quot;, and is a collection of cover songs, out-takes and re-imagined versions of tracks from past albums, EPs and tours. A week following the album's release, a music video for &quot;Just Like Fire Would&quot; was released.\n\n Springsteen said that the new music was &quot;some of our best unreleased material from the past decade&quot; and among the best of his writing and deserved a proper studio recording.After download please SEED:-)\n MANY THANKS ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9388d988a464f4deb144e8d345b81ac3a0718559","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+High+Hopes+%282014%29+mp3+Zaankanter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9388d988a464f4deb144e8d345b81ac3a0718559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,136,217,136,164,100,244,222,177,68,232,211,69,184,26,195,160,113,133,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
