In it he satirizes the fads and fashions of the time. It is the witty story of a house party at Ã¢â‚¬ËœCromeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ where there is a gathering of bright young things. We hear some of the history of the house from Henry Wimbush, its owner and self appointed historian; Apocylapse is prophesied, virginity is lost, and inspirational aphorisms are gained in a trance. Our hero, Denis, tries to capture it all in poetry and is disappointed in love.\n\nThe author, Aldous Huxley, was born in 1894 and began writing poetry and short stories in his early twenties; this was his first novel and established his literary reputation.\n\nFrom: BitTorrentScene {BTScene]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938facda8182f1dd57848e0604243e13b2537c61","amp;dn":"Crome+Yellow+by+Aldous+Huxley+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938facda8182f1dd57848e0604243e13b2537c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,143,172,218,129,130,241,221,87,132,142,6,4,36,62,19,178,83,124,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
