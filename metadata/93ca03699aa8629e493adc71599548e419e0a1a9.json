Actually the music (which features pianist Lou Levy, bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Victor Lewis in addition to the leader's tenor) is the equal of the original set, with &quot;How About You,&quot; &quot;Easy Living,&quot; and &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot; showing off Getz's tone and strong improvising skills at its best. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. How About You\n02. You're Blaze\n03. Easy Living\n04. Sweet Lorraine\n05. Old Devil Moon\n06. I'm Old Fashioned\n07. Spring Is Here\n\nPersonnel:\nStan Getz - tenor saxophone\nLou Levy - piano\nMonty Budwig - bass\nVictor Lewis - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
