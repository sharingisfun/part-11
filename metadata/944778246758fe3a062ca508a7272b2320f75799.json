Humanity has begun to colonise new worlds and until now, they were aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n\nIn Halfway you take control of a small team of survivors faced with a violent invasion onboard the colonial vessel Goliath. As their leader you will guide them through the dark and cramped corridors of the ship to slowly take back control.\n\n\n\nIf you have any hope of surviving, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to fight, face your fears and outsmart the enemy! \n\nKey features\n\n    Tactical turn-based battles are at the core of Halfway. Use cover, position, equipment and skills to your advantage in your battles.\n\n    Unique characters: Your team is formed of unique characters you pick up along the way. Each one of them brings their own story, skills and experiences to the journey.\n\n    Find yourself in the middle of an engrossing story-line. Step by step youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll uncover the mysterious events that took place and what it means for you and all of humanity.\n\n    Immerse yourself in 10-14 hours of gameplay in a beautiful pixel art environment with a lovely atmospheric soundtrack by Gavin Harrison\n\n    Mod support coming soon!
