During their battle, Farooq zaps The Flash and siphons all his electricity, leaving The Flash without his speed. Dr. Wells, Caitlin and Cisco work to reverse the effects on Barry, but their efforts are disrupted when Farooq comes banging on S.T.A.R. Labs doors in search of Wells, who he blames for his accident. Without Barry's powers to protect them, the group must figure out a way to save themselves from the metahuman. Meanwhile, Tockman manages a coup inside the Central City police department and takes several people hostage, including Joe and Iris. While Iris is sure The Flash will save them, Eddie has a trick up his sleeve. \n\nÃ‚Â \n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3922506/?ref_=ttep_ep_cur&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;\nRatings: 9.0/10 from 172 users   \n\nÃ‚Â \n&lt;blockquote&gt;Encoding Information\nGeneral           : The.Flash.2014.S01E07.720p.WEB-DL.ReEnc.QAAC.x264-xRed\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 200 Kbps\nLength            : 365 MiB for 42mn 34s 197ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 960 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 718 (1.783) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 232 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947cc4374992f5be1ad78d6d9bae4248d452f48e","amp;dn":"The+Flash+2014+S01E07+720p+WEB-DL+ReEnc+QAAC+x264-xRed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947cc4374992f5be1ad78d6d9bae4248d452f48e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,124,196,55,73,146,245,190,26,215,141,109,155,174,66,72,212,82,244,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
