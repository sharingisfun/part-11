Behind The Sun   6 \n\n\nthere's a moving saxophone solo at the end of a song trilogy written and produced by bassist Jett Beres. The CD's finale, &quot;Love, Hope and Faith&quot; consists of three songs dedicated to three women Beres adores ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his wife (&quot;The Road&quot;), his daughter (&quot;Snow Globe World&quot;) and his late mother (&quot;Meet Me Behind the Sun&quot;).\n\nBeres said he worked through the trilogy as the songs appear on the disc, starting with &quot;The Road,&quot; a nod to a long relationship that has endured the ups and downs of a traveling musician. &quot;That's when the whole thing took shape conceptually ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the road of life,&quot; Beres said.\n\nThe road is a common theme on the new disc from a platinum-selling band that has been together ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the same line-up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for 16 years. Most are family men with little Hazels running about, so touring is not as relentless as it once was. But relentless is a relative term; the quintet still tours hard, and now they often bring their kids along for the ride.\n\n&quot;I think our lives have been defined, in one dimension, as being gypsies,&quot; said lead singer Ken Block. &quot;We've been at this a long time now. We've spent an awful lot of time bouncing from state to state. I can be in my bunk and tell you when we cross a state line by the different hum of the highway.&quot;\n\n&quot;Heartland Highway&quot; tips its hat to the great catalogue of endorphin-sparking road songs. Think the Allman's Brother's instrumental &quot;Jessica&quot; or REM's frantic caffeine classic &quot;It's the End of the World As We Know It.&quot;\n\n&quot;Those are the records I've always loved when I was growing up, the ones you can put on and they're going to take you for a ride as you're taking a ride,&quot; Block added.\n\nSister Hazel created &quot;Heartland Highway&quot; the way it created 2009's retail and online success &quot;Release&quot; and 2007's &quot;Santa's Playlist.&quot; The band used songs from all five members. But they took that one step further for &quot;Heartland Highway.&quot;\n\nThe songwriters produced their respective tracks and guided their development.\n\n&quot;This time, whoever brought in the song would be the person we would defer to,&quot; said lead guitarist Ryan Newell. &quot;We've been a band for so long that we know each other's strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately we end up being the best producers for this band.&quot;\n\n&quot;It all tracks back to our holiday record,&quot; added guitarist and singer Drew Copeland. &quot;Then we did it on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Release,' and that went well. We just keep making little tweaks here and there to change the process, to make it better and better each time.&quot;\n\nThe new disc also has Southern rock edges and some longer, anthemic tracks.\n\n&quot;I definitely think we've covered some ground Sister Hazel has never covered before,&quot; Newell said. &quot;We certainly weren't afraid to take chances on this record. There's everything from country-sounding music to what we normally do to Beatle-esque songs.\n\nStill, the band contends the Hazel sound remains. Present are the acoustic-tinged familiar elements that still attract loyal Hazelnuts of many ages who follow this band from venue to venue, year after year.\n\n&quot;I don't think there was a point that we wanted to change the sound of the band, but this (CD) was a way to bring a fresh approach to the music than just going off in a different direction or chasing something else,&quot; said drummer Mark Trojanowski.\n\nIn the end, noted Block, &quot;the sound of the five of us behind our instruments sounds like Sister Hazel.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94903656533023b9f494e5ed788134859637778a","amp;dn":"Sister+Hazel...Heartland+Highway%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94903656533023b9f494e5ed788134859637778a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,144,54,86,83,48,35,185,244,148,229,237,120,129,52,133,150,55,119,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
