She received praise throughout the competition, and although she was the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on the 31 May. During the competition, she received singing lessons from Yvie Burnett and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she rejected offers of contracts from Sony BMG, although she did appear on fellow finalist Andrew Johnston's debut album One Voice.\n\nSmith signed a contract with Universal Classics and Jazz for a ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£2.3 million advance in December 2008, the largest ever granted to a schoolgirl. Her debut album, Faryl, was recorded in December 2008 and January 2009, and was released in March 2009. Faryl became the fastest selling solo classical album in British chart history, selling 29,200 copies in the first week. It debuted at number 6, but rose to number 4 in the following week, making Smith the third Britain's Got Talent contestant to have a top ten album. Her second album, Wonderland, was released in November 2009. Smith lives with her parents in Kettering, where she attends Southfield School for Girls.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nFaryl (vbr mp3)\n1. \t&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;   \tTraditional \t4:04\n2. \t&quot;The River of Light&quot;   \tBased on &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, by Johann Strauss II \t3:44\n3. \t&quot;Ave Maria&quot;   \tCharles Gounod/J.
