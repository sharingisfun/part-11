Author Carlos Oliveira begins from the basic building blocks of the language. He shows how to create correct and efficient applications by applying your knowledge of object-oriented and structured programming. This book:\n\nTakes you quickly through fundamental concepts such as interfaces and class implementations.\nProvides a concise reference to the Foundation Framework that is all-important when programming in Objective-C.\nHighlights key differences between Objective-C and other popular languages such as Java or Python.\nProvides the fundamentals of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, which are the standard for OS X and iOS development.\n\nObjective-C Programmer's Reference makes extensive use of concepts already mastered by developers who are fluent in other languages such as C++, Java, Perl, and Python. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach is logical and structured, and even novice developers will have an easy time absorbing the most important topics necessary to program in Objective-C.\n\nObjective-C Programmer's Reference is a book for professional developers in Objective-C, or those who are moving to Objective-C from other languages. The book is written for readers who lack the time to invest in more traditional books, which usually spend hundreds of pages to explain concepts that are part of the working programmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard vocabulary.\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\n\nGrasp the basic syntax of the Objective-C language.\n\nCreate classes and methods in Objective-C.\n\nApply Objective-CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message-passing mechanism to simplify your code and avoid deep class hierarchies.\n\nStore and access dynamic data through Objective-CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built-in, key-value system.\n\nMake effective use of container classes such as arrays and dictionaries with their immutable and mutable versions.\n\nCreate simple applications for iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, and other iOS and Mac OS X devices.\n\n\nWho this book is for\nObjective-C Programmer's Reference is for programmers in Objective-C who are looking for a handy reference to keep them on top of their game. The book is also designed for programmers moving to Objective-C from some other language, especially from another C-like language such as Java or C#, providing just that additional bit that is needed to transfer their expertise into Objective-C and get a leg up on creating applications for the iOS and OS X platforms underlying AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hugely successful devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and Macbook.\n\nAbout the Author\nCarlos Oliveirais a professional developer who works in the financial industry. Carlos has more than 10 years of experience on the Objective-C and C++ languages, having developed several large scale applications for companies big and small.\n\nCarlos Oliveira obtained a PhD in Systems Engineering and Operations Research from the University of Florida, a Masters in Computer Science from UFC (Brazil), and a BSc in Computer Science from UECE (Brazil). In the past, Carlos has performed academic research on combinatorial optimization, with applications in areas such as telecommunications, computational biology, and logistics. He has written more than 20 papers on optimization aspects of these topics, and has worked as assistant professor at Oklahoma State University from 2004 to 2006.\n\nCarlos Oliveira currently works in New York City and lives in New Jersey with his wife and son.
