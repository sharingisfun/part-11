Though both Tracy Thorn and Ben Watt learned how to use their voices to better effect over the years, their vocal talents are evident here. Singing over a gentle, tropical-toned combo, Thorn sounds strong and free, and, when the occasion calls for it, vulnerable. Watt may be a little melodramatic on &quot;Tender Blue,&quot; but the affecting &quot;Soft Touch&quot; more than makes up for it. Meanwhile, &quot;Another Bridge&quot; presages &quot;Me and Bobby D&quot; (from The Language of Life); &quot;The Dustbowl&quot; succinctly captures a post-breakup reflection with only a modicum of regret; &quot;Frost and Fire&quot; reaches out from daughter to mother; and &quot;I Must Confess&quot; neatly sambas its way out of a finished relationship. Mature, intelligent, and unflinchingly romantic, it ranks among EBTG&amp;#039;s best work. --Randy Silver\n\nProduct Description\n\n1984 Debut Disc by England&amp;#039;s Dance/Pop Pairing, Everything but the Girl (Featuring Tracy Thorn and Ben Watt).
