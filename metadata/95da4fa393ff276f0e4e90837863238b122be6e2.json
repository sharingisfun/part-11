It also marks the first appearance of many progressive rock elements which would be used frequently in later albums, seen in the length and odd time signatures of the title track &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,&quot; and by the fact that it is a concept album.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Moonchild&quot;   \t \t        5:40\n2. \t&quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;   \t \t6:08\n3. \t&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;   \t3:31\n4. \t&quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;   \t4:33\n5. \t&quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; \t9:53\n6. \t&quot;The Prophecy&quot;   \t\t5:05\n7. \t&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;   \t \t4:27\n8. \t&quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;   \t4:40\n\nTotal length:                           43:57\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95da4fa393ff276f0e4e90837863238b122be6e2","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%281988%29+Seventh+Son+Of+A+Seventh+Son%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95da4fa393ff276f0e4e90837863238b122be6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,218,79,163,147,255,39,111,14,78,144,131,120,99,35,139,18,43,230,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
