As the times changed, so did the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound. They slowly peeled away the arena rock guitars of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s, occasionally scoring on the adult contemporary charts and sometimes singing country music without ever rejecting hard rock, a move that illustrated how they never abandoned their roots and became second only to Bruce Springsteen in defining the sound and spirit of New Jersey rock &amp; roll.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Runaway\n02.She Don't Know Me\n03.In And Out Of Love\n04.Livin' On A Prayer\n05.Wanted Dead Or Alive\n06.You Give Love A Bad Name\n07.Never Say Goodbye\n08.Bad Medicine\n09.Born To Be My Baby\n10.I'll Be There For You\n11.Lay Your Hands On Me\n12.Keep The Faith\n13.Bed Of Roses\n14.I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\n15.In These Arms\n16.Blaze Of Glory\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Always\n02.Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\n03.Something For The Pain\n04.This Ain't A Love Song\n05.Queen Of New Orleans\n06.It's My Life\n07.Thank You For Loving Me\n08.One Wild Night\n09.Everyday\n10.Misunderstood\n11.All About Lovin' You\n12.Have A Nice Day\n13.Who Says You Can't Go Home\n14.Welcome To Wherever You Are\n15.Lost Highway\n16.(You Want To) Make A Memory\n17.Whole Lot Of Leavin'\n18.Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore (Feat.
