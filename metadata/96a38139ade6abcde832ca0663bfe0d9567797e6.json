Watch German tanks thunder across Poland during the infamous blitzkrieg; sit in the cockpit of Luftwaffe and RAF aircraft; experience the monumental sea battles in the South Pacific; share in the heroic efforts of resistance fighters across Europe; relive the bloody storming of the Normandy beaches on D-Day...and much more. Here are the political giants - Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill - captured both in public and in private. Here too are the mythic military men such as Eisenhower, Patton, MacArthur, Tojo, Montgomery, and Rommel. Perhaps most gripping of all are the photographs of anonymous soldiers in the field and innocent civilian victims trapped in the path of a brutal war. With its concise text and captions, and numerous line drawings and maps that document the tactics, strategies, and goals of both the Axis and the Allies, this is a book for anyone interested in the evolution of war, the power of photography, and the course of history in our age.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPrelude 13\r\n1939 - The Crime of War 23\r\n1939 â€” The Picture Story 33\r\n1940 - Lone BritannÃ­a 41\r\n1940 â€” The Picture Story 59\r\n1941 â€” A World at War 75\r\n1941 â€” The Picture Story 95\r\n1942 â€” Year of Struggle and Peril 113\r\n1942 - The Picture Story 145\r\n1943 - Deeds of Carnage 167\r\n1943 - The Picture Story 191\r\n1944 â€” To Free a Suffering Humanity 207\r\n1944 â€” The Picture Story 231\r\n1945 - Watch this Victory... 255\r\n1945 â€” The Picture Story 281\r\nIndex 303  \r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/7h4m25g11/A_Pictorial_History_of_the_World_War_II_Years.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96a38139ade6abcde832ca0663bfe0d9567797e6","amp;dn":"A+Pictorial+History+of+the+World+War+II+Years+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96a38139ade6abcde832ca0663bfe0d9567797e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,163,129,57,173,230,171,205,232,50,202,6,99,191,224,217,86,119,151,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
