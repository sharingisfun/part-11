The novelistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homes and the locations that are prominently featured in his controversial works are the focus of this pictorial travel guide, and include the ancient town of Rouen, where Flaubert was born in 1821; the resort town of Trouville and its frequently painted beach; Croisset, where FlaubertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riverside house gave him the refuge to write; and the quiet country town of Ry, which claims to be where the real Madame Bovary lived and died.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970d228c5c4b9b3dd3c3c075336229927b7895c5","amp;dn":"A+Journey+into+Flaubert%27s+Normandy+%28ArtPlace+series%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970d228c5c4b9b3dd3c3c075336229927b7895c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,13,34,140,92,75,155,61,211,195,192,117,51,98,41,146,123,120,149,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
