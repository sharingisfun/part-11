They are a monument to his vision and determination, but these alone are not enough. An appreciation of the mathematical theories underlying bridge design is essential to resist the physical forces of nature and gravity.\n\nThe object of this book is to explain firstly the nature of the problems associated with the building of bridges with steel as the basic material, and then the theories that are available to tackle them.\n\na technological history of the different types of iron and steel bridges\nthe basic properties of steel\nloads on bridges from either natural or traffic-induced forces\nthe process and aims of design based on limit state and statistical probability concepts\nbuckling behaviour of various components and large-deflection behaviour of components with initial imperfections\ndetailed guidance on the design of plate and box girder bridges together with some design examples\n\nThe Second Edition includes a completely new chapter on the history and design of cable-stayed bridges, the various types of cable used for them and their method of construction, and it addresses many of the changes introduced in the latest version of the British Standard Design Code for steel bridges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97231874e3b711f03463d3cbaec4fea09cf71000","amp;dn":"The+Design+of+Modern+Steel+Bridges+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97231874e3b711f03463d3cbaec4fea09cf71000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,35,24,116,227,183,17,240,52,99,211,203,174,196,254,160,156,247,16,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
