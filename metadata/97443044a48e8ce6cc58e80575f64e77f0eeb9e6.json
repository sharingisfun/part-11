He called it 'The Fuhrer Territory'.\r\nIn this 10 sq. kilometre area, surrounded by SS and Gestapo guards with orders to kill on sight, luxury homes were built for the Fuhrer and his Nazi Elite. There were guest houses, a hotel, a farm, a cinema, a nursery, an underground communications centre and giant bunkers for the military high command and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\nAnd above it all loomed THE EAGLE'S NEST, a mountaintop fortress 6,000 feet up on the top of a sheer mountain peak, which could only be reached by a deep tunnel and a secret elevator shaft.\r\nHere, in the mountains Hitler made his most important decisions and his monstrous plans for the slaughter of millions and the subjugation of Europe. Here, he received Kings and heads of state and diplomats, many of whose countries would fall into his clutches. This was the place where he kept his jealously guarded mistress, Eva Braun and here many other Nazi leaders chose to live and raise their families.\r\nTHE EAGLE'S NEST is a unique insight into Hitler's sercret power base and the rise and fall of the Nazi party. Using extensive home movie footage, much of it in colour, the film captures the lives and changing fortunes of Hitler and his most trusted inner circle in a way that the public were never allowed to see them.\r\nHere they are captured relaxing. Hitler plays with his dog, dances and poses for the cameras. Hermann Goering commissions a film chronicling a day in the life of his child, Eva Braun films the Nazi leaders and their families enjoying themselves around her and attends to her sister's wedding.\r\nThis chilling insight into the heart of Hitler's private world also includes rare film of his rise to power and uses extensive combat footage to show the outcome of the fateful decisions he made in the seclusion of his secret retreat.\r\nThis 1987 four-hour documentary was produced for Dutch television and is based on the book &quot;Het Adelaarsnest : Hitlers Verborgen Machtscentrum&quot; by H. van Capelle and A.P. van de Bovenkamp published in 1985.\r\n\r\nProduced by Dr. Pieter van de Bovenkamp, Dr. Henk van Capelle and Willem Herselman.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/57/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/57/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/The-Eagles-Nest-Inside-Hitlers-Secret-Retreat-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 027 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 704x544\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000 fps\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 35mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nPart Size: 1.50 GB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Eagles_Nest:_Inside_Hitlers_Secret_Retreat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97443044a48e8ce6cc58e80575f64e77f0eeb9e6","amp;dn":"The+Eagles+Nest+Inside+Hitlers+Secret+Retreat+2of2+x264+AC3+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97443044a48e8ce6cc58e80575f64e77f0eeb9e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,68,48,68,164,142,140,230,204,88,232,5,117,246,78,119,240,238,185,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
