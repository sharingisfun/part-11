Nicholson is saved from hanging by the intervention of a lovely young woman who agrees to marry and take charge of him. Mary Steenburgen plays Julia Tate, the headstrong but genteel Southern virgin who weds Nicholson only to help her work the gold mine she insists is on her property. Both Steenburgen and John Belushi made their film debuts in this amusing western.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981fa363e231246c17b45329767d6c7cfd4e4d82","amp;dn":"Goin%5C%27+South","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981fa363e231246c17b45329767d6c7cfd4e4d82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,31,163,99,226,49,36,108,23,180,83,41,118,125,108,124,253,78,77,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
