Labeled as their big comeback album, My Brain Hurts has a poppier, more mature sound rather than the teen angst-ridden thrash-pop these guys were known for on their previous two records. And with their best-known songs here -- like &quot;Guest List,&quot; &quot;Kamala's Too Nice,&quot; and their &quot;I Can See Clearly&quot; cover -- My Brain Hurts was the album that would eventually define the Screeching Weasel sound for the remainder of their careers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98474693097dbc49ece6da2458caf119f5a06471","amp;dn":"Screeching+Weasel+-+My+Brain+Hurts+%282005%29+%28Remaster%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98474693097dbc49ece6da2458caf119f5a06471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,71,70,147,9,125,188,73,236,230,218,36,88,202,241,25,245,160,100,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
