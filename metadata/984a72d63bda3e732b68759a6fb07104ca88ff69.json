The band is composed of founder, frontman and songwriter Sully Erna, guitarist Tony Rombola, bassist Robbie Merrill, and drummer Shannon Larkin. Since its formation, Godsmack has released five studio albums, one EP (The Other Side), four DVDs, one compilation album (Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack), and one live album (Live and Inspired).\n\nThe band has had three consecutive number-one albums (Faceless, IV, and The Oracle) on the Billboard 200. The band also has 20 top ten rock radio hits, including 15 songs in the top five, a record number of top ten singles by a rock artist.\nSince its inception, Godsmack has toured on Ozzfest on more than one occasion, and has toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. Godsmack has sold over 20 million records in just over a decade, yet despite the decline of album sales in recent years, they have proven to be one of the highest-grossing artists in the United States.\n1000hp (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nIn February 2014, Erna tweeted that the band has made progress in the songwriting process for its next studio album, tentatively scheduled for late 2014 release. He also mentioned that the band finished 11 songs for the new record in two weeks. In April, the band announced that they have recorded 15 songs, ten of which will make the final cut. In May, Erna announced that the album is titled 1000hp (1000 Horsepower). The album's title track was released as a single the following month. The album will be released on August 5, 2014.\nInfluences and style\nSully Erna playing a drum solo.\n\nThe band's primary influences include Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Pantera, and Rush according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola. Erna has cited Layne Staley as his primary influence. The overall sound of the band's first two albums sound similar to the sound of the Alice in Chains album Dirt. More recently, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, &quot;I've just never really heard that in our music&quot;. On their more industrial songs Godsmack seems to have taken an influence from White Zombie, also covering their song &quot;Thunder Kiss '65&quot;.\n\nThe band's music is often compared to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence. Adrien Begrand of Popmatters states, &quot;Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley's low, guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls&quot; -Erna's vocals also seem to be reminiscent of Metallica's James Hetfield- and, &quot;The band's music is a faithful retread of Jerry Cantrell's churning, tuned-down hard rock&quot;. Katherine Turman ofstates the band has &quot;dark, swirling, commanding music&quot;. She also commented on the band's third album Faceless, which &quot;mixes arena rock in the vein of an Alice in Chains&quot;, &quot;riff-heavy, layered tunes and sharp, confident bridge-burning lyrics&quot;.\n\nErna's singing style has been stated as &quot;the snarl of James Hetfield&quot;, and &quot;composed of dark harmony that sounds a lot like Alice in Chains&quot;.Merrill's bass style has been described as &quot;bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb&quot;. Larkin's drumming is thought to &quot;worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham&quot;.And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as &quot;guitars that sound like percussion instruments&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984a72d63bda3e732b68759a6fb07104ca88ff69","amp;dn":"Godsmack+-+1000hp++MP3+++320k+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984a72d63bda3e732b68759a6fb07104ca88ff69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,74,114,214,59,218,62,115,43,104,117,154,111,176,113,4,202,136,255,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
