She could have never imagined that she would be agreeing to the proposition of a lifetime. Every woman in Stone River, Texas would jump at this chance, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll leave pieces of her heart behind. Raised on their family ranch the four Brooks brothers have always shared everything. Even women. When they find themselves face to face with the one person who could complete them all, they set out on a journey to claim her for their own. Fate can place them all in the right place at the right time, but will Rachel be able to overcome her relationship scars, or is she destined to live her life alone believing that no man ever stays?\n\nFlawless Surrender (The Surrender #2)\nThe strength of a man is in the way he embraces his flaws, instead of denying them. Zoey Carson has worked nonstop to graduate with her Masters degree, after managing to survive parents who neglected her in favor of their own addictions. Her future of helping children overcome their childhood is within her grasp until she is knocked down by a surprise visit from her mother. She finds herself at a crossroads when her longtime crush, Tanner Keegan, comes to her rescue, along with his brothers, Dalton and Clint. Letting them go might help her avoid getting hurt, but the outcomeÃ¢â‚¬â€she would continue to live a lonely, empty life. The Keegan brothers finally come together after spreading themselves across the globe for more than a decade. Each fighting his own personal battle with the past and future, but there is no question that Zoey turns them all on. Who will risk the pain of baring their soul for the promise of a happy future, and who will succumb to their weaknesses? Return to Stone River, Texas, where the Keegan brothers work together to win the heart of the woman made for them.
