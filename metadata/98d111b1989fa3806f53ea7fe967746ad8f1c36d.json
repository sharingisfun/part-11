Now, this master of political humor strikes again with a powerful and provocative message for all of us.\n\nIn these pages, Al reveals the alarming story of how:\n\nBush (barely) beat Kerry with his campaign of Ã¢â‚¬Å“fear, smear, and queers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then claimed a nonexistent mandate. \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Casino JackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Abramoff, the RepublicansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nearest and dearest friend, made millions of dollars off of the unspeakable misery of the poor and the powerless. And, also, Native Americans. \nThe administration successfully implemented its strategy to destroy AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s credibility and goodwill around the world. \nComplete with new material for this paperback edition, The Truth (with jokes) is more than just entertaining, intelligent, and insightful. It is at once prescient in its analysis of right-wing mendacity and incompetence, and inspiring in its vision of a better tomorrow for all Americans (except Jack Abramoff).&quot;\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly (Starred Review): &quot;Franken and his research team return to what they do best: detailing allegations and accusations being spread by right-wing pundits and then debunking them point-by-point. While numerous tomes have taken on the administration's creative definition of &quot;facts,&quot; few have the massive readership of satirist Franken or his wickedly sly sense of humor. In many ways, the unabridged audio is superior to the bound book because listeners can enjoy Franken's deadpan comedic delivery. Another audio bonus is that rather than Franken reading the text he's about to redress, he provides the actual soundclips so listeners can hear George W. stumble over his words, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh bluster and Zell Miller contradict himself. Franken is such an uncanny mimic that listeners will find it hard to tell which Karl Rove and Dick Cheney sound bites are real and which are Franken's dead-on impersonations. Listeners will find Franken's directness refreshing (he calls Bush an &quot;utterly shameless liar&quot; and says his administration is &quot;fixing the intelligence and facts around the policy.&quot;). The penultimate chapter is Franken's stirring call to arms to &quot;throw these guys out in 2006.&quot; This is essential listening for those who want ammunition to fight to preserve their human rights.&quot; \n\nThis is only the PDF editon of the book and it is large and a bit weird. It looks like a high-resolution scan of the book and when I went to convert it for an EPUB version, it came out all strange and inverted so I discarded it. However, the PDF is quite readable so there should be no issues there. The front cover is included as well. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d111b1989fa3806f53ea7fe967746ad8f1c36d","amp;dn":"The+Truth+%28With+Jokes%29+by+Al+Franken+%282005%7CDutton%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d111b1989fa3806f53ea7fe967746ad8f1c36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,209,17,177,152,159,163,128,111,83,234,127,233,103,116,106,216,241,195,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
