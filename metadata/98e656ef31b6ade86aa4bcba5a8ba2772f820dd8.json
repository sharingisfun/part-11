Computational techniques can now explain exotic nonlinear behaviour, transition to chaos and the formation of structures that can be observed on the surface of the Sun. Here, two leading experts present the current state of knowledge of the subject. They provide a mathematical and numerical treatment of the interactions between electrically conducting fluids and magnetic fields that lead to the complex structures and rich behaviour observed on the Sun and other stars, as well as in the interiors of planets like the Earth. The authors' combined analytical and computational approach provides a model for the study of a wide range of related problems. The discussion includes bifurcation theory, chaotic behaviour, pattern formation in two and three dimensions, and applications to geomagnetism and to the properties of sunspots and other features at the solar surface.\n\nBook Description\nHere, leading experts present the current state of knowledge of the subject of magnetoconvection: the study of the interplay between magnetic fields and convection. The book covers all aspects of the subject from the viewpoint of applied mathematics, and as a branch of astrophysical (or geophysical) fluid dynamics.\n\nAbout the Author\nN. O. Weiss is Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Clare College. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a former President of the Royal Astronomical Society, which awarded him a Gold Medal in 2007. His research has centred on astrophysical fluid dynamics and especially on nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic interactions between convection and magnetic fields in the Sun and other stars, as well as in the Earth.\n\nM. R. E. Proctor is Professor of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics at the University of Cambridge and Provost of King's College, having been for many years a Fellow of Trinity College. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Institute of Mathematics and Applications. His early research was concerned with nonlinear models of the geomagnetic field. More recently he has contributed to a number of research areas, including dynamical systems and pattern formation, solar dynamo theory and the interactions of magnetic fields and convection in the Sun.\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (30 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 052119055X\nISBN-13: 978-0521190558","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e656ef31b6ade86aa4bcba5a8ba2772f820dd8","amp;dn":"Magnetoconvection+%28Cambridge+Monographs+on+Mechanics%29%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e656ef31b6ade86aa4bcba5a8ba2772f820dd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,230,86,239,49,182,173,232,106,164,188,186,90,139,162,119,47,130,13,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
