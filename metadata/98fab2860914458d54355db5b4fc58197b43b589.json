Kirk, Wen-mei W. Hwu, &quot;Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach&quot;\nMK | 2010 | ISBN: 0123814723 | 280 pages | PDF\n\nMulti-core processors are no longer the future of computing-they are the present day reality. A typical mass-produced CPU features multiple processor cores, while a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) may have hundreds or even thousands of cores. With the rise of multi-core architectures has come the need to teach advanced programmers a new and essential skill: how to program massively parallel processors.\n\nProgramming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach shows both student and professional alike the basic concepts of parallel programming and GPU architecture. Various techniques for constructing parallel programs are explored in detail. Case studies demonstrate the development process, which begins with computational thinking and ends with effective and efficient parallel programs.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Teaches computational thinking and problem-solving techniques that facilitate high-performance parallel computing.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Utilizes CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), NVIDIA's software development tool created specifically for massively parallel environments.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Shows you how to achieve both high-performance and high-reliability using the CUDA programming model as well as OpenCL.
