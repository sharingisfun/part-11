Released on Handsome Boy Records, the EP was popular on Canadian campus radio, and led to a major label distribution deal with BMG Records for their full length album Fluke in 1995.\n\nLed by the hit single &quot;Misogyny&quot;, which featured a video consisting of clips from Canadian filmmaker Bruce LaBruce's film Hustler White, Fluke was the band's commercial breakthrough, also spawning the singles &quot;Wake Me&quot;, &quot;Groovy Dead&quot; and &quot;California&quot;, and earning a Juno Award nomination for Best Alternative Album. In 1996, the band contributed a cover of &quot;Let's Break Robert Out of Jail&quot; to the compilation album A Tribute to Hard Core Logo.\n\nThe band's followup album, Sophomoric, was released in 1997, including the singles &quot;Empty Cell&quot; and &quot;Oh No Joe&quot;. Perkins left the band that year and was replaced by John Lalley. Perkins left the group due to creative differences and released an electronic album independently with Andrew Massey under the name &quot;Blu Pernu&quot;.\n\nIn 1998, Rusty released Out of Their Heads. The band subsequently broke up, playing their final show on November 25, 2000..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992d78ccd84cae47b10e63a9fbd8cf2ea9a62b9a","amp;dn":"Rusty+-+Fluke+%5B1995%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992d78ccd84cae47b10e63a9fbd8cf2ea9a62b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,45,120,204,216,76,174,71,177,14,99,169,251,216,207,46,169,166,43,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
