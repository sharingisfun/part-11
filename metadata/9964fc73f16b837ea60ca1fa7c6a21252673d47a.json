Ft. &quot;Seven's Company&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Moores are so busy with their individual schedules that they find it hard to get everyone together in the same room on most days. They're looking for a tiny house that can not only get them spending more time together but that can accommodate workspaces for 3 boys who are homeschooling, mom and dad who are working on their degrees, and enough space for musical jam sessions. Not to mention they have 2 older sons that frequently like to come visit and take advantage of some home cooked meals. That's right seven people in one tiny house, so needless to say, John and Zack will have their hands full with this one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 07-May-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9964fc73f16b837ea60ca1fa7c6a21252673d47a","amp;dn":"Tiny+House+Nation+S04E07+545+Sq+Ft+Sevens+Company+WEB-DL.x264-JI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9964fc73f16b837ea60ca1fa7c6a21252673d47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,100,252,115,241,107,131,126,166,12,161,250,124,106,33,37,38,115,212,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
