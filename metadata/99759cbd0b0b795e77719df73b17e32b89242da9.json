The only person she can trust is Cary GrantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suave, mysterious stranger. Director Stanley Donen goes deliciously dark for Charade, a glittering emblem of sixties style and macabre wit.\n\nThe film is notable for its screenplay, especially the repartee between Grant and Hepburn, for having been filmed on location in Paris, for Henry Mancini's score and theme song, and for the animated titles by Maurice Binder. Charade has been referred to as the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made.\n\nAudrey Hepburn's line, at any moment we could be assassinated, was dubbed over to become at any moment we could be eliminated due to the recent assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Subsequent versions of the film have restored the original dialogue.\n\nCary Grant (59 years old at the time) was sensitive about the age difference between Audrey Hepburn (at age 34) and him, and this made him uncomfortable with the romantic interplay between them. To satisfy his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to add several lines of dialogue in which Grant's character comments on his age and Regina not Grant's character is portrayed as the pursuer.\n\nThe screenwriter, Peter Stone, and the director, Stanley Donen, have an unusual joint cameo role in the film. When Reggie goes to the U.S. Embassy to meet with Bartholomew, two men get on the elevator as she gets off. The man who says, I bluffed the old man out of the last pot with a pair of deuces, is Stone, but the voice is Donen's. Stone's voice is later used for the U.S. Marine who is guarding the Embassy at the end of the film.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Charade (1963)[DVDRip][big_dad_e]\\Charade (1963)[DVDRip][big_dad_e].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.06 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 341 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate                         : 1 199 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.116\nStream size                      : 974 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 104 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.96.1\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5102\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/12/2010 9:42:32 PM\nmbam-log-2010-11-12 (21-42-32).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 15 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
