Swartz (Author)\nPaperback: 408 pages\nPublisher: Productivity Press; 1 edition (June 21, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439872961\nISBN-13: 978-1439872963\nFormat: Retail PDF\nNOTE: this is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nHealthcare Kaizen focuses on the principles and methods of daily continuous improvement, or Kaizen, for healthcare professionals and organizations. Kaizen is a Japanese word that means &quot;change for the better,&quot; as popularized by Masaaki Imai in his 1986 book Kaizen: The Key to JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Competitive Success and through the books of Norman Bodek, both of whom contributed introductory material for this book.\n\nWinner of a 2013 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award!\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, endorsed the principles of Kaizen in the New England Journal of Medicine, describing it as &quot;the continuous search for opportunities for all processes to get better.&quot; This book shows how to make this goal a reality.\n\nHealthcare Kaizen shares some of the methods used by numerous hospitals around the world, including Franciscan St. Francis Health, where co-author Joe Swartz has led these efforts. Most importantly, the book covers the management mindsets and philosophies required to make Kaizen work effectively in a hospital department or as an organization-wide program.\nAll of the examples in the book were shared by leading healthcare organizations, with over 200 full-color pictures and visual illustrations of Kaizen-based improvements that were initiated by nurses, physicians, housekeepers, senior executives and other staff members at all levels.\n\nHealthcare Kaizen will be helpful for organizations that have embraced weeklong improvement events, but now want to follow the lead of ThedaCare, Virginia Mason Medical Center, and others who have moved beyond just doing events into a more complete management system based on Lean or the Toyota Production System.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often said, without much reflection, that people hate change. The experiences shared in this book prove that people actually love change when they are fully engaged in the process, get to make improvements that improve patient care and make their day less frustrating, and when they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fear being laid off as a result of their improvements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:997a5a204eb79ca9332588b27867b0f17eb3db40","amp;dn":"Healthcare+Kaizen-+Graban+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"997a5a204eb79ca9332588b27867b0f17eb3db40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,122,90,32,78,183,156,169,51,37,136,178,120,103,176,241,126,179,219,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
