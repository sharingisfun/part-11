The plots are nonsense, the &quot;action&quot; is less than thrilling by today's standards, the villians are all boring crooks and Martha Kent is still known only as &quot;Mary&quot;. BUT, it's still classic and worth a read if you are a fan of the Man of Steel. Thanks to the scanners for their efforts, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99c7eef9391de43bb717c4eb64045f2dc0446625","amp;dn":"Superman+001+%281939%29+%28Digital%29+%28TLK-EMPIRE-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99c7eef9391de43bb717c4eb64045f2dc0446625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,199,238,249,57,29,228,59,183,23,196,235,100,4,95,45,192,68,102,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
