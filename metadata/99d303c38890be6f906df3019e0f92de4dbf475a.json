It stars Shirley MacLaine and features John McMartin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ricardo Montalban, Chita Rivera, Paula Kelly and Stubby Kaye. It is based on the 1966 stage musical of the same name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which Fosse had also directed and choreographed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which in turn is based on Federico Fellini, Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli's screenplay for Fellini's film Le Notti di Cabiria (Nights of Cabiria). However, where Fellini's black-and-white film concerns the romantic ups-and-downs of an ever-hopeful prostitute, the musical makes the central character a dancer-for-hire at a Times Square dance-hall.\n\nThe film is notable for its costumes by Edith Head and its dance sequences, notably &quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot;.\n\nALSO INCLUDED:\n\nAlternate ending\nAn alternate ending picks up after Oscar leaves Charity. Oscar starts to go crazy in his apartment and, feeling suffocated, goes for a walk in the park. He sees Charity on their bridge in Central Park and thinks she is going to jump. Racing to rescue her, he trips and falls in the water. Charity jumps in after him, but can't swim so Oscar rescues her. Oscar realizes Charity is the only breath of fresh air in his life, proposes again, and she accepts. Fosse thought the ending was too corny, but filmed it in apprehension that the studio would demand a happy ending. In the end, though, they agreed with Fosse and kept the original ending from the stage version. (Unfortunately, the alternate ending is not the best quality, but I thought it would be enjoyable for those who are fans of the original film).\n\nCast:\n\nShirley MacLaine as Charity Hope Valentine\nJohn McMartin as Oscar Lindquist\nRicardo Montalban as Vittorio Vitale\nChita Rivera as Nickie\nPaula Kelly as Helene\nStubby Kaye as Herman\nBarbara Bouchet as Ursula\nSammy Davis, Jr. as Big Daddy Brubeck\nBen Vereen as &quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot; dancer\n\nMusical numbers:\n\n&quot;My Personal Property&quot;\n&quot;(Hey,) Big Spender&quot;\n&quot;The Pompeii Club&quot;\n&quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot;\n&quot;If They Could See Me Now&quot;\n&quot;The Hustle&quot;\n&quot;There's Got to Be Something Better Than This&quot;\n&quot;It's a Nice Face&quot;\n&quot;The Rhythm of Life&quot;\n&quot;Sweet Charity&quot;\n&quot;I'm a Brass Band&quot;\n&quot;I Love to Cry at Weddings&quot;\n&quot;Where Am I Going?&quot;\n\nEnjoy!
