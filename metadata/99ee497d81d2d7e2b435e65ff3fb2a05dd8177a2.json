It was directed by John \r\nGlenister.\r\n\r\nThis dramatization brings to life the wit and humour of Jane \r\nAusten's arguably finest novel Emma, recreating her most \r\nirritatingly endearing female character, of whom she wrote \r\n&quot;no one but myself could like.&quot;\r\n\r\nEmma presides over the small provincial world of Highbury with \r\nenthusiasm, but she will find that it is all too easy to confuse \r\ngood intentions with self-gratification. The often insensitive, \r\nwell-meaning, incorrigible Emma Woodhouse having engineered the \r\nmarriage of governess, companion and friend Miss Taylor, now \r\nturns her attention towards making a match for Mr Elton, the local \r\nvicar, and her new protÃ©gÃ©e Harriet Smith. Her one voice of reason \r\nand restraint is Mr Knightley, who has known her since she was a \r\nchild and who watches her behaviour with wry amusement and \r\nsometimes with real anger.\r\n\r\nFILE INFO:\r\n\r\nContainers......: mkv\r\nFile Size.......: 2,60 GB (444 MB per episode)\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x540 (4:3)\r\nVideo Codec.....: x264 (Profile Level   )\r\nVideo Quality...: Constant Quality RF: 22,0\r\nAudio...........: 2 channels, aac, 160 kbps\r\nAudio Language..: English\r\nSoft-Coded Subs.: English (VobSub, muxed in)\r\n                  English (separate .SRTs)\r\nFrame Rate......: 25,000 fps\r\nSource..........: DVD Box Set (PAL)\r\nSample..........: Included\r\n\r\nScreenshots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ee497d81d2d7e2b435e65ff3fb2a05dd8177a2","amp;dn":"%5BJane+Austen%5D+Emma+%281972%29+DVDRip+540p+x264+aac+2.0+%5BMKV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ee497d81d2d7e2b435e65ff3fb2a05dd8177a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,238,73,125,129,210,215,226,180,53,230,95,243,251,42,5,221,129,119,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
