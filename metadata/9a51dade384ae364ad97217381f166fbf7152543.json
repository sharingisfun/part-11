But with four mountain passes to traverse, today is quite possibly the hardest of the whole race. The tight elimination time will force the sprinters to push themselves to their limits all day in order to stay in the race, and with a summit finish up the HC Pla d'Adet, the action at the front is bound to be fierce. Presented by Gary Imlach with analysis from Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen with Ned Boulting the reporter at the roadside.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 2.03 GB\nRun-Time__: 3 hours\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=26 ~1522Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 24/48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\ndb.tt/wHGqEnKq\ntwitter[dot]com/JungleBoyNX\n\nI'm off on holiday on 26th July for one week so I won't be uploading the last 2 stages (stages 20 and 21) but I'll upload them a week later on 3rd August when I get back.
