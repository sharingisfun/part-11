Introduction to Algorithms combines rigor and comprehensiveness.\n\nThe book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.\n\nThe first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a72649ae57565169cf6da3dd9d4418c937cd12c","amp;dn":"t._cormen_-_introduction_to_algorithms_3rd_edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a72649ae57565169cf6da3dd9d4418c937cd12c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,114,100,154,229,117,101,22,156,246,218,61,217,212,65,140,147,124,209,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
