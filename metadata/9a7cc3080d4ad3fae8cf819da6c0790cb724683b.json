Karthikeyan et al. (Springer, 2016).epub\r\n\r\nThis book presents the latest advances in and current research perspectives on the field of urban/industrial solid waste recycling for bio-energy and bio-fuel recovery. It chiefly focuses on five main thematic areas, namely bioreactor landfills coupled with energy and nutrient recovery; microbial insights into anaerobic digestion; greenhouse emission assessment; pyrolysis techniques for special waste treatment; and industrial waste stabilization options. In addition, it compiles the results of case studies and solid waste management perspectives from different countries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7cc3080d4ad3fae8cf819da6c0790cb724683b","amp;dn":"Recycling+of+Solid+Waste+for+Biofuels+and+Bio-chemicals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7cc3080d4ad3fae8cf819da6c0790cb724683b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,124,195,8,13,74,211,250,232,207,129,157,166,192,121,12,183,36,104,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
