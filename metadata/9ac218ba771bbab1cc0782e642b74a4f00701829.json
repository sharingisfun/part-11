Wild Cherry was rewarded with a number of accolades shortly thereafter, including being named Best Pop Group of the Year by Billboard, receiving an American Music Award for Top R&amp;B Single of the Year, and even earning a pair of Grammy nominations for Best New Vocal Group and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Group or Duo. But Wild Cherry proved to be susceptible to the dreaded sophomore jinx and as their follow-up recording, 1977's Electrified Funk, failed to spawn any hits and sunk from sight shortly after its release, as did such further releases as 1978's I Love My Music, plus 1979's Only the Wild Survive and Don't Wait Too Long; Wild Cherry split up the same year (with Parissi eventually turning up later as a disc jockey in Wheeling, WV). Wild Cherry's lone hit remains a favorite in dance clubs to this day, as a pair of collections were issued after their split: Play the Funk and Super Hits. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\t\t\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Play That Funky Music\n02.Baby Don't You Know\n03.99 12\n04.Don't Go Near The Water\n05.Electrified Funk\n06.Hot To Trot\n07.It's All Up To You\n08.It's The Same Old Song\n09.I Love My Music\n10.Try A Piece Of My Love\n\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac218ba771bbab1cc0782e642b74a4f00701829","amp;dn":"Wild+Cherry+-+Play+The+Funk+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac218ba771bbab1cc0782e642b74a4f00701829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,194,24,186,119,27,186,177,204,7,130,230,66,183,74,79,0,112,24,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
