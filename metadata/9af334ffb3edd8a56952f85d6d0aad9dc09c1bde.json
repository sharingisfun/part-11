Not coincidentally, that was the same year mankind last had Thanksgiving dinner.\nWe should have seen it coming. It was the logical conclusion of our perennial turkey oppression. Years of slicing, dicing, chopping, and carving in the name of tastiness. Gobble-gobble, indeed.\nEven as the revolution flared, we thought it would be easy. We thought they were dim-witted, clumsy, unworthy adversaries. We thought they would soon be on our Thanksgiving dinner table again. We thought wrong.\nThey had outside help. Intergalactic turkeys flocked to the aid of their earthly brethren. They were intelligent, organized, technologically advanced. And they were merciless.\nIt's now time for you to fight for our ancestral right to turkey roast. Will you triumph over the foul fowls? Will mankind ever have Thanksgiving dinner again? Or will you end up as part of the menu in a galactic turkey restaurant?\n\nFeatures:\nUp to 4-player cooperative play!\nJourney to 12 star systems Ã¢â‚¬â€ across weird and wonderful foreign galaxies.\nFight through 120 waves of invading chickens.\nDiscover 9 awesome weapons Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus a secret one!\nUpgrade weapons through 11 power levels Ã¢â‚¬â€ and a supercharged 12th!\nCollect 30 unique bonuses.\nAcquire 15 medals Ã¢â‚¬â€ advance your chicken-hunting career.\nUnlock 20 secret features.\nInternet high score tables Ã¢â‚¬â€ compare yourself with people from all over the world!\nMultiplayer Ã¢â‚¬â€ play on the same computer, over your LAN, or on the internet.\nOver 20 minutes of original orchestral soundtrack\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.interactionstudios.com/padfiles/chickeninvaders4thanksgiving/ci4thanksgiving-sshot-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.interactionstudios.com/padfiles/chickeninvaders4thanksgiving/ci4thanksgiving-sshot-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.interactionstudios.com/padfiles/chickeninvaders4thanksgiving/ci4thanksgiving-sshot-4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.interactionstudios.com/padfiles/chickeninvaders4thanksgiving/ci4thanksgiving-sshot-4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTorrent Is Clean Any Alarms Will Be Just False Postive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af334ffb3edd8a56952f85d6d0aad9dc09c1bde","amp;dn":"Chicken.Invaders.Ultimate.Omelette.Thanksgiving.Edition.v4.17-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af334ffb3edd8a56952f85d6d0aad9dc09c1bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,243,52,255,179,237,216,165,105,82,248,93,109,10,173,157,192,156,27,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
