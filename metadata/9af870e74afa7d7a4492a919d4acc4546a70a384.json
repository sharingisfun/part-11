It was simply one tour too many. At this stage it was impossible to hide the fact that Elvis was in serious problems.\n In any case, the Lincoln concert is one of the finest shows from that last tour. Elvis sounds much better than in Omaha the day before. Surprises include a well-sung Ã¢â‚¬ËœHelp MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and arguably the best ever version of Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnchained MelodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which for the first and only time was performed before the band introductions. Interestingly, and completely unknown until now, is that Elvis asks J.D. Sumner and the Stamps to perform 'Walk That Lonesome Road' during the band intros, which is very unusual for the time frame.\n\n The June 20, 1977 show was first issued on CD in 2004 (Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ELVIS ROCKS LINCOLNÃ¢â‚¬Å“). This sloppy edition was taken from an incomplete source, missing 17 minutes. For the first time Straight Arrow offer this concert complete. Using two independent original audience recored tapes, Straight Arrow's sound engineer was able to restore all 73 minutes of Lincoln concert.\n \nEnjoy!\n\nTCB,\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af870e74afa7d7a4492a919d4acc4546a70a384","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Adios+Lincoln+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af870e74afa7d7a4492a919d4acc4546a70a384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,248,112,231,74,250,125,122,68,146,169,25,212,172,196,84,106,112,163,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
