This album, along with &quot;Sonny Side Up,&quot; &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; and the recently deleted &quot;With The Oscar Peterson Trio,&quot; are Sonny Stitt's finest recordings. &quot;Plays Bird&quot; finds Stitt playing with the stellar band of Jim Hall on guitar, John Lewis on piano, Richard Davis on bass, and Connie Kay on drums. While all these musicians are in top form, it is Hall's interplay with Stitt that truly distinguishes this CD. The album's best Parker renditions are &quot;Confirmation,&quot; &quot;Scrapple From The Apple&quot; and &quot;Ornithology.&quot; Additonally, the disc features two bonus selections, &quot;Now's The Time&quot; and &quot;Yardbird Suite,&quot; not included on the original record. One last thing, when you go buy this make sure you don't mistake it with &quot;Coltrane's Sound&quot; as they have remarkably similar cover paintings by artist Marvin Israel. ~ Michael B. Richman\n\nFrankly, for an artist who was considered derivative of Bird, this was a bold statement. Sonny's work on &quot;Stitt Plays Bird&quot; is every bit as virtuosic as Charlie Parker himself. The playing on Constellation (my favorite track) is outrageously fast and inventive--so fast and furious that there are times when the tone splits and goes off into oblivion, but the listener doesn't care because Sonny has already started a new line. This may be the most energizing CD of all time. Every chart on this album, including the previously unreleased charts, are strong. So strong in fact, that it caused me to lament the fact that I did not take Stitt seriously enough when he was alive. He was every bit as talented as Adderly or Parker. This album should be one of a treasury of Sonny Stitt CDs in your library. ~ Sparky\n\nPersonnel:\nSonny Stitt (alto saxophone)\nJohn Lewis (piano)\nJim Hall (guitar)\nRichard Davis (bass)\nConnie Kay (drums)\n\nSonny Stitt - Stitt Plays Bird Tracks:\n01  Now's the Time \n02  My Little Suede Shoes \n03  Parker's Mood \n04  Constellation \n05  Au Privave \n06  Hootie Blues \n07  Confirmation \n08  Ko-Ko \n09  Yardbird Suite \n10  Scrapple from the Apple \n11  Ornithology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b048335ac96a7fba04121b79699e9140a6bd9c7","amp;dn":"Sonny+Stitt+-+Stitt+Plays+Bird+%281963%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b048335ac96a7fba04121b79699e9140a6bd9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,4,131,53,172,150,167,251,160,65,33,183,150,153,233,20,10,107,217,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
