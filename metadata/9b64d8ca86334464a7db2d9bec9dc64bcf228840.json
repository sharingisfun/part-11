Other applications attempt to load the entire file into memory (grinding your system to a halt).\r\n- TextPipe's unique restrictions control precisely where changes are made. Restrict to a range of lines or columns, to specific Tab or CSV fields, between HTML/XML tags, and inside custom ranges. Restrictions can be combined, for example, to columns 1-10 of lines matching a pattern. Restrictions are essential for extensive but controlled search and replace\r\n- TextPipe performs multiple operations simultaneously. Other applications offer only 1, up to 5, or require a slow multi-pass approach\r\n- If TextPipe's 100+ filters don't suit your needs, you can use industry standard VBScript/JScript to write your own. Other applications either don't offer this facility, or force you to learn a proprietary language\r\n- TextPipe is unique in offering the EasyPattern pattern matching language for those not familiar with text pattern matching (regular expressions). EasyPatterns are English-like and very easy to learn\r\n- TextPipe can be scheduled for non-interactive use, and can be controlled by an external program. Other applications provide only a mouse interface.\r\n\r\nHomepage: http://www.datamystic.com/textpipe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b64d8ca86334464a7db2d9bec9dc64bcf228840","amp;dn":"DataMystic+TextPipe+Pro+9.9.4+%28Install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b64d8ca86334464a7db2d9bec9dc64bcf228840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,100,216,202,134,51,68,100,167,219,45,155,236,157,198,75,207,34,136,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
