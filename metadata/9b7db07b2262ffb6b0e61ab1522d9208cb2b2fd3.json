Fehrenbach of Texas culinary history. While Fehrenbach has chronicled Texas history, Walsh's books--The Tex-Mex Cookbook, Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook and The Texas Cowbo Cookbook--honor the state's food traditions with recipes and revisionist accounts of how our Lone Star staples came to be. Many of the articles he pens for the Houston Press--where he's been head restaurant reviewer for almost 10 years-- have been nominated for James Beard awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7db07b2262ffb6b0e61ab1522d9208cb2b2fd3","amp;dn":"The+Hot+Sauce+Cookbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7db07b2262ffb6b0e61ab1522d9208cb2b2fd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,125,176,123,34,98,255,182,176,230,26,177,82,45,146,8,203,43,47,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
