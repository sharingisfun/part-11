Daniel left his high-paying job as a money manager to marry his community organizer wife and work at a job he loves, leading group counseling sessions with recently paroled ex-cons. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to move on and start a private practice.\n\nBut before he leaves, he finds an envelope in his department mailboxÃ¢â‚¬â€one intended for someone else that was placed in his slot by accident. Inside it is an unsigned piece of paper, a note that says only Ã¢â‚¬Å“admit what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done or you will bleed for it. you have 'til november 15 at midnite.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The deadline has already passed and the person to whom the envelope was addressed was brutally murdered. But this first warning is only the beginning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd70f7dab6e6b5616aa558b277dab5dc0925c2a","amp;dn":"Gregg+Hurwitz-Tell+No+Lies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd70f7dab6e6b5616aa558b277dab5dc0925c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,215,15,125,171,110,107,86,22,170,85,139,39,125,171,93,192,146,92,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
