Mixing with analog devices sounds better to many people. There is a very elusive quality imparted that is missing in digital audio, there is more weight to a mix, and the overall sound is more three dimensional. Analog devices produce electrical artifacts that affect frequency response, add harmonics, cause signal clipping and increase noise. These artifacts, which audio engineers often consider the character of a particular device, result from a combination of factors such as component grade, technology type (i.e. vacuum tubes, ICs, transistors), power supply specifications, equipment casing and other variables.\nDepending on the circuit characteristics, input signal frequency response varies. Some circuits cut frequencies, others boost them. This behavior is part of the overall device character and should not be confused with user adjustable EQ.\nTotal harmonic distortion (THD) is based on the levels of the odd and even harmonics of an input signal, usually at a level much lower than the fundamental level. THD balance and decay are circuit dependent, and thus differ from device to device.\nCrossTalk and Noise are two elements which every designer tends to avoid to not affect the audio quality. Since in the analog world they can't be avoided, fortunately in digital domain with Volterra Technology we have reduced the noise at less of -120dBfs and completely avoided CrossTalk during the sampling.\nThe result is an optimum full quality sound from a like-new working condition hardware.\nWe have recreated these non linearity characteristics into D361A by sampling a unit in excellent condition (refurbished and modified by AlexB - Alessandro Boschi). Your tracks will become more alive with the classic vibe of a real hardware and you may notice that your mixes may take on an almost magical quality with punch, glue, and dimension that you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hear with your other algorithmically based plugins.\n\n\n\n\n\n       Controls\n\nInput Gain: sets the level at the input of the plugin. The range is from -Ã¢Ë†Å¾ dB to +6 dB.\n\nOutput Gain: sets the level at the output of the plugin. The range is from -Ã¢Ë†Å¾ dB to +6 dB.\n\nDrive Control: The Ã¢â‚¬Å“DriveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ control is a unique feature not found in similar products from others brands that comes from Acustica Audio VVKT proprietary technology and sampling aproach.\nIt allows you to control the amount of harmonic distortion that is coming from the analog hardware. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“InputÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ control acts as the analog signal chain of the device, where reducing the volume also reduces the harmonic distortion in accordance. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“DriveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ function allows independent control of this harmonic content, so that the input level can be left alone while making adjustments to the harmonics. Reducing the harmonics leads to a cleaner signal with an already clean device. Increasing the harmonics should be done with moderation. This type of effect is not truly representative of a real console, but it can be useful when you want more of the consoleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nonlinear Ã¢â‚¬Å“vibeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ without altering the channelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s levels. The range is from -12 dB to +12 dB. Note that increasing the input signal the internal headroom will be reduced.\n\nMode: These control switches change the circuit stage from the stock configuration to modified ones by changing frequency response, dynamics behaviour and harmonic contents. Four preset are available: Full : the stock circuit Mod.1-2-3 : the modified circuit.\nBypass: This switch control sets the plugin operative or bypassed\n\nMeters: Input and Output Meters display the levels at the input and output of the plugin in dBfs by changing the coloration also when clip occurs.\n\n\n\n  Presets\n\n\nFull: The Full preset is the sound of the original unit. It is useful for the whole mix and single tracks when punch and clarity are required.\n\nMod.1: The Mod. 1 preset is the sound of the first modification of the unit. It is useful for the whole mix, single tracks and mastering when body, dynamics and dimensional space are required.\n\nMod.2: The Mod. 2 preset is the sound of the second modification of the unit. It is useful for single tracks like voice, synthesizer, percussions, drums etc. when clarity or effect are required.\n\nMod.3: The Mod. 3 preset is the sound of the third modification of the unit. It is more enhanced than Mod.2 and it is useful for single tracks like voice, synthesizer, percussions, drums etc. when clarity or effect are required.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n   Sys Requirements\n\nWindows Minumum\n\nXp Sp2\nRam 2 Gb\nHd 120 Gb\nScreen Resolution 1024x768\nAudio Host VST compatible\nCPU Dual Core\n\nWindows Recommended\n\nLatest 64 bits version\n\nRam 24 Gb\nHd 120 Gb SSD\nScreen Resolution Full Hd\nAudio Host VST compatible\nLatest multicore CPU\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n  UnRaR\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run our keygen.\n4.Select a product.\n5.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n6.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\nOur Keygen gets Challenge Code automatically from your computer.\nHowever, you can get that code manually.\nChallenge Codes are identical for all plugins.\n(You don't need to load *.SER file one by one).\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run the plugin.\n *.SER (Challenge Code File) will be generated.\n4.Run our keygen.\n5.Select a product.\n6.Click &quot;Get From File&quot; and open that *.SER file.\n7.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n8.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
