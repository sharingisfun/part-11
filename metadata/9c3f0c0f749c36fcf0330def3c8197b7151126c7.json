The Jackson 5's infectious brand of funky pop-soul was a definite departure from the typically smooth, elegant Motown sound, as befitting the group's youth and the dawn of a new decade. That youth, coupled with the merchandising juggernaut that sprang up behind them, inevitably got them tagged a bubblegum group. But they were far more talented musically than that label would suggest, especially lead singer Michael, and their material, while sunny and upbeat, didn't pander to its audience. Solo careers and overexposure gradually weakened the Jackson 5, but their best music still holds up surprisingly well as some of the most vibrant mainstream pop/R&amp;B of its era.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.I Want You Back\n02.ABC\n03.Don't Know Why I Love You\n04.I'll Be There\n05.The Love You Save\n06.I Found That Girl\n07.Mama's Pearl\n08.Who's Lovin' You\n09.Goin' Back To Indiana\n10.Never Can Say Goodbye\n11.Sugar Daddy\n12.Maybe Tomorrow\n13.Lookin' Through The Windows\n14.Little Bitty Pretty One\n15.Teenage Symphony\n16.Corner Of The Sky\n17.Skywriter\n18.Hallelujah Day\n19.The Boogie Man\n20.I Am Love\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.I Hear A Symphony\n02.Get It Together\n03.Dancing Machine\n04.Whatever You Got,  I Want\n05.I Was Made To Love Her\n06.All I Do Is Think Of You\n07.Body Language\n08.Forever Came Today\n09.Got To Be There\n10.Rockin' Robin\n11.I Wanna Be Where You Are\n12.Ben\n13.We're Almost There\n14.Just A Little Bit Of You\n15.That's How Love Goes\n16.Love Don't Want To Leave\n17.Daddy's Home\n18.Let's Get Serious\n19.You're Supposed To Keep Your Love For Me\n20.Let Me Tickle Your Fancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP2P &amp; File Sharing Technology is completely legal.
