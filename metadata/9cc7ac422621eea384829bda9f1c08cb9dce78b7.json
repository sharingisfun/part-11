And, with the growing number of beer festivals popping up worldwide, beer is finally getting the attention and appreciation it deserves. For the average beer lover, the overwhelming choices, brewing styles and traditions can be confusing to say the least. Enter beer specialist Mirella Amato - one of only seven Certified Master Cicerones (beer sommeliers) in the world. With an advanced brewing certificate behind her, readers will be in expert hands as they navigate the multifaceted world of beer, guided by Amato's refreshingly accessible style.\n \nBroken down into fun, easy-to-read chapters, Beerology starts with an introduction to beer and tips on storage and cellaring, then leads into a guide on tasting. Amato presents beer styles in four groupsÃ¢â‚¬â€Refreshing, Mellow, Striking, and CaptivatingÃ¢â‚¬â€covering everything from the history and origins of specific brews, to brands that exemplify each type. She then gives tips on hosting beer-tasting parties at home, complete with beer games, and includes a chapter dedicated to beer cocktails (whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in for a delicious cucumber Pils?). Her original take on pairing beer with foodÃ¢â‚¬â€including chocolate and cheeseÃ¢â‚¬â€is perfect for anyone with an inquisitive mind and an epicurean streak.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my other Brewing Books, Zymurgy and BYO torrents\n                                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&lt;/a&gt;\t(NOTE: If TPB keeps changing domains (ie... .org to .sx to .se), you will have to change it yourselves to see my other torrents)\t \n\n\n***************************************\n\t\t\t\nAlways looking for new brewing books digital or otherwise.
