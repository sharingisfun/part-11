The FEF-3 is also fitted with diesel multiple unit (MU) controls, meaning it can run in tandem with a diesel locomotive, and features functioning in-cab signalling equipment. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Union Pacific FEF-3 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Sherman Hill route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read the Readme.pdf.\n\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ccc477b79bdbb8415689e0ec255a9f720082190","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Union+Pacific+FEF-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ccc477b79bdbb8415689e0ec255a9f720082190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,204,71,123,121,189,187,132,21,104,158,14,194,85,169,247,32,8,33,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
