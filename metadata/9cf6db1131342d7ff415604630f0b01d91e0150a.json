How did this happen? And does it have anything to do with all the water rushing down the water spout? Early readers have never been such fun! With bright color illustrations on every page, minimal easy-to-read text and a brilliantly fast-paced plot, this animal hospital adventure story will have young readers devouring the pages.\n\nThis is a fixed-format ebook, which preserves the design and layout of the original print book.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf6db1131342d7ff415604630f0b01d91e0150a","amp;dn":"Urgency+Emergency+Itsy+Bitsy+Spider+%28Dosh+Archer%29+Retail+PDF+%5BIt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf6db1131342d7ff415604630f0b01d91e0150a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,246,219,17,49,52,45,127,244,21,96,70,48,240,176,29,145,224,21,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
