It features every extant note Parker recorded for the Verve label as well as his appearances at Jazz at the Philharmonic. Parker recorded for Verve primarily in the last five years of his life, a period during which, besides playing with his famous quintet, he experimented with strings, Afro-Cuban jazz and mixed chorus. Among the albums produced during ParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Verve years were Bird &amp; Diz, Charlie Parker with Strings, and Swedish Schnapps.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    Original 10 CD release Bird: The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve, 1990 (Verve)\n\nDisc: 10\n\n1-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n2-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :27\n3-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:42\n4-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n5-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :17\n6-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi ChiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 6 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n7-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Remember YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n8-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now's The TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n9-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConfirmationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :14\n10- Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConfirmationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :09\n11- Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConfirmationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n12- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n13- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 False start And Rehearsal) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :32\n14- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 False start And Rehearsal) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :16\n15- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 Incomplete) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:05\n16- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :17\n17- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 6 Incomplete) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:08\n18- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get A Kick Out Of YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 7 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n19- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just One Of Those ThingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n20- Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Heart Belongs To DaddyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 False start And Rehearsal) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :36\n21- Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Heart Belongs To DaddyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n22- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I've Got You Under My SkinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n23- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :17\n24- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:47\n25- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Incomplete) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:03\n26- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:32\n27- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:35\n28- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love ParisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n29- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love ParisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d05299a1af459f50f434d9d3edb249cbf2604f9","amp;dn":"Bird+-+The+Complete+Charlie+Parker+on+Verve+vol.+10+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d05299a1af459f50f434d9d3edb249cbf2604f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,5,41,154,26,244,89,245,15,67,77,157,62,219,36,156,191,38,4,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
