Founded by guitarists Scott Ian and Danny Lilker, the band has since released ten studio albums and 20 singles, and an EP featuring Public Enemy. The band was one of the most popular of the 1980s thrash metal scene. When thrash metal began to gain a major following in the mid-to-late 1980s, Anthrax were dubbed one of the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. They were also one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Island Records, in 1985). As of 2004, Anthrax sold over 2.5 million records in the U.S and as of 2012, they have sold over 15 million records worldwide.\n\nThe band line-up has been changed numerous times; following the departure of drummer Dave Weiss and bassist Kenny Kushner, several musicians replaced both band members' roles, though Paul Kahn and Greg Walls were the first to do so. In addition to this aspect, there were multiple vocalists involved in Anthrax, with Neil Turbin, Joey Belladonna and John Bush being among the frontmen of the band. Scott Ian, however, has been in the band since its formation. Ian and Charlie Benante, who joined Anthrax in 1983, are the only constant members that appear on every album. Bassist Frank Bello has played on every album with exception of the band's debut. Classic singer Joey Belladonna has returned to the band and appears on Worship Music which is his first studio album with the band since 1990's Persistence of Time.\n\nAnthrax are set to unleash their new live DVD, the awesomely titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœChile on Hell,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ on Sept. 16. The release documents the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s May 10, 2013, show at the Teatro Caupolican in Santiago, Chile.\n\n\nScott Ian: Going in, we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what our performance was going to be like. You never know, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the thing about doing these kind of DVD shoots. The only thing we were able to have a guarantee on was how great the crowd was going to be, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we did it in Chile.\n\n\n\n\n01. Among The Living\n02. Caught In A Mosh\n03.
