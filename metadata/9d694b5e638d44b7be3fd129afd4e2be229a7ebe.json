The fairly large band is filled with distinctive soloists including trumpeter Jon Faddis (19 at the time), trombonist Al Grey, Billy Harper on tenor, altoist Norris Turney (heard on three versions of &quot;Sweet Meat,&quot; two of which were previously unreleased) and several percussionists among others. The weak points are Weston&amp;#039;s use of the Fender Rhodes on a few songs (it waters down his personality) and Candido&amp;#039;s chanting during an otherwise exciting version of &quot;Hi-Fly,&quot; but those are easily compensated for by the infectious calypso &quot;Jamaican East&quot; and Liston&amp;#039;s inventive reworking of &quot;Little Niles.&quot; Recommended.\n                                                                                                                (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
