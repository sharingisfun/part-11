Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow.\n\nWhat's New :\n\n9.2.2b3 Release Notes\nBugfixes:\n\nUnder certain circumstances Live 64 bit could crash while scanning VST plugins, after changing the input audio device or when opening a VST plugin window, especially when working with large Live Sets or if the program had been running for a very long time.\n\n9.2.2b2 Release Notes\nImprovements and feature changes:\n\nAdded control surface support for the Akai MIDImix\n\n9.2.2b1 Release Notes\nBugfixes:\n\nReplaced the icon for Current Project in the browser sidebar.\nLive would crash when dragging a Clip in the Groove Pool.\nAudio Units would stop passing audio after changing the sample rate.\n\nNotes :\n\n1.
