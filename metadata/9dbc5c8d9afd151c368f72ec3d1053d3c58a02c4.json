Rich covers how to merge multiple exposures to show an extended dynamic range of scenes, as well as preprocess images to reduce ghosting, noise, and chromatic aberration. He also reviews tone mapping and exposure fusions, and solutions to common problems you'll encounter in HDR images, such as color cast. At the end of the course, Rich offers a series of challenges to test your skills.\n\nThis course was created and produced by Rich Harrington. We're honored to host this material in our library.\nTopics include:\n\n    Loading bracketed photos\n    Aligning source images\n    Reducing noise and chromatic aberration\n    Tone mapping with methods\n    Fusing a single image or multiple images\n    Removing color cast\n    Automating with batch processing\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dbc5c8d9afd151c368f72ec3d1053d3c58a02c4","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+Photomatix+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dbc5c8d9afd151c368f72ec3d1053d3c58a02c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,188,92,141,154,253,21,28,54,143,114,236,61,16,83,211,197,138,2,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
