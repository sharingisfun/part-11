It took just a few million more to fully mature, a mere blink on the geological time scale. Structurally, anatomically, the human brain has not changed much in about two hundred thousand years. It is the same brain used by the first Homo sapiens to walk the planet. But what has evolved is the mind. And it is this inner universe that has so mystified and beguiled us. The mind, together with the brain, forms the most complex system known to man. At the dawn of the 21st Century, we are slowly crossing the borders of this last frontier, so that we may understand better who we are why we create and invent, why our fears haunt us, our thoughts liberate us, where we prove our free will, our sense of self and express our inner voice. New mind-imaging techniques are giving researchers a tool for mapping the mind. Never before could we look this closely inside the living brain.\n\n\nSeries Information\n\nComplex and deeply mysterious, the human brain is an odyssey unto itself. Take this journey into the inner workings of the mind with the guidance of scientist Dr. David Suzuki, the host of this riveting Discovery Channel documentary. This series explores the way the brain evolves from birth to adulthood; how memory works; how humans recover from brain injury; and the origins of creativity and identity.\n\n\nNarrated by David Suzuki\nWritten &amp; Directed by Masakatsu Takao &amp; Shunya Hirano\nEdited by Nobuto Sawamura &amp; Josh Berkley\nMusic by Joe Hisaishi\n\n\nAll credits go to PolarBear for creating and uploading.\n\n\nTO BE CONTINUED... \nSEE EPISODES 1, 2 and 3 AMONG MY POSTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc904c983c2b09f1f9fbfb18d7008e9d5d7e3f8","amp;dn":"The+Brain%3A+Our+Universe+Within%3B+Ep.4-Matter+over+Mind+%28Discovery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc904c983c2b09f1f9fbfb18d7008e9d5d7e3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,201,4,201,131,194,176,159,31,159,191,177,141,112,8,233,213,215,227,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
