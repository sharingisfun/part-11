The core gameplay consists of elements of a third-person shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, eating, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing (the first GTA game in which swimming and climbing are possible) and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand to hand combat. Players can drive a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles and bikes. Players may also import vehicles rather than steal them.\n\n\nif you don't like this game there is something wrong with you homie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9de956d38162d6112566390e824013016c7d6de5","amp;dn":"grand+theft+auto+san+andreas+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9de956d38162d6112566390e824013016c7d6de5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,233,86,211,129,98,214,17,37,102,57,14,130,64,19,1,108,125,109,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
