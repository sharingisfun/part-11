New DeepScreen technology allows avast! to make more intelligent decisions about new/unknown files. DeepScreen is a successor of AutoSandbox, now upgraded with some additional new technologies such as dynamic binary translation and dyna-gen announced earlier.\n2. New Hardened mode for stricter lockdown scenarios. This is a new mode that is recommended especially for novice users (such as your grandmas): it automatically blocks execution of binaries that would normally be deepscreened (Moderate level) or even allows only execution of programs that are well-known to FileRep (Aggressive level). In a way, it brings the whitelisting concept to the consumer AV space.\n3. Improved cloud scanning features and crowdsourced analysis of suspicious items. This includes new, optimized mechanism for collecting data from our sensors.\n4. Continuously streaming update (CSU) technology for up-to-minute detections. This is not entirely new for v2014, but we now have really buttoned up the whole streaming update infrastructure to allow for reliable, uninterrupted service. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently doing 350-400 updates a day, which equals to one update in roughly every 3.75 minutes, 24x7, 365 days a year. Streaming updates can now also carry more types of definitions than before.\n5. Improved cleaning of malware. This applies to standard malware as well as rootkits and file infectors.\n\n\nOther new features\n\n1. All-new web browser plugins featuring comprehensive security ratings, protection against malware, phishing and typosquatting sites and Do-Not-Track (DNT) functionality for improved anonymity on the Internet. The DNT functionality doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rely on the DNT HTTP headers; instead, it uses a proprietary technology that cannot be overridden by the servers.\n2. All-new SafeZone for more secure online shopping and banking. Users can now switch back and forth between SafeZone and the regular browser with a single click. Also, online banking sites can be automatically opened in the SafeZone.\n3. Rescue disk - allow users to create a bootable CD or flash disk with Avast on it. Great for cleaning.\n\n\nOther improvements\n\n1. A new, streamlined user interface for simplified navigation and more user comfort. The new UI is actually much simplified, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably the biggest change since version 5.0. We have also redefined the shields to the total number of three (File Shield, Web Shield, Mail Shield) and tweaked the action buttons (tiles) on the home page so that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now fully configurable.\n2. Control and manage all protected devices directly from the Avast console. That is, the my.avast.com account is perfectly integrated in the UI to allow for management of all your devices running Avast.\n3. Dramatic reduction in product size (full installer &lt; 60MB, compared to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 120MB) and memory footprint. By default, install is done through a new stub installer though (which has the advantage of always installing the most up-to-date version).\n4. Faster scanning thanks to optimized scanning engine (raw [in-memory] scans of EXE files are about 2x faster, while scans of text contents (e.g. web pages and scripts) are up to 10x faster).\n5. Completely rewritten setup/updater that makes the installation and upgrade process faster, easier and more reliable\n6. Firewall has been redesigned from scratch to allow for better compatibility with latest Windows, better performance and full support for IPv6 (although its UI hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really changed).\n7. New licensing system allows for much easier management of product licenses. The system relies on activation codes, and these can be added seamlessly by simply clicking a link.\n8. Various improvement in the Software Updater and Browser Cleanup tool.\n\n***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****\n\nKnown issues\n\n- some inconsistencies in time entries in local statistics\n- problems with sandboxing on win XP\n- boot-time scan scheduling problems\n- DeepScreen is still under development\n- sometimes after upgrade from the sfx installer, the product requires manual license activation\n- IE online security plugin not complete yet\n- FW random BSODes\n- Hardened mode not fully enabled yet\n- this build doesn't contain the new Web Shield drivers yet\n- minor issues with account registration\n- non-English language packs haven't been updated and may not work correctly\n\n\nP.S: If Its Instable you Still Can install the previous stable version in the other floder, USE The Keys For registration ***the keys given here dont work for avast 9 beta1***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e35658b18072c1dee5cbdc9c3b8c8299924aa3f","amp;dn":"Avast+9+Free+%28Build+9.0.2000.50%29+Beta+1%2BAvast+8+Free+%28Build+8.0.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e35658b18072c1dee5cbdc9c3b8c8299924aa3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,53,101,139,24,7,44,29,238,92,189,201,195,184,200,41,153,36,170,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
