In the first round the competitors must work with what is left in a casserole dish and at the bottom of a takeout bag. The second round has the chefs wondering what to do with something soggy and something sweet. In the final round -- featuring a leftover party beverage -- one chef beats the other to the ice cream machine, leaving his competitor scrambling for a new plan.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 17-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e65599e4123fdec7282835734de587347d915c7","amp;dn":"Chopped.S17E05.We.Love.Leftovers.HDTV.x264-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e65599e4123fdec7282835734de587347d915c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,101,89,158,65,35,253,236,114,130,131,87,52,222,88,115,71,217,21,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
