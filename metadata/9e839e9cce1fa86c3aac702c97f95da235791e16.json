Self-funded, as the first of Stars' releases for their own Soft Revolution Records, The Five Ghosts finds the fivesome mainly playing it safe. As suggested by the title, the album involves a loose concept about ghosts, with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Died So I Could Haunt YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“He Dreams HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Awake,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as it tips back and forth between melancholy yet shiny ballads and saturated, coffeehouse dance music. Beats recall Postal Service's Give Up, with added Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s glitter courtesy of some newly acquired synthesizers and drum programs, but unfortunately, their approach feels more retro-dated than retro-cool. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible that, by writing together in the studio, the controlled environment lent itself to a more sterile sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also likely that Amy Millan used up a lot of ideas while making her solo album a year prior. While a few hooks stand out -- particularly the Ã¢â‚¬Å“fisticuffsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“FixedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- most of the songs are too watered down, lyrically and musically, to be truly enticing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e839e9cce1fa86c3aac702c97f95da235791e16","amp;dn":"Stars+-+The+Five+Ghosts+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e839e9cce1fa86c3aac702c97f95da235791e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,131,158,156,206,31,168,108,58,172,112,44,151,249,93,162,53,121,30,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
