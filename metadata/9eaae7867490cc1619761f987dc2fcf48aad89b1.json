That, of course, was aborted when his father murdered him. Dream of a Lifetime is a mish-mash of tracks that range from bare-bones newer work as well as early-'70s Motown throwaways. The big hit, the percolating &quot;Sanctified Lady,&quot; picks up where Midnight Love left off. Gaye originally sung another word instead of &quot;lady&quot;; part of it is still audible and it's still shocking, but not surprising. &quot;Savage in the Sack&quot; has Gaye playing on old-aged myths and having the time of his life. Despite the ready laughs, Gaye's sexual fantasies are often on the dark side here. &quot;Masochistic Beauty&quot; showcases a pedestrian rhythm as Gaye sings in the world's worst English accent as he says, &quot;If you do it right, you'll get the pipe.&quot; For some it's unsettling, but it's also hilarious especially as he employs a vocoder as his lewd partner in crime. The Motown-era tracks come from various sessions from the '70s. While that fact would denote quality if not &quot;treasures,&quot; there are few to be found here. &quot;Life's Opera&quot; and the title track are both heavy-handed with their overwrought sentiments. Only &quot;It's Madness&quot; with it's patently early-'70s production style rises above the muck. Unlike many of Gaye's posthumous releases, Dream of a Lifetime offers a fair amount of dispensable work.
