Readers will be shocked and dismayed to discover that psychiatry, in the name of helping others, has actually been helping itself.In a style reminiscent of Ben GoldacreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bad Science and investigative in tone, James Davies reveals psychiatryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden failings and how the field of study must change if it is to ever win back its patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trust.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f18184ce44d514df2862295c6fb77c6562dd1a0","amp;dn":"Cracked%3A+The+Unhappy+Truth+about+Psychiatry+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f18184ce44d514df2862295c6fb77c6562dd1a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,24,24,76,228,77,81,77,242,134,34,149,198,251,119,198,86,45,209,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
