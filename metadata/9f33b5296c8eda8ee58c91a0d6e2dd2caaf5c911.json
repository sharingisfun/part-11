This two disc set    |\n|  showcases everything from their remarkable studio recordings to           |\n|  unreleased live performances, which were voted by their dedicated fans.   |\n|  It features amazing studio tracks like &quot;Crash Into Me,&quot; &quot;The Space        |\n|  Between,&quot; and &quot;American Baby&quot; in addition to the live tracks like &quot;Ants   |\n|  Marching,&quot; &quot;Everyday,&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye.&quot;                                 |\n|                                                                            |\n|  The South African vocalist/guitarist Dave Matthews formed the Dave        |\n|  Matthews Band in Virginia in the early &amp;#039;90s. Featuring Matthews, Stefan   |\n|  Lessard, Leroi Moore, Boyd Tinsley, and Carter Beauford, the group&amp;#039;s      |\n|  music presents a more pop-oriented version of the Grateful Dead crossed   |\n|  with the worldbeat explorations of Paul Simon and Sting. The band built   |\n|  up a strong word-of-mouth following in the early &amp;#039;90s by touring the      |\n|  country constantly, concentrating on college campuses. In addition to     |\n|  amassing a sizable following, their self-released album, Remember Two     |\n|  Things, sold well for an independent release; soon, they were attracting  |\n|  the attention of majors. Signing with RCA, the Dave Matthews Band         |\n|  released their major-label debut, Under the Table &amp; Dreaming, in the      |\n|  fall of 1994. By spring of 1995, the record had launched the hit single   |\n|  &quot;What Would You Say&quot; and sold over a million copies.                      |\n|                                                                            |\n|  A year-and-a-half after the release of Under the Table &amp; Dreaming, the    |\n|  record had sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. In April of   |\n|  1996, the Dave Matthews Band released Crash, which entered the charts at  |\n|  number two and quickly went platinum. Throughout 1996, the group toured   |\n|  behind Crash, sending it to double-platinum status. Also in 1996,         |\n|  Matthews launched an attack on bootleggers in conjunction with the        |\n|  Federal Government, targeting stores that were selling semi-legal discs   |\n|  of live performances. The efforts of Matthews, his band, and his          |\n|  management resulted in an unprecedented crackdown on bootleggers in       |\n|  early 1997 ? with nearly all of the major foreign bootlegging companies   |\n|  placed under arrest by the United States ? thereby putting a moratorium   |\n|  on the entire underground industry.                                       |\n|                                                                            |\n|  To further combat the bootleggers, Dave Matthews released an official,    |\n|  double-disc live album, Live at Red Rocks 8-15-95, in the fall of 1997.   |\n|  It was an unexpected success, debuting at number three on the charts and  |\n|  selling a million copies within the first five months of its release.     |\n|  The live record paved the way for the April 1998 release of Before These  |\n|  Crowded Streets, the group&amp;#039;s most ambitious album to date. Another live   |\n|  effort, Listener Supported, followed a year later. Summer tours also      |\n|  packed the late &amp;#039;90s, with sold-out shows across the U.S. The new         |\n|  millennium, however, saw the band back in the studio with Glen Ballard    |\n|  to record their fourth studio album. Everyday was issued in February      |\n|  2001. The following summer, the band issued Busted Stuff. Debut single    |\n|  &quot;Where Are You Going&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack to the Adam     |\n|  Sandler flick Mr. Deeds.                                                  |             \n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f33b5296c8eda8ee58c91a0d6e2dd2caaf5c911","amp;dn":"Dave_Matthews_Band-The_BesOf_Whats_Around-%28Advance%29-2CD-2006-FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f33b5296c8eda8ee58c91a0d6e2dd2caaf5c911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,51,181,41,108,142,218,142,229,140,145,160,214,226,221,44,170,245,201,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
