Bonus footage of four songs added for their 2008 American tour, including &quot;Ghost of a Chance,&quot; filmed here for the first time. Since the release of their eponymous first LP in 1974, Rush has continually expanded the definition of &quot;progressive power trio.&quot; Guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist / keyboardist / vocalist Geddy Lee and drummer / lyricist Neil Peart combine dazzling virtuosity, laser-beam intensity and unbridled creativity to create a cohesive whole that's infinitely greater than its parts. The Toronto-based group has become one of Canada's leading exports, with a catalog of genre-defining releases including 2112, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Vapour Trails and Snakes &amp; Arrows and a live show which combines musicianship, showmanship and multi-media effects that engage all the senses. Following their previous best-selling DVDs Rush in Rio and R30, Snakes &amp; Arrows Live presents a band not resting on its considerable laurels but still earning its reputation as one of the world's best live bands - one night at a time\n\nQuality: 720p BDRip (rip a Blu-Ray) \nContainer: MKV \nVideo Codec: x.264 \nAudio Codec: DTS \nWeight: 7.93GB (1 DVD9) \nIsxodnik: 1080p Blu-Ray \nRip video:: ryabchik \nRip Audio:: ryabchik\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3d083feb138ea33413e2fbf2b56229959996b2","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Snakes+and+Arrows+%28Live%29+-+Blu-Ray+720p+-+DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3d083feb138ea33413e2fbf2b56229959996b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,61,8,63,235,19,142,163,52,19,226,251,242,181,98,41,149,153,150,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
