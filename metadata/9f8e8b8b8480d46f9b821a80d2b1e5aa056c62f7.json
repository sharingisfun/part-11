As this is an old DOS-based game it does not work on XP. Now it does.\n\nThe setup file in this ISO has been replaced with a patch. This patch is based on the open-source project DOSbox. (http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/)\n\nInstallation:\n  o Mount or burn the file RAYMAN.ISO\n  o Press &quot;Install&quot; in the autorun menu, and follow the steps.\n  o Once done installing, you can start the game from the start menu.\n\nIf youre experiencing any problems while playing, try and have a look at the README.HTM on the cd (or just press &quot;Readme&quot; in the autorun).\n\nThis is tested and should work fine on Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f8e8b8b8480d46f9b821a80d2b1e5aa056c62f7","amp;dn":"Rayman+Original+Game+-+Works+on+XP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f8e8b8b8480d46f9b821a80d2b1e5aa056c62f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,142,139,139,132,128,212,111,155,130,26,128,210,177,229,170,5,108,98,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
