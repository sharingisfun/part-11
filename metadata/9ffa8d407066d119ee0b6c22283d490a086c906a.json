Hercules gets his strength by sniffing garlic; he wins numerous tests of strength against the bully until the bully spots him sniffing garlic. The bully pulls out a handy bottle of chlorophyll and douses the garlic, disabling Hercules. He then knocks him into a field of spinach where Hercules discovers a new and better source of strength.\n\nDivX 5.0\n720x480\n\nFor more public domain classics visit: iMovies.blogspot.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffa8d407066d119ee0b6c22283d490a086c906a","amp;dn":"Popeye+-+Greek+Mirthology+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffa8d407066d119ee0b6c22283d490a086c906a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,250,141,64,112,102,209,25,238,11,108,34,40,61,73,10,8,108,144,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
