Of course, just because Barnes evokes a certain time and place doesn't mean his hectic musical ear stays in that one place, hence the squeezebox that morphs into a battery of bagpipes on the highly cinematic opener, &quot;Laughter in the Dark.&quot; There's also room for a prideful horn that echoes the work of Ennio Morricone and the constant pitter-patter of castanets and marching snares that ensure that the solemn moments like &quot;For Slavoj&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot; don't stay that way for too long. The other notable change from the self-titled debut is the absence of digital interference. On the first album, Barnes threw his vintage sounds into a modern wormhole with much sampler stutter. On Darkness at Noon, he keeps the computerization well in the back, invisible to the ears. Or perhaps the ten-deep list of musicians on the CD sleeve means it was a full battalion of players tapping, blowing, squeezing, and strumming away all at once. Imagine that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a075cd153349edea9b8eee2fee507a601c7737a2","amp;dn":"A+Hawk+and+a+Hacksaw+-+Darkness+At+Noon+%5B2005%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a075cd153349edea9b8eee2fee507a601c7737a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,117,205,21,51,73,237,234,155,142,238,47,238,80,122,96,28,119,55,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
