It reveals a multi-faceted textual - rather than more traditionally-defined 'literary' - world that both defines the intellectual life of the late Republic, and lays the foundations for those authors of the Principate and Empire who identified this period as their literary source and inspiration. By first questioning, and then rejecting, the traditional polarisation of Catullus and Cicero, and by broadening the scope of late Republican socio-literary studies to include intersections of language, social practice, and textual materiality, this book presents a fresh picture of both the socio-textual world of the late Republic and the primary authors through whom this world would gain renown.\n\n# Hardcover: 322 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 7, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521513901\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521513906","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0779b93752ccbd626f723de9360014183c33267","amp;dn":"Catullus%2C+Cicero%2C+and+a+Society+of+Patrons+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0779b93752ccbd626f723de9360014183c33267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,119,155,147,117,44,203,214,38,247,35,222,147,96,1,65,131,195,50,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
