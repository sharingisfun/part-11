These Days\n\n  Retreating from the hazy Danger Mouse-fueled pot dream of Attack &amp; Release, the Black Keys headed down to the legendary Muscle Shoals, recording their third album on their own and dubbing it Brothers. The studio, not to mention the artwork patterned after such disregarded Chess psychedelic-era relics as This Is HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Album, are good indications that the tough blues band of the Black Keys earliest records is back, but the group hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forgotten what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned in their inwardly psychedelic mid-period. Brothers still can get mighty trippy -- the swirling chintzy organ that circles Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Only One,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Baroque harpsichord flair of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Afraid to Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- but the album is built with blood and dirt, so its wilder moments remain gritty without being earthbound. Sonically, that scuffed-up spaciness -- the open air created by the fuzz guitars and phasing, analog keyboards, and cavernous drums -- is considerably appealing, but the Black Keys' ace in the hole remains the exceptional songwriting that Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney are so good at. They twist a Gary Glitter stomp into swamp fuzz blues, steal a title from Archie Bell &amp; the Drells but never reference that classic Tighten Up groove, and approximate a slow Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s soul crawl on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unknown BrotherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ before following it up with a version of Jerry ButlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Gonna Give You Up,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly impossible to tell which is the cover. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the great thing about the Black Keys in general and Brothers in particular: the past and present intermingle so thoroughly that they blur, yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no affect, just three hundred pounds of joy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0828b4ff228abb1aae9207ef0b05d5482368ad8","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Brothers+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0828b4ff228abb1aae9207ef0b05d5482368ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,130,139,79,242,40,171,177,170,233,32,126,240,176,93,84,130,54,138,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
