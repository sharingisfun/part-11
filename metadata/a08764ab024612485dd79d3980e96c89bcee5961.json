Written by the leading researchers in the field of image and video super-resolution, it surveys the latest state-of-the-art techniques in super-resolution imaging. Each detailed chapter provides coverage of the implementations and applications of super-resolution imaging. Its 14 sections span a wide range of modern super-resolution imaging techniques and includes variational, Bayesian, feature-based, multi-channel, learning-based, locally adaptive, and nonparametric methods. It discusses, among others, medical, military, and remote-sensing applications. The book can be used as a reference, a basis for short-courses on the subject, or as part of a graduate course on digital image processing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08764ab024612485dd79d3980e96c89bcee5961","amp;dn":"Super-Resolution+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08764ab024612485dd79d3980e96c89bcee5961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,135,100,171,2,70,18,72,93,215,157,57,128,233,108,137,188,238,89,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
