There are some introspective moments for the guitarist (who plays strictly electric here) but DeFrancesco dominates the ensembles and takes the lion's share of the solo space.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Nite Stand\n02 - Hijacked\n03 - When Love Is Far Away\n04 - Little Miss Valley\n05 - Juju At The Crossroads\n06 - Vukovar\n07 - No Blues\n08 - Mattinale\n\n\n*1993 Verve / Polydor / PolyGram | 314 521 870-2\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn McLaughlin - guitar\nJoey DeFrancesco - Hammond XB-3 organ and trumpet\nDennis Chambers - drums\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
