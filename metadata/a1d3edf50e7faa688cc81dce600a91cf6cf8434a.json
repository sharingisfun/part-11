Along the way youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the fundamentals of how stereoscopy works and how After Effects creates the illusion of depth in a moving image. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also see how to combine 2D tracking and some basic 3D animation to create a 3D tracking effect, and how to work with effects, transparency, and styles. After completing this workshop youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll understand the complete workflow involved in creating stereo 3D, from setting up a stereo 3D rig, to compositing footage and adjusting settings, to adding finishing touches like depth of field and motion blur.\n\nTrainer: Angie Taylor\nPublication date: Aug 24, 2011\nPrice: $29.99 \nDuration: 1 hr\n\nMore info: http://www.video2brain.com/en/courses/stereoscopic-3d-motion-graphics-workshop\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d3edf50e7faa688cc81dce600a91cf6cf8434a","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Stereoscopic+3D+Motion+Graphics+Workshop+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d3edf50e7faa688cc81dce600a91cf6cf8434a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,211,237,245,14,127,170,104,140,200,29,206,96,10,145,207,108,248,67,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
