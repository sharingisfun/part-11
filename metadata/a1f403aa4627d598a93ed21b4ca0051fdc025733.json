Released on October 17, 2011, it was the band's first album to feature vocalist Stu Block, who joined after previous vocalist Matt Barlow left the band. Dystopia was also the last Iced Earth studio album to feature bassist Freddie Vidales and drummer Brent Smedley.\n\nThe album was recorded during the summer of 2011 at Morrisound Recording, with co-producer Jim Morris. While not a concept album, many of the album's songs are inspired by dystopian themes and films, very much like the group's 2001 album Horror Show, which was largely inspired by horror films and other similar subjects. Two songs off of Dystopia (the title track and &quot;Tragedy and Triumph&quot;) feature the return of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer's Something Wicked concept, which has appeared on many of the band's previous albums.\nDuring its first week, the album sold over 6,000 copies in the United States and charted in eight countries, including Germany, Finland and the UK.The album was met with a very positive response, with some critics calling it one of Iced Earth's best albums. Many also praised Stu Block's performance and wide vocal range. Dystopia was followed by an extensive world tour which included dates in countries that Iced Earth had never played before, including Cyprus, China and Australia.Dystopia World Tour\nMain article: Dystopia World Tour\n\nThe album was followed by an extensive world tour, which started on October 30, 2011 in Bochum, Germany. Prior to the album's release, the tour was named &quot;the most extensive world tour Iced Earth has ever undertaken&quot; and that it would take the band &quot;to countries it has never previously played&quot;. The tour featured a total of 133 dates. Iced Earth also recorded a live CD/DVD on August 19, 2012 in Cyprus.\n\nOn October 31, 2011, Iced Earth announced a co-headlining tour across North America with Symphony X. On April 18, 2012, it was announced that Iced Earth (along with Hellyeah) would be supporting Volbeat on their North American tour, starting June 18, 2012. Hellyeah supporting Volbeat? Please shoot me.It should be the opposite way. \n\nOn the first European leg of the Dystopia World Tour, Iced Earth was supported by Fury UK and White Wizzard. During the tour's first North American leg, Iced Earth was supported by Warbringer. Evergrey, Steel Engraved and Deadshape Figure supported Iced Earth during the third and final European leg.Metal-rules.com placed Dystopia at number 2 on their &quot;Top 20 Metal Albums of 2011&quot; list.\nTrack listing\nRegular edition[48] \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Dystopia&quot;   \tStu Block, Jon Schaffer \tSchaffer \t5:49\n2. \t&quot;Anthem&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t4:54\n3. \t&quot;Boiling Point&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t2:46\n4. \t&quot;Anguish of Youth&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \t4:41\n5. \t&quot;V&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer, Troy Seele \t3:39\n6. \t&quot;Dark City&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t5:42\n7. \t&quot;Equilibrium&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t4:30\n8. \t&quot;Days of Rage&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \t2:17\n9. \t&quot;End of Innocence&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t4:07\n10. \t&quot;Tragedy and Triumph&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t7:44\nTotal length:\n\t45:05 \t\nDownloadable bonus track (included in Japanese Edition and various retail versions) \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n11. \t&quot;The Trooper&quot; (Iron Maiden cover) \tSteve Harris \tHarris \t4:19\niTunes bonus track \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n11. \t&quot;The Mob Rules&quot; (Black Sabbath cover) \tRonnie James Dio \tGeezer Butler, Dio, Tony Iommi \t3:08\nLimited edition \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Dystopia&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t5:49\n2. \t&quot;Anthem&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t4:54\n3. \t&quot;Boiling Point&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t2:46\n4. \t&quot;Anguish of Youth&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \t4:41\n5. \t&quot;V&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer, Seele \t3:39\n6. \t&quot;Dark City&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t5:42\n7. \t&quot;Equilibrium&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t4:30\n8. \t&quot;Days of Rage&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \t2:17\n9. \t&quot;End of Innocence&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer \t4:07\n10. \t&quot;Soylent Green&quot;   \tBlock \tSchaffer, Seele \t4:20\n11. \t&quot;Iron Will&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t4:15\n12. \t&quot;Tragedy and Triumph&quot;   \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t8:23\n13. \t&quot;Anthem&quot; (String Mix) \tBlock, Schaffer \tSchaffer \t4:54\nPersonnel\nIced Earth\n\n    Jon Schaffer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, lead guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals, co-producer[49]\n    Stu Block Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals[49]\n    Troy Seele Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar[49]\n    Freddie Vidales Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    Brent Smedley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums                           ......................................Seed this for life, of torrent that is........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f403aa4627d598a93ed21b4ca0051fdc025733","amp;dn":"Iced+Earth+Dystopia+%28Ultimate+Edition%29++mp3+320k+a2k+++2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f403aa4627d598a93ed21b4ca0051fdc025733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,244,3,170,70,39,213,152,169,62,210,27,76,160,5,31,220,2,87,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
