This long-awaited fourth edition maintains the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cookbook&quot; features and Excel dependence that have made the previous editions so popular. As in previous editions, basic and advanced models in the areas of corporate finance, portfolio management, options, and bonds are explained with detailed Excel spreadsheets. Sections on technical aspects of Excel and on the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) round out the book to make Financial Modeling a complete guide for the financial modeler.\n\nThe new edition of Financial Modeling includes a number of innovations. A new section explains the principles of Monte Carlo methods and their application to portfolio management and exotic option valuation. A new chapter discusses term structure modeling, with special emphasis on the Nelson-Siegel model. The discussion of corporate valuation using pro forma models has been rounded out with the introduction of a new, simple model for corporate valuation based on accounting data and a minimal number of valuation parameters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a207673b2574dac1732d239e8efe2d81f8bcd846","amp;dn":"Financial+Modelling+-+Simon+Benninga+%284th+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a207673b2574dac1732d239e8efe2d81f8bcd846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,7,103,59,37,116,218,193,115,45,35,158,142,254,45,129,248,188,216,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
