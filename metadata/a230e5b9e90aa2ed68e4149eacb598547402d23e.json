It is the year 2035. Almost 20 years ago citizens of The Republic had to seek shelter for the hell of the Third World War. However, only a few were lucky enough to find a place for them in the prepared shelters. Over time, the fear of death on the surface became just a bad memory. However, the seemingly safe hideout has turned into a curse from which there is no escape. It was only a matter of time before someone else could not, and thus the dream of safety becomes a nightmare prison. Albert Tokaj, the protagonist of Afterfall: Insanity, a member of the medical team caring for the mental and physical health Shelter citizens. Specializes in mental disorder that is caused by being locked up for a long time, and he is not free from suffering symptoms. When Hell begins to unravel, Albert has to find answers to many questions, when and why, who is the real enemy and who a loyal friend. Albert will have to face the dangers lurking in the den and in his own mind, battling his own weakness and their own fears\n\n\n________________$$$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n__________$$$$$$____$$$$$$\n________$$____$$____$$____$$$$\n________$$____$$____$$____$$__$$\n$$$$$$__$$____$$____$$____$$____$$\n$$____$$$$________________$$____$$\n$$______$$______________________$$\n__$$____$$______________________$$\n___$$$__$$______________________$$\n____$$__________________________$$\n_____$$$________________________$$\n______$$______________________$$$\n_______$$$____________________$$\n________$$____________________$$\n_________$$$________________$$$\n__________$$________________$$\n__________$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a230e5b9e90aa2ed68e4149eacb598547402d23e","amp;dn":"Afterfall+Insanity+Extended+Edition+%5BMULTI%5D+%5BIncl+2+%26amp%3B+DLC%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a230e5b9e90aa2ed68e4149eacb598547402d23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,48,229,185,233,10,162,237,104,228,20,158,172,181,152,84,116,2,210,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
