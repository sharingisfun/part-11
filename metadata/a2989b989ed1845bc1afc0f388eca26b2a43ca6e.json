In his new book, Operation Mincemeat, he tells an extraordinary story that will delight his legions of fans.\n\nIn 1943, from a windowless basement office in London, two brilliant intelligence officers conceived a plan that was both simple and complicatedÃ¢â‚¬â€ Operation Mincemeat. The purpose? To deceive the Nazis into thinking that Allied forces were planning to attack southern Europe by way of Greece or Sardinia, rather than Sicily, as the Nazis had assumed, and the Allies ultimately chose.\n \nCharles Cholmondeley of MI5 and the British naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu could not have been more different. Cholmondeley was a dreamer seeking adventure. Montagu was an aristocratic, detail-oriented barrister. But together they were the perfect team and created an ingenious plan: Get a corpse, equip it with secret (but false and misleading) papers concerning the invasion, then drop it off the coast of Spain where German spies would, they hoped, take the bait. The idea was approved by British intelligence officials, including Ian Fleming (creator of James Bond). Winston Churchill believed it might ring true to the Axis and help bring victory to the Allies.\n\nFilled with spies, double agents, rogues, fearless heroes, and one very important corpse, the story of Operation Mincemeat reads like an international thriller.\n\nUnveiling never-before-released material, Ben Macintyre brings the reader right into the minds of intelligence officers, their moles and spies, and the German Abwehr agents who suffered the Ã¢â‚¬Å“twin frailties of wishfulness and yesmanship.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He weaves together the eccentric personalities of Cholmondeley and Montagu and their near-impossible feats into a riveting adventure that not only saved thousands of lives but paved the way for a pivotal battle in Sicily and, ultimately, Allied success in the war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2989b989ed1845bc1afc0f388eca26b2a43ca6e","amp;dn":"Operation+Mincemeat%3A+How+a+Dead+Man+and+a+Bizarre+Plan+Fooled+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2989b989ed1845bc1afc0f388eca26b2a43ca6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,152,155,152,158,209,132,91,193,175,192,243,136,236,162,107,42,67,202,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
