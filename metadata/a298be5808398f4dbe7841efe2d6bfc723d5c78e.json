With more than two decades of experience in professional software production, Lauren is a recognized authority in enterprise architecture and the development of commercial-grade mobile applications. Lauren received a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\n \n\nShe spends her copious free time traveling the world with her geeky mobile-minded husband and is an avid nature photographer. Her work has been published in books and newspapers around the world. In South Africa, she dove with 4-meter-long great white sharks and got stuck between a herd of rampaging hippopotami and an irritated bull elephant. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been attacked by monkeys in Japan, gotten stuck in a ravine with two hungry lions in Kenya, gotten thirsty in Egypt, narrowly avoided a coup dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tat in Thailand, geocached her way through the Swiss Alps, drank her way through the beer halls of Germany, slept in the crumbling castles of Europe, and gotten her tongue stuck to an iceberg in Iceland (while being watched by a herd of suspicious wild reindeer).\n\n \n\nShane Conder has extensive development experience and has focused his attention on mobile and embedded development for the past decade. He has designed and developed many commercial applications for BREW, J2ME, Palm, Windows Mobile, and Android--some of which have been installed on millions of phones worldwide. Shane has written extensively about the mobile industry and evaluated mobile development platforms on his tech blogs and is well known within the blogosphere. Shane received a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of California.\n\n \n\nA self-admitted gadget freak, Shane always has the latest phone or laptop. He can often be found fiddling with the latest technologies, such as Amazon Web Services, Android, iPhone, Google App Engine, and other exciting, state-of-the-art technologies that activate the creative part of his brain. He also enjoys traveling the world with his geeky wife, even if she did make him dive with 4-meter-long great white sharks and almost get eaten by a lion in Kenya. He admits that it was his fault they got attacked by monkeys in Japan, that he snickered and whipped out his Android phone to take a picture when Laurie got her tongue stuck to that iceberg in Iceland, and that he still hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t learned his lesson about writing his own bio.\n\n \n\nOther Publications by the Authors\n\nThe authors have also published Android Wireless Application Development, part of the Addison-Wesley DeveloperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Library series, as well as numerous online technical articles for http://developer.com, http://informIT.com, and their own Android blog,\nProduct Details\n\n    Series: Sams Teach Yourself\n    Paperback: 480 pages\n    Publisher: Sams Publishing; 1 edition (June 20, 2010)\n    Language: English\n    ISBN-10: 0321673352\n    ISBN-13: 978-0321673350\n\nCustomer Review Rating - 3.3 out of 5 stars\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“\nAfter going through this book (in more than 24 hours) I really started to get a feel the book was rushed.  Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMatthew Keefe| 26 reviewers made a similar statement\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“\nThis is a good book for the beginning Android developer who already has experience developing in Java.  Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nE Noordhuizen| 17 reviewers made a similar statement\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“\nFrom my point of view I found the book to be very well done.
