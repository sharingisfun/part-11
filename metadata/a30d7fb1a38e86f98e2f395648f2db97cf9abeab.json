She bonds with a starfish-shaped \\&quot;dragonchild\\&quot; (baby \\&quot;shadow dragon\\&quot;) whom she calls Hoshimaru. The series is mainly about the interaction between Shiina and other young people who have also bonded with dragons.\nThe manga, especially the original Japanese versions, contains gruesome material and images particularly towards its later volumes. Despite the young main characters, cute aliens, and initial look of a shÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½jo or magical girl series, the story quickly transforms into one filled with very graphic sexual and violent themes.\n\nOne should note that this manga is quite a serious work and although it has some elements of violence it doesn\\&amp;#039;t glamorize it in any way. It deals mostly with ethical and psychological issues.\n\nSince Dark Horse, Shadow Star\\&amp;#039;s US publisher, decided to split first 4 volumes of Narutaru to 5 Shadow Star TPB volumes, there has been some confusion. Especially since Dark Horse stopped publishing Shadow Star TPB\\&amp;#039;s after 7th one, but continued printing it in Super Manga Blast anthology magazine for over 2 volumes worth of material.\n\nTo clear all this mess up, here is a \\&quot;comparision chart\\&quot; of the volumes:\n\n1: Starflight // Chapters 1-4 (Japanese 1-5)\n2: Darkness Visible // Chapters 5-10 (Japanese 6-13)\n3: Shadows Of The Past // Chapters 11-15 (Japanese 14-20)\n4: Nothing But The Truth // Chapters 16-20 (Japanese 21-23)\n5: A Flower\\&amp;#039;s Fragrance // Chapters 21-23 (Japanese 24-28)\n6: What Can I Do For You Now? // Chapters 24-28 (Japanese 29)\n7: Victim\\&amp;#039;s Eyes, Assailant\\&amp;#039;s Hands // Chapter 29 (Japanese 30-38)\n8: Japanese 39-44 \n9: Japanese 45-48\n10: Japanese 49 &amp; 50\n11: Japanese 51-61\n12: Japanese 62-68\n\nFinally, thanks to manga-sketchbook team we have it here.
