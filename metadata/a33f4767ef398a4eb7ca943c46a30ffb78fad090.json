This volume is the first attempt of its kind to familiarise readers in the US, UK, Australia and the English speaking regions of Africa and Asia with such evolutionary thinking. In such a manner, also, it will be possible to discern, contextualize and better appreciate the European roots of subsequent theorising in the Anglophone world, thereby enabling a more accurate assessment of its hitherto unchallenged claims to originality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a33f4767ef398a4eb7ca943c46a30ffb78fad090","amp;dn":"The+Sociology+of+Tourism+-+European+Origins+and+Developments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a33f4767ef398a4eb7ca943c46a30ffb78fad090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,63,71,103,239,57,138,78,183,202,148,60,70,163,15,251,120,250,208,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
