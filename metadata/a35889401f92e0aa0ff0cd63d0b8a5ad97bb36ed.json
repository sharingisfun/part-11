I am uploading Linux edition a little differently.. This is the .RPM and .DEB editions\n\nI also uploaded the .TAR.GZ edition... x-x But was an idiot who shouldn't be uploading torrents after just having eaten Thanksgiving dinner and while fighting the after dinner food coma...(I mislabeled the Tar.GZ edition as 1.4.4 x-x) \n\n so... if you know how to use TAR.GZ   GRATZ! You get a smaller download from the other torrent, if you don't know how and prefer to get the .DEB or .RPM ... You're in the right spot but will take a bit longer to download!\n\n(Note this is 479mb compared to the .TAR.GZ 240mb!   so if you know how to use .TAR.GZ you benefit from slightly quicker time!)\n\nNow then.. on with game description\n\n&quot;Welcome to Game Dev Tycoon, this game was created by Greenheart Games, which was founded with an agenda to make 'fun to play instead of mind numbing money grabbers.
