Its unique &quot;AutoStop&quot; feature will stop an application when you switch away from it, and then automatically restart it when you click back to it.\n\nApp Tamer includes an attractive and clear user interface for managing your running applications. It shows the average percentage of your processor(s) being used by each app, and graphically displays a history of CPU usage. You can easily enable AutoStop for any application, as well as change its processing priority in OS X.\n\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 1.3.1\n\n* The &quot;AutoStop only when on battery&quot; setting is now more logical, and has been renamed &quot;Don't AutoStop when plugged in and battery is above xx%&quot;.\n* Added the ability to detect downloads in uTorrent 1.7.4 when its &quot;Append !ut extension to incomplete files&quot; setting is turned on.\n* App Tamer's modal dialogs no longer lock out its AutoStop stop/start handling.\nRequirements\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later \n\nThanks TOBW^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3671d73bfbf33cea216087326bf8d37a5abd788","amp;dn":"App+Tamer+1.3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3671d73bfbf33cea216087326bf8d37a5abd788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,103,29,115,191,191,51,206,162,22,8,115,38,191,141,55,165,171,215,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
