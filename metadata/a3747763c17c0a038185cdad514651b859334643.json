Yaws (WA, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nCarl Yaws, a leading authority on chemical compounds in the chemical engineering field, has done it again. In Transport Properties of Chemicals and Hydrocarbons -- an essential volume for any chemist or chemical engineerâ€™s library -- he has amassed over 7,800 organic and inorganic chemicals, and hydrocarbons. Spanning gases, liquids and solids, and covering all critical properties (including viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion coefficient), this volume represents more properties on more chemicals than any single work of its kind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3747763c17c0a038185cdad514651b859334643","amp;dn":"Transport+Properties+of+Chemicals+and+Hydrocarbons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3747763c17c0a038185cdad514651b859334643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,116,119,99,193,124,10,3,129,133,205,173,81,70,81,184,89,51,70,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
