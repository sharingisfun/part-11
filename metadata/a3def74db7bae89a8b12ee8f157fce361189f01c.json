Starting with an overview of the IPv6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Internet of ThingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, readers are offered an insight into how these technologies fit together into a complete architecture. The 6LoWPAN format and related standards are then covered in detail. In addition, the authors discuss the building and operation of 6LoWPAN networks, including bootstrapping, routing, security, Internet ingration, mobility and application protocols. Furthermore, implementation aspects of 6LoWPAN are covered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3def74db7bae89a8b12ee8f157fce361189f01c","amp;dn":"6LoWPAN+The+Wireless+Embedded+Internet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3def74db7bae89a8b12ee8f157fce361189f01c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,222,247,77,183,186,232,154,139,18,238,143,21,127,206,54,17,137,240,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
