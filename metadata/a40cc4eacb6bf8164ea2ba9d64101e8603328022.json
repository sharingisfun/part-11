The brutal Vic cuts the throat of one bloke who has been a little too loose-lipped, afraid that his gossiping may turn into a grand operatic performance for the coppers. Vic, who enjoys playing at rough trade with his sidekick Wolfe, plans a payroll robbery and directs the blackmailing of Members of Parliament with a taste for unorthodox sex. Scotland Yard Police Inspector Matthews, playing Javert to Vic's Jean Valjean, is moving in on him and the gang. Gang-member Frank is hospitalized for an ulcer, and Inspector Matthews might be able to make him sing. Will Frank spill the beans to the coppers before Vic can silence him?\n\nRichard Burton\nIan McShane\nJoss Ackland\n\nA forgotten masterpiece\n\nIMDB: http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0067952/\n\nNot great quality, ripped from a very old VHS tape, but very watchable\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40cc4eacb6bf8164ea2ba9d64101e8603328022","amp;dn":"Villain.+Richard+Burton.+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40cc4eacb6bf8164ea2ba9d64101e8603328022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,12,196,234,203,107,248,22,78,162,186,157,100,16,30,134,3,50,128,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
