Faticoni, &quot;The Mathematics of Infinity: A Guide to Great Ideas&quot;\nEnglish | 2006 | ISBN: 0471794325 | PDF | 287 pages | 7 MB\n\nA balanced and clearly explained treatment of infinity in mathematics.\n\nThe concept of infinity has fascinated and confused mankind for centuries with concepts and ideas that cause even seasoned mathematicians to wonder. For instance, the idea that a set is infinite if it is not a finite set is an elementary concept that jolts our common sense and imagination. the Mathematics of Infinity: A guide to Great Ideas uniquely explores how we can manipulate these ideas when our common sense rebels at the conclusions we are drawing.\n\nWriting with clear knowledge and affection for the subject, the author introduces and explores infinite sets, infinite cardinals, and ordinals, thus challenging the readers' intuitive beliefs about infinity. Requiring little mathematical training and a healthy curiosity, the book presents a user-friendly approach to ideas involving the infinite. readers will discover the main ideas of infinite cardinals and ordinal numbers without experiencing in-depth mathematical rigor. Classic arguments and illustrative examples are provided throughout the book and are accompanied by a gradual progression of sophisticated notions designed to stun your intuitive view of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40f7d47c952b149d6e1c88306bcf00f4c35bf40","amp;dn":"The+Mathematics+of+Infinity%3A+A+Guide+to+Great+Ideas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40f7d47c952b149d6e1c88306bcf00f4c35bf40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,15,125,71,201,82,177,73,214,225,200,131,6,188,240,15,76,53,191,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
