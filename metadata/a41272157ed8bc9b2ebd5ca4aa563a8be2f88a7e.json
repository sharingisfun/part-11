Also on hand are The Blasters, Maria McKee, and Ry \nCooder. The album's hit single turned out to be Dan Hartman's &quot;I Can Dream about \nYou.&quot; \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              SOME WIKIPEDIA INFO\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJimmy Iovine produced five of the songs for the film and the soundtrack album.\n[2] For Ellen Aim's singing voice, he combined the voices of Laurie Sargent and \nHolly Sherwood. The Attackers were the real-life (Face to Face) bandmates of \nSargent, who provided the lead vocals on Ellen Aim's songs &quot;Never Be You&quot; and \n&quot;Sorcerer&quot; and supporting vocals on &quot;Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young.&quot;[2] \nThe version of 'Sorcerer' on the actual soundtrack album was performed by \nMarilyn Martin (written by Stevie Nicks).\n\nTwo Wagnerian rock songs written by Jim Steinman were part of the soundtrack: \n&quot;Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Fast,&quot; both performed by \nFire Inc. with Holly Sherwood as lead vocal. The title of the former was used as \nthe tagline on some promotional materials for the film.[2] Dan Hartman's &quot;I Can \nDream About You&quot; is the most successful song from this movie and became a \nBillboard top 10 hit in 1984. In the movie, the song is performed by &quot;the \nSorels,&quot; a fictional doo-wop style group consisting of actors Stoney Jackson, \nGrand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, and Robert Townsend.[2] However, the song was \nactually sung by Winston Ford, whose vocals were convincingly lip-synced by \nStoney Jackson in the movie. There are thus two versions of the song, but the \nmost popular was sung by Dan Hartman for commercial release.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  THE LYRICS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the first pressings (on vinyl), the album contained a leaf with the lyrics \nfor all songs.  Call me old-fashioned vinylmaniac, but I want to add them here.\n\n\nFIRE INC. - NOWHERE FAST\n\nLying in your bed and on a Saturday night\nYou're sweatin' buckets and it's not even hot\nBut your brain has got the message\nAnd it's sending it out\nTo every nerve and every muscle you've got\n\nYou've got so many dreams\nThat you don't know where to put 'em\nSo you'd better turn a few of 'em loose\nYour body's got a feeling that it's starting to rust\nYou'd better rev it up and put it to use\n\nAnd I don't know how I ever thought that I could make it all alone\nWhen you only make it better\nAnd it better be tonight\nAnd we'll fly away on those angel wings of chrome in your daddy's car\nWaiting there for you tonight\nI'll be there for you tonight\n\nEven if you don't have anywhere to go\nYou go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll\nAnd even if you don't have anywhere to go\nYou go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll\nAnd your speed\nIs all you'll ever need\nAll you'll ever need to know\nDarlin', Darlin'-\n\nYou and me we're goin' nowhere slowly\nAnd we've gotta get away from the past\nThere's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby\nBut we should be goin' nowhere fast\n\nEverybody's goin' nowhere slowly\nThey're only fighting for the chance to be last\nThere's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby\nBut we should be goin' nowhere fast\nIt's so much better goin' nowhere fast\n\nAh...\n\nStalkin' in the shadows by the light of the moon\nIt's like a prison and the night is a cell\nGoin' anywhere has gotta be heaven tonight\n'Cause stayin' here has gotta be hell\nDyin' in the city like a fire on the water\nLet's go runnin' on the back of the wind\nThere's gotta be some action on the face of the earth\nAnd I've gotta see your face once again\n\nAnd I don't know where I ever got the bright idea that I was cool\nSo alone and independent\nBut I'm depending on you now\nAnd you'll always be the only thing that I just can't be without\nAnd I'm out for you tonight\nI'm comin' out for you tonight\n\nEven if you don't have anywhere to go\nYou go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll (ready to roll)\nEven if you don't have anywhere to go\nYou go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll\nAnd your speed\nIs all you'll ever need\nAll you'll ever need to know\nDarlin', Darlin'-\n\nYou and me we're goin' nowhere slowly\nAnd we've gotta get away from the past\nThere's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby\nBut we should be goin' nowhere fast\n\nEverybody's goin' nowhere slowly\nThey're only fighting for the chance to be last\nThere's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby\nBut we should be goin' nowhere fast\nIt's so much better goin' nowhere fast\n\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nSpeed us away!\n\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nSpeed us away!\n\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nGodspeed\nSpeed us away!\n\n(We're goin' nowhere fast!)\n\n(Ah...)\n\n\n\nMARILYN MARTIN - SORCERER\n\nI'm tired\nI'm thirsty\nI'm wild eyed\nIn my misery\nTimeless\nIn your finery\nA high price\nFor your luxury\n\n(Chorus)\nSorcerer\nWho is the master\nMan and woman on a star stream\nIn the middle of a snow dream\nSorcerer\nShow me the high life\nCome over\nLet me put you on ice\n\nI'm tired\nWhen I need you badly\nWild eyed\nIn the middle of your dream\nTimeless\nIt's a mystery\nAll they way\nNow it's never what you are\n\nAll around\nBlack ink darkness\nWho found\nThe lady from the mountain\n\nI'm tired\nI'm thirsty\nI'm wild eyed\nIn my mystery\nTimeless\nIn your finery\nA high price\nFor your luxury\n\n(Repeat chorus) \n\n\n\nTHE FIXX - DEEPER AND DEEPER\n\nTalking about stealing the show no one would know\nTalking about stealing the show when they're all letting go\nTake a look at the witch see the twitch in her eye tell me what did she feel\nIs this the way of the world take a boy and a girl show them lying is real\n\n(Chorus)\nThen I see the edge I look I fall\nAnd I get deeper and deeper\nThe more I see the more I fall no place to hide\nYou better take the call\nI get deeper and deeper\n\nWas it the smell of the oil the sweat and the toil that made living unreal\nWas it the man in the suit or the boy with the flute tell me what did he steal\nIs it beginning to break can you see the mistake there'll be nowhere to go\nOnce in a fool's blood in the wrong neighborhood what price did he pay\n\n(Chorus)\n\nSo make you see what I mean tell me what do I say\nHire your voice freedom of choice what do you say\nSo I'm talking about stealin' the show no one would know\nOh I'm talking about stealing the show when they're all letting go\n\n(Chorus)\n\nI see the edge I look I fall\nNo place to hide I better take the call\n(repeat)\n\n\n\nGREG PHILINGANES -

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41272157ed8bc9b2ebd5ca4aa563a8be2f88a7e","amp;dn":"Soundtrack+-+Streets+Of+Fire+A+Rock+%26+Roll+Fable+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BReP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41272157ed8bc9b2ebd5ca4aa563a8be2f88a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,18,114,21,126,216,188,155,46,189,92,164,170,86,58,139,226,248,138,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
