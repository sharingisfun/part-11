Two bonus tracks from their later albums are also included on this disc, 'I L-O-V-E U' and 'So Cool.' I have used DVD-Audio Explorer to rip the tracks from the DVD-A and FLAC frontend v1.7.1 to losslessly compress the tracks. There are two versions, the 96kHz/24bit 5.1 surround sound and the 96kHz/24bit stereo downmix from the DVD-A ('get stereo downmix' option on DVD-Audio Explorer). Booklet scans included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41cd16b14fadd2126c7feaf3185d4335a4d6d90","amp;dn":"Take+6+%28DVDA%29%5BFLAC%2BSCANS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41cd16b14fadd2126c7feaf3185d4335a4d6d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,28,209,107,20,250,221,33,38,199,254,175,49,133,212,51,90,77,109,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
