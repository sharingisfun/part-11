GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­sladÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ttir, Valdimar ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rn Flygenring and introducing Geirlaug Sunna ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ormar. It was written and directed by Nietzchka Keene and based on the fairy tale &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot; collected by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nThe film was shot in Iceland with an extraordinary small budget in the summer of 1986, but because of financial problems later on in the editing room it was not released until 1990. Rhino Home Video released the film on VHS in 1995 and on DVD in 2002.\n\nThe Juniper Tree is set in Iceland and portrays the story of two sisters, Margit (BjÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rk GuÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°mundsdÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ttir) and her elder sister Katla (Bryndis Petra BragadÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ttir), who escape their home after their mother (GuÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°rÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âºn S. GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­sladÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ttir) is stoned and burned for witchcraft. They go where no one knows them, and find JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³hann (Valdimar ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rn Flygenring), a young widower who has a son called JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³nas (Geirlaug Sunna ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ormar). Katla uses magical powers to seduce JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³hann and they start living together. Margit and JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³nas become friends. However, JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³nas does not accept Katla as his stepmother and tries to convince his father to leave her. Katla's magic power is too strong and even though he knows he should leave her, he can't. Margit's mother appears to her in visions and JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³nas' mother appears as a raven and to bring him a magical feather.\n\n\n\nPlease note that this is a slowpaced lowbudget film. The actors speak English with an accent. It is shot in black&amp;white and probably only interesting for moviefreaks and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rkfans. (She does sing a bit in this movie)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44206773ff95417d357aca2532855a5a555dcda","amp;dn":"The.Juniper.Tree.1990.DVDRip.reyn.avi+%28with+Bj%C3%83%C2%B6rk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44206773ff95417d357aca2532855a5a555dcda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,66,6,119,63,249,84,23,211,87,172,162,83,40,85,165,165,85,220,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
