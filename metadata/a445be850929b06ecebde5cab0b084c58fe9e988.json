But he finds no usual motive when investigating the beating death of a man.  The man was killed because he was a Jew.  &quot;Hate,:  Finlay says, &quot;Is like a gun.&quot;\n\nRobert Young portrays Finlay, Robert Mitchum is a laconic army sergeant assisting in the investigation of GI suspects and Robert Ryan plays a vicious bigot in a landmark film noir nominated for five Academy Awards.  Including Best Picture.  Edward Dymytryk (Murder My Sweet) directs, draping the genre's stylistic backdrops and flourishes around a topic rarely before explored in films: anti Semitism in the U.S.  Here, Hollywood took aim at injustiuce... and caught bigotry in a &quot;Crossfire.&quot;\n\nThis torrent also includes the Featurette on the film called &quot;Hate is like a gun.&quot;\n\nThe featurette notes that Robert Ryan who portrays the bigot in this film was one of the most tolerant men in Hollywood.  His last performance was in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; by Eugene O'Neill for the American Film Theater which is also available on torrents.\n\n\n\nNotes written January 3rd, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a445be850929b06ecebde5cab0b084c58fe9e988","amp;dn":"Crossfire+%281947%29+directed+by+Edward+Dmytryk+includes+Feaurette+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a445be850929b06ecebde5cab0b084c58fe9e988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,69,190,133,9,41,176,110,206,189,229,202,176,176,132,197,143,233,233,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
