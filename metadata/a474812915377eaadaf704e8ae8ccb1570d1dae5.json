Why is our response so contradictory and why is nudity treated so differently in different contexts? Drawing on popular culture, literature, philosophy, religion, and firsthand interviews in order to answer these questions, Barcan encounters morticians, nudists, strippers, nurses, tattooists, artists and pornographers. Shining a light on a topic that has been largely ignored despite its ability to titillate, shock and entertain, Nudity is a fascinating blend of meaningful minutiae and big philosophical questions about this most unnatural state of nature.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;I've met a lot of folks that think a lot about nudity, but none understand it as well as Ruth Barcan. [This book] is...fascinating...the first of its kind. It goes deep inside nudity, picks it apart, and shines light on its complexitites. I was amazed.&quot; -Annie Sprinkle, Nude Performer turned Sexologist\n\n&quot;Ruth Barcan's brilliant study of the social meanings of nudity is at once learned, witty, and incisive. To be nude is never to be naked: this book ranges broadly across philosophy, religion, literature and popular culture to tell us why, in a lucid analysis of our divided and complex status as human beings.&quot; -John Frow, University of Edinburgh\n\nThis torrent contains a fully indexed, browse-able and searchable copy of the book in PDF format.
