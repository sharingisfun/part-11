London's Rose (4:50)\n\n\nDouglas Dare is a London-based singer-songwriter, originally from the coastal town of Bridport, South West England. \n\nDouglas released his first EP 'Seven Hours' in September 2013 on the Erased Tapes label. It was received to much applause, with Mary Anne Hobbs describing the EP as, &quot;very strange and wonderful&quot;, and Drowned In Sound announcing him as &quot;a bright new talent&quot;. After an extensive European tour with fellow Erased Tapes artist, Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds, Douglas began recording his debut album 'Whelm' with his drummer/producer Fabian Prynn, before embarking on his first North American tour with label mate Nils Frahm in early 2014. \n\nHis live sound combines acoustic instrumentation including piano and percussion with glitchy electronic elements. Inspired by the likes of Portishead, Elliot Smith and James Blake, Douglas combines a rich and haunting vocal with lyrics crafted from his own poems and short prose. \n\nEarly reviews of his debut album champion it's originality with The Quietus quoted as saying, &quot;it's bittersweet, raw and honest...&quot; and The Guardian calling it, 'distinctive and strikingly new.'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a486763f1fd11425fddcc5eef4e7e23f72dbfea8","amp;dn":"Douglas+Dare+-+Whelm+%282014%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a486763f1fd11425fddcc5eef4e7e23f72dbfea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,134,118,63,31,209,20,37,253,220,197,238,244,231,226,63,114,219,254,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
