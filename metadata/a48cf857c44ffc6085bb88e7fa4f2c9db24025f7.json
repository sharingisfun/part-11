Puppy, and they got to be pretty good record producers, and by the time the band signed with Warner Bros Records in 1967, they knew their way around a studio. Their first album for the label, It's a Happening World, was a minor and woefully unsung gem, full of interesting psychedelic and Baroque touches that make it sound like the Beach Boys circa Pet Sounds, or the Beatles just as they stepped off into &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; territory, all complete with those trademark vocal harmonies and inventive arrangements The Tokens were known for. The best tracks, like &quot;Portrait of My Love,&quot; the Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil-penned title tune, &quot;It's a Happening World,&quot; and the delightful &quot;Grey City Day&quot; are all solid examples of intelligent late-'60s sunshine pop, and the album deserved to fare better than it did with both the critics and the market place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48cf857c44ffc6085bb88e7fa4f2c9db24025f7","amp;dn":"The+Tokens+-+It%27s+A+Happening+World+%281967%29+MP3%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48cf857c44ffc6085bb88e7fa4f2c9db24025f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,140,248,87,196,79,252,96,133,187,136,231,250,79,44,157,178,64,37,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
