After reading Primetime Propaganda, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never watch TV the same way again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Mark Levin\n\nMovie critic Michael Medved calls Ben Shapiro, Ã¢â‚¬Å“One of our most refreshing and insightful voices on the popular culture, as well as a conscience for his much-maligned generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With Primetime Propaganda, the syndicated columnist and bestselling author of Brainwashed, Porn Generation, and Project President tells the shocking true story of how the most powerful medium of mass communication in human history became a vehicle for spreading the radical agenda of the left side of the political spectrum. Similar to what Bernard GoldbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bias and A Slobbering Love Affair did for the liberal news machine, ShapiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Primetime Propaganda is an essential expose of corrupting media bias, pulling back the curtain on widespread and unrepentant abuses of the Hollywood entertainment industry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a26716d1aead5ea630246c448aeed693c53e09","amp;dn":"Primetime+Propaganda%3A+The+True+Hollywood+Story+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a26716d1aead5ea630246c448aeed693c53e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,162,103,22,209,174,173,94,166,48,36,108,68,138,238,214,147,197,62,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
