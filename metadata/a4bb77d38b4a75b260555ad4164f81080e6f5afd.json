My Morning Jacket have made the move to the bigs in tremendous style...[the album's length, its one major flaw] is a small concern considering the riches that await inside.&quot; Grade: 8.3/10 \nSpin Magazine: &quot;This time, the band lug the still-smoking amps from their lightning-strike live show into the studio and let the noise chase the midnite vultures away.&quot; Grade: 9.1/10 \nRobert Christgau: &quot;...and I guess his (Jim James's) boys are trickier than Crazy Horse, just not in any way you haven't heard before. Then there's his filtered drawl, his straitened tune sense, his lyrics you feel cheated straining for, his 12 songs in 72 minutes.&quot; Grade: C \n\nripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bb77d38b4a75b260555ad4164f81080e6f5afd","amp;dn":"My+Morning+Jacket...It+Still+Moves%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D--","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4bb77d38b4a75b260555ad4164f81080e6f5afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,187,119,211,139,74,117,178,96,85,90,212,22,79,129,8,14,111,90,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
