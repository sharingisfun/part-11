Rodney&amp;#039;s all beer and sympathy bu Del&amp;#039;s got an idea - could this be the answer to Boycie and Marlene&amp;#039;s dreams of a child and a golden opportunity to make a few bob along the way?\n\nThe Miracle Of Peckham:\n\nDel reckons he&amp;#039;s discovered a miracle. The statue of the Virgin Mary at the local church has been spotted weeping. Del soon has the cream of the world&amp;#039;s media paying to fill the event - and, of course, its nothing to do with a leaky church roof.\n\nThe Longest Night:\n\nA robber makes a raid on a local supermarket just as Del and his family are out shopping. What&amp;#039;s worse - Del sold him a duff watch down the market and its that that&amp;#039;s got them into trouble in the first place.\n\nTea For Three:\n\nLook out! Del&amp;#039;s tampered with the sunbed controls and Rodney&amp;#039;s seeing red - literally! He&amp;#039;ll hardly wow Trigger&amp;#039;s lovely niece, Lisa, with his good looks now - which leaves the way pretty clear for Del himself. But revenge should certainly be sweet when he volunteers Del for a spot of hang-gliding...\n\nVideo Nasty:\n\nRodney has gained a grant from the local council to make a community film and Del soon see&amp;#039;s its earning potential. Mickey Pearce on the other hand sees the chance to make a far more dodgy type of movie.\n\nWho Wants To Be A Millionaire:\n\nDel&amp;#039;s old pal Jumbo Mills is back with tales of his booming business in Australia. What&amp;#039;s more he wants Del to go back down under with him as his partner in enterprise. Could Del really leave Peckham for good?\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4be71a399de249c536e70643f16dbd375e175a6","amp;dn":"Only.Fools.And.Horses.Complete.Series5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4be71a399de249c536e70643f16dbd375e175a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,190,113,163,153,222,36,156,83,110,112,100,63,22,219,211,117,225,117,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
