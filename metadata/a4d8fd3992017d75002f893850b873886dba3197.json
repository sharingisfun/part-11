Then he lost his wife to human madness and that young man was gone, replaced by the Loner, the wandering son of legendary gunfighter Frank Morgan, and now the current occupant of a cell in the brutal and unforgiving Hell Gate prison. The Kid's crime? He looked too much like an outlaw who escaped from this very prison. So the Kid teams up with a fellow inmate with an escape plan, vowing to hunt down a look-alike killer on the loose. But in or out of prison, Frank Morgan's boy knows better than to trust anyone. When you live by the gun, any day could be your last--and every bullet must be your best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d8fd3992017d75002f893850b873886dba3197","amp;dn":"Johnstone%2C+J.A.-The+Loner+Seven+DaysTo+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d8fd3992017d75002f893850b873886dba3197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,216,253,57,146,1,125,117,0,47,137,56,80,184,115,136,109,186,49,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
