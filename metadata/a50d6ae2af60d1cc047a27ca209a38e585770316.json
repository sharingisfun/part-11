At no point is the brass overwhelming or intrusive &amp; in fact, in its minimalism, it reminds us of Johann Johannsson's stirring modern classical explorations. following 'Volume 1''s renditions of Robert Wyatt songs, 'Volume 2' is an album that charts last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collaboration with the national champions of Great Britain. &quot;It works...best of all are the new brass arrangements of early favourites, from the bitter lament 'Blue Bleezing Blind Drunk' to the exquisite 'Fareweel Regality' 4/5 - Guardian.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50d6ae2af60d1cc047a27ca209a38e585770316","amp;dn":"The+Unthanks+-+Diversions+Vol+2+-+The+Unthanks+with+Brighouse+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50d6ae2af60d1cc047a27ca209a38e585770316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,13,106,226,175,96,209,204,4,122,39,202,32,154,56,229,133,119,3,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
