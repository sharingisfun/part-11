After a quick tune, Dave talks some suicide and sports, we see a rather sexual picture of Flutesy, Dave and Rat sing a song, we get to the bottom of â€œRat and Flutesy,â€ Dave talks about calling his ex, his rub and almost tug, his â€œfucket list,â€ and â€œThe East Side Dave Star Wars Spectacular.â€ Flutesy plays a song, we watch the 2012 video for â€œForget Tom Brady,â€ hear about Daveâ€™s Periscope show, the audience asks Dave questions, Dave shows us his grody foot, and we hear about Daveâ€™s latest therapy session. We also see little Ben on some Elmo holiday show, Dave professes his love to Boboâ€™s ass, and we learn some details on Daveâ€™s future funeral","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a533d0fabeb97b2e64259ba47b5b2e6477664540","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-09-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a533d0fabeb97b2e64259ba47b5b2e6477664540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,51,208,250,190,185,123,46,100,37,155,164,123,91,46,100,119,102,69,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
