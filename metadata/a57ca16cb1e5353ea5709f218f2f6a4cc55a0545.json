Seeds of the storyline were planted in the fallout of War of the Green Lanterns after the Guardians of the Universe stripped Hal Jordan of his Green Lantern status, and Sinestro once again became a member of the Green Lantern Corps. Feeling that the Corps was flawed due to their emotion and free will, the Guardians aimed to decomission the Corps, much like their first failed peacekeeping initiative, The Manhunters, and replace them with a new force known as the Third Army. In doing so, the Guardians plan to completely obliterate all of the Green Lanterns, as well as any other colored Corps through out the universe. Rise of the Third Army also serves as an introduction to a mysterious new Green Lantern known as Baz, who had been seen at war with the Justice League, during the Trinity War event.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/rise-of-the-third-army/4045-56863/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/rise-of-the-third-army/4045-56863/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/wrath-of-the-first-lantern/4045-56961/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/wrath-of-the-first-lantern/4045-56961/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFirst Torrent so... take it easy on me!\t(Ok technically second but I really HATE mistakes)\n\nI just put them in order.. would have to tip my hat to others for releasing them.
