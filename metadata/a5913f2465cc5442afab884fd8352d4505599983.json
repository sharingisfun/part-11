All manner of material and merchandise is available at the official website: http://nunsense.com/shows/nun1.cfm\n\nThe humor is gentle and old fashioned, with just enough saucy stuff thrown in to entertain the literate younger folks. Still (to be honest), this is VERY much a standard musical theatre type of production. By that I mean that people who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t generally care for musicals probably wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like this. However, the chance to see a stoned Mother Superior, or all the inside jokes for Catholics might just reach a few folks who otherwise might give this a miss. The strongest of the group is the original.\n\nThe only show missing from this torrent is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Meshuggah-Nuns!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which has not yet been released on film. As far as I can tell, this is the first torrent of any of the shows, let alone all of them together.

The sisters decide that the best way to raise the money is to put on a variety show, so they take over the school auditorium, which is currently set up for the eighth grade production of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrease.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Here we meet Reverend Mother Regina, a former circus performer; Sister Mary Hubert, the Mistress of Novices; a streetwise nun from Brooklyn named Sister Robert Anne; Sister Mary Leo, a novice who is a wannabe ballerina; and the delightfully wacky Sister Mary Amnesia, the nun who lost her memory when a crucifix fell on her head.

Two Franciscans come to claim Sister Mary Amnesia (who has won the Publishers? Clearing House Sweepstakes) as one of their own. At the same time the nuns hear that a talent scout is in the audience to see them strut their stuff. From the riotous bingo game run by Sister Amnesia to the hilarious duet, What Would Elvis Do?, to the rousing finale, There's Only One Way to End Your Prayers and That's to Say Amen!, this show will have you rolling in the aisles!\n\n\nSISTER AMNESIA'S COUNTRY WESTERN NUNSENSE JAMBOREE (1998 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196806/) is presented as a promotional tour for Sister Mary Amnesia?s newly released album, I Could've Gone to Nashville. After regaining her memory Sr. Amnesia realizes she is Sister Mary Paul, a former country singer. Reverend Mother, feeling that one should not waste God-given talent, gets Sister Mary Paul a recording contract and now she is on a national tour. Introducing two new characters, Sister Mary Wilhem (the convent nurse), and Father Virgil Manly Trott (Sister Leo?s real-life brother), this show is filled with hysterical one-liners and infectious comic tunes. Audiences participate in a rousing &quot;Country Auction&quot; and join with the cast as they sing We know that somewhere up in heaven you're a saint, Patsy Cline! Will Sister Amnesia leave the convent for the Grand Ole Op'ry? You'll have to wait till the finale, Do Unto Others to get the answer.\n\n\nNUNCRACKERS: THE NUNSENSE CHRISTMAS MUSICAL (2001 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285806/) is the first ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTV SpecialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ taped by the sisters in their convent basement studio for Cable Access.

Think of it as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMrs. Doubtfire enters the Convent.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Done totally seriously, this show is, to quote a critic, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œno drag.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ First performed in Brazil as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNovicas Rebeldes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNunsenseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ premiered in New York in 1998.
