Scott Glenn\nplays Alan Shepard, the first American in space; Fred Ward is Gus Grissom,\nthe benighted astronaut for whom nothing works out as planned; and Ed Harris\nis John Glenn, the straight-arrow boy scout of the bunch who was the first\nAmerican to orbit the earth. The remaining four Mercury boys are Deke Slayton\n(Scott Paulin), Scott Carpenter (Charles Frank), Wally Schirra\n(Lance Henriksen) and Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid). Wolfe's original book\nrelated in straightforward fashion the dangers and frustrations facing\ntheastronauts (including Glenn's oft-repeated complaint that it's hard to\nbe confident when you know that the missile you're sitting on has been\nbuilt by the lowest bidder), the various personal crises involving their\nfamilies (Glenn's wife Annie, a stutterer, dreads being interviewed on\ntelevision, while Grissom's wife Betty, angered that her husband is not\nregarded as a hero because his mission was a failure, bitterly declares\nI want my parade!), and the schism between the squeaky-clean public image\nof the Mercury pilots and their sometimes raunchy earthbound shenanigans.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sam Shepard.\n=&gt;-Scott Glenn.\n=&gt;-Ed Harris.\n=&gt;-Dennis Quaid.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Philip Kaufman.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Adventure : Drama : History.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1983.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.51 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 867 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 3h 12mn.\n=&gt;-The Right Stuff............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/right_stuff/\n=&gt;-The Right Stuff............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-right-stuff-1983/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 204 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b7c82f09a73fa2b886d4e46c2557b5db3b8e7e","amp;dn":"The+Right+Stuff+-+History+Adventure+1983+Eng+Subs+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b7c82f09a73fa2b886d4e46c2557b5db3b8e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,183,200,47,9,167,63,162,184,134,212,228,108,37,87,181,219,59,142,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
