Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5e448e1bd27ec481fc336f55b4995bf44d6a2bb","amp;dn":"Solar+Economy+-+Hermann+Scheer+-+Leader+of+Global+Solar+Revoluti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5e448e1bd27ec481fc336f55b4995bf44d6a2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,228,72,225,189,39,236,72,31,195,54,245,91,73,149,191,68,214,162,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
