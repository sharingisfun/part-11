Indeed, \nthe &quot;Violin Sonata in D minor&quot; of Camille Saint-SaÃŽÂ´ns and the &quot;Violin Sonata in \nA major&quot; of CÃŽËœsar Franck are so significant in French culture and evocative of \ntheir time, they are thought by literary scholars to have served as inspiration \nfor the fictional &quot;Vinteuil Sonata&quot; in Marcel Proust's Ã¢â€â€ la recherche du temps \nperdu. With Maurice Ravel's &quot;Violin Sonata&quot; reflecting a more modern and \nplayful approach to the genre, the program explores the warm sonorities and \nsubtle moods of French music, as channeled through the classical sonata \nform, and the refined expression of all three works is lovingly handled by Bell \nand his accompanist, Jeremy Denk. Bell's playing ranges from gossamer fine \nlines to thickly resinous attacks, and his command of the violin's timbres \nreveals the rich possibilities to be found in these pieces. For his part, Denk \nprovides flexible and understated support, with a piano part that ranges from \nrobust activity where needed to atmospheric delicacy. Sony's sound is clear \nand focused and gives the violin central placement, so all the shades of \nexpression and dynamics are easily heard above the piano. The Barnes and \nNoble exclusive edition of this album contains a bonus track, Gabriel FaurÃŽËœ's \n&quot;Berceuse,&quot; a poignantly lyrical masterpiece of the late Romantic era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5ec70f11504b04316c147defc4f68fa119b416b","amp;dn":"Joshua+Bell+and+Jeremy+Denk+-+French+Impressions+2012+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5ec70f11504b04316c147defc4f68fa119b416b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,236,112,241,21,4,176,67,22,193,71,222,252,79,104,250,17,155,65,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
