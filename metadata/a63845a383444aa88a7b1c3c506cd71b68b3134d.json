The eight-piece band included lead singer Frank Richard, Saxophonist Amadee Castenell, Trumpeter Joseph Fox, Guitarist Mario Tio, Bassist Earnest Dabon, Pianist Robert Dabon and Drummer Dewight Richards. The band also worked as the studio band for songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint, following the tenure of The Meters as Toussaint's band. Chocolate Milk backed Toussaint as a live band and on his album New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (1976), and also recorded with Paul McCartney. The band then signed with RCA Records.\n\nTheir first of eight albums released on RCA was Action Speaks Louder Than Words, an album that included a political message. The title cut, &quot;Action Speaks Louder Than Words&quot; (1975), has a break beat that has been sampled numerous times in hip hop music, including &quot;Move The Crowd&quot; from the 1987 album Paid in Full by Eric B. &amp; Rakim, and &quot;Don't Let Your Mouth Write A Check Your Ass Can't Cash&quot; (1991) by Stetsasonic.\n\nThe band became known for &quot;Action Speaks Louder Than Words&quot;, and other hit songs: &quot;Girl Callin'&quot; (1978), &quot;Say Won't Cha&quot; (1979). and &quot;I'm Your Radio&quot; (1980), The band was also known for their versatility in musical styles, later adding elements of [disco], prevalent on their hit, &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; (1981). Chocolate Milk broke up in 1983 due to the waning popularity of disco, numerous personnel changes, and changes in producers after splitting with Toussaint in 1980.\n\n1975 - Action Speaks Louder Than Words (39:15) 320 kbps\n-------------------------------------------------------\n01-Actions Speaks Louder Than Words\n02-Time Machine\n03-My Mind Is Hazy\n04-Confusion\n05-Pretty Pimpin' Willie\n06-Tin Man\n07-Chocolate Pleasure\n08-People\n09-Ain't Nothin' But A Thing\n10-Out Among The Stars\n\n1976 - Chocolate Milk (37:40) 256 kbps\n--------------------------------------\n01 - never ever do without you\n02 - how about love\n03 - spread a little love\n04 - you've got your spell on me\n05 - let the music take your mind\n06 - crazy about you\n07 - party happy\n08 - running away\n09 - pluck it\n\n1976 - Comin' (35:31) 192 kbps\n------------------------------\n01 Comin'\n02 Something New\n03 Do Unto Others\n04 Feel The Need\n05 With All Our Love\n06 Starbright\n07 I Refuse\n08 Island Love\n\n1977 - Were All In This Together (37:47) 320 kbps\n-------------------------------------------------\n01 - Grand Theft\n02 - Thinking of You\n03 - We're All in This Together\n04 - Help Me Find the Road\n05 - Fertility\n06 - America\n07 - That's the Way She Loves\n08 - Over the Rainbow\n09 - Girl Callin'\n10 - Fertility\n\n1979 - Milky Way (29:26) 320 kbps\n---------------------------------\n01-Save The Last Dance\n02-Hurry Down Sunset\n03-You're The One\n04-Milky Way\n05-Paradise\n06-Groove City\n07-Say Won'Tcha\n08-Doc\n09-Milky Way (Reprise)\n\n1980 - Hipnotism (35:47) 192 kbps\n---------------------------------\n01 I'm Your Radio\n02 Hipnotism\n03 Forever And A Day\n04 Hey Lover\n05 Body Rhythm\n06 I Can't Believe (You Said) It's Over\n07 Would It Be Alright?\n08 Dawn\n09 Showdown\n\n1981 - Blue Jeans (37:45) 320 kbps\n----------------------------------\n01 Blue Jeans\n02 Like My Lady's Love\n03 Running On Empty\n04 Honey Bun\n05 Let's Go All The Way\n06 I've Been Loving You Too Long\n07 Video Queen\n\n1982 - Friction (43:22) 320 kbps\n--------------------------------\n1.
