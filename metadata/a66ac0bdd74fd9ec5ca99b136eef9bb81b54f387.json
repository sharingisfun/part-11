(What's The Story) Morning Glory? is a non-stop train of tasty, ear-pleasing rock candy, with that, add in a little bit of swaggering attitude, and you have Oasis' niche. Probably their best album.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 48\nArtist: Oasis\nAlbum: (What's The Story) Morning Glory?\nYear: 1995\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66ac0bdd74fd9ec5ca99b136eef9bb81b54f387","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+%28What%5C%27s+The+Story%29+Morning+Glory+%5BFLAC-1995%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66ac0bdd74fd9ec5ca99b136eef9bb81b54f387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,106,192,189,215,79,217,236,92,169,155,19,110,239,155,184,27,84,243,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
