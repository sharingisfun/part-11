Any application can send audio stream to an output side of a cable, and any other application can receive this stream from an input side. All transfers are made digitally, providing NO sound quality loss (a bitperfect streaming).\n\nVAC behavior is similar to &quot;What You Hear&quot; (or &quot;What U Hear&quot;, &quot;Stereo Mix&quot;) feature of Sound Blaster Live! and Audigy cards. But it is only similar, not equivalent. If you simply need a function like &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; under Vista/Win7, there could be better to try to enable it in your audio adapter.\n\nIf more than one applications are sending audio to Virtual Cable device, VAC mixes all streams together. If more than one applications are receiving audio from Virtual Cable device, VAC distributes the same audio data among all targets.\n\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nLocal (console) session only (does not work via Remote Desktop or Terminal Services).\nWindows 5.x and 6.x platforms (32-bit and 64-bit). May work in Win2000 but not tested.\nUp to 256 virtual cable devices (some systems limit number of MME devices).\n1..20 milliseconds per interrupt/event.\n1..100 pin instances.\nAlmost any of fixed point PCM audio formats (1000..1000000 samples per second, 8..32 bits per sample, 1..8 channels). Floating point formats are not supported.\nAlmost no sound latency with maximal interrupt/event frequency.\nUnlimited number of clients connected to each port.\nSignal mixing (with saturation) between output port clients.\nPCM format conversion (sampling rate, bits per sample, number of channels).\nVolume control features (both attenuation and boost).\nChannel scattering/gathering mode.\nWatermark control technique to improve stream stability with unstable applications.\nControl Panel application to configure cables and watch their state.\nAudio Repeater application that transfers from any recording to any playback device.\n\n\nVersion 4.12 (01.04.12)\n----------------------\n\nFixed RtAudio buffer processing bug in Audio Repeater KS.\nAdded clock rate display to Audio Repeater.\nChanged number of worker threads limit to a number of logical CPUs.\n\n\n\n****************************************\nVirustotal Report: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2389923ca5fe43fafe9aa63cc915f23741fb93c5ca26ad1dc9f56c0263a7750c/analysis/1367806845/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2389923ca5fe43fafe9aa63cc915f23741fb93c5ca26ad1dc9f56c0263a7750c/analysis/1367806845/&lt;/a&gt;\n0/46 -Clean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69c00567ce0391ddf06a3a202ce5851ae216764","amp;dn":"Virtual+Audio+Cable+4.12+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69c00567ce0391ddf06a3a202ce5851ae216764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,156,0,86,124,224,57,29,223,6,163,162,2,206,88,81,174,33,103,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
