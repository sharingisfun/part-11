Before she can make that request to \nCharles, he is found dead, seemingly pushed off a Paris to Bordeaux train. \nWhile Regina was on holiday in MegÃƒÂ¨ve, Charles sold all their possessions \nmaking $250,000 in the process, and seemed to be on his way to the coast to \nleave the country for South America probably for good. The money, however, \nwas not among his possessions on the train, those possessions which are \nreturned to Regina. Regina further learns from Hamilton Bartholomew of the \nCIA that they were after him, Charles Lampert only the primary alias he has \nbeen using of late. During WWII, Charles, a member of the Office of Strategic \nServices (OSS), absconded with $250,000 worth of their gold bars that were \ndestined for the French Resistance. The US government wants that money back. \nCharles had a few partners in crime among the OSS, namely four men: Tex \nPanthollow, Leopold Gideon, Herman Scobie and Carson Dyle. Besides Dyle who \ndied in the war, Regina knows the other three men are still alive, as she \nrecognized them from a photograph as the three unknown men who attended \nCharles' funeral. They are now after her as they also want the money which \nthey believe she has, and will kill to get it. She knows nothing about the \nmoney, but realizes that it is her duty to find it to return it to its \nrightful owner, namely the US government, and that it may save her life \nfrom Charles' partners. Clues to the money's whereabouts may be among \nthose possessions Charles had on the train. Coming to Regina's aid is \nPeter Joshua, a man she met while she was in MegÃƒÂ¨ve. As Peter helps her, \nshe quickly falls in love with him, and he seemingly with her. Shortly \nthereafter, she also comes to the realization that Peter is keeping as \nmany secrets as Charles did, and as such he is a person she perhaps \nshould not be trusting.\n\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Cary Grant.\n=&gt;-Audrey Hepburn.\n=&gt;-Walter Matthau.\n=&gt;-George Kennedy.\n=&gt;-James Coburn.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Stanley Donen.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Mystery : Suspense : Classics : Comedy.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1963.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.42 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 795 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 53mn.\n=&gt;-Charade....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003883-charade/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1220 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 678 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 158 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6eed06b56cf1ecb97b72ff4d7560c7b828aadfc","amp;dn":"Charade+-+Cary+Grant+Audrey+Hepburn+Mystery+1963+Eng+Subs+720p+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6eed06b56cf1ecb97b72ff4d7560c7b828aadfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,238,208,107,86,207,30,203,151,183,47,244,215,86,12,123,130,138,173,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
