The picture quality is not the best, yet still better than the one you can see on youtube.\n\nThere is a high quality Hungarian DVD release of the same film, though, which is unfortunately of different length and cut, but would anyone with some experience in digital media could probably mix the two into a dual-audio format.

A magic funhouse of retro kitsch. A lost treasure. These are just a few ways animation mavens describe Hugo the Hippo, a widely-bootlegged cult curio from the 1970s about an orphaned hippopotamus and the sweet child who befriends him. This magical, color-drenched Ã¯Â¬ï¿½lm is voiced by the likes of Burl Ives, Paul Lynde and Robert Morely, and topped off by pop confections sung by Marie and Jimmy Osmond. Directed in 1975 by multiple Emmy winner Bill Feigenbaum (his only feature) behind the Iron Curtain and financed by the perfume giant Faberge, the film was inexplicably buried by 21st Century Fox upon its US release, and to this day still doesn't have an official English digital release. Glimpses of the Ã¯Â¬ï¿½lmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funkiness, musicality and psychedelic charm can be seen on YouTube, but chances to bask in a print of the Ã¯Â¬ï¿½lm come around next to never. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_the_Hippo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_the_Hippo&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074657/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074657/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!\n\n(K) Kopyleft 2013 - All Rites Reversed...\n\np.s.
