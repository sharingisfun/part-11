Augustine said that babies deserve to go to hell. Berkeley asserted that matter doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist. Bentham would have argued that Dan Brown is better than Shakespeare. All these statements stem from philosophyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest minds. What were they thinking? Overflowing with compelling arguments for the downright strange Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many of which are hugely influential today Ã¢â‚¬â€œ popular philosopher Gary Hayden shows that just because something is odd, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that someone hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t argued for it. Spanning ethics, logic, politics, sex and religion, this unconventional introduction to philosophy will challenge your assumptions, expand your horizons, infuriate, entertain and amuse you. Gary Hayden is a journalist and popular philosopher. He has a masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree in philosophy and has written for The Times Educational Supplement. He is the author of This Book Does Not Exist: Adventures in the Paradoxical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72e64bbefc597eaf1dd4c1c7ea44ca9489f7da7","amp;dn":"You+Kant+Make+it+Up%3A+Strange+Ideas+From+Great+Philosophers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72e64bbefc597eaf1dd4c1c7ea44ca9489f7da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,46,100,187,239,197,151,234,241,221,76,28,126,164,76,169,72,159,125,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
