Excellent detail all over, carefully researched; you'll need a steady hand, sharp scissors, clear tape and white glue, to assemble this many-layered beauty. 51 two-sided pages of papercraft &quot;parts&quot; (that's a lotta parts!), plus instructions. \n\n\nThis book was pretty easy to follow the instructions even though I can't read or write Japanese.
