This hands-on book delivers a clear, pragmatic approach to web services by providing an architectural overview, complete working code examples, and short yet precise instructions for compiling, deploying, and executing them. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to write services from scratch and integrate existing services into your Java applications.\n\nWith greater emphasis on REST-style services, this second edition covers HttpServlet, Restlet, and JAX-RS APIs; jQuery clients against REST-style services; and JAX-WS for SOAP-based services. Code samples include an Apache Ant script that compiles, packages, and deploys web services.\n\nLearn differences and similarities between REST-style and SOAP-based services\nProgram and deliver RESTful web services, using Java APIs and implementations\nExplore RESTful web service clients written in Java, JavaScript, and Perl\nWrite SOAP-based web services with an emphasis on the application level\nExamine the handler and transport levels in SOAP-based messaging\nLearn wire-level security in HTTP(S), users/roles security, and WS-Security\nUse a Java Application Server (JAS) as an alternative to a standalone web server\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nMartin Kalin has a Ph.D. from Northwestern University and is a professor in the College of Computing and Digital Media at DePaul University.
