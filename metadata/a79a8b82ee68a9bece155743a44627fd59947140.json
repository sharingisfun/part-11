Yeah, Tampa had its rightful place on the throne in the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s/early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s, but the former French Canadian trading post had Dr. Shrinker, Phantasm, Accidental Suicide, and the mighty Morta Skuld. Perhaps the most visible of all Wisconsin death metal acts was Morta Skuld. With their down-tuned, catchy Midwestern death, the group caught the ears of UK cult indie Deaf/Peaceville Records, under which three full-lengths were released to moderate success.\n\nTwenty-one years later, Relapse Records has compiled Morta SkuldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two 1990 demos Ã¢â‚¬â€ Prolong the Agony and Gory Departure Ã¢â‚¬â€ in the form of Through The Eyes Of Death. Produced by Death manager Eric Greif and with artwork by Travis Smith, Through The Eyes Of Death is a fitting deathsong to Morta SkuldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. To celebrate Morta Skuld in the age of YouTube and viral videos, Relapse Records and director Doug Cook lensed a music video for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prolong the Agony (Crucifix)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœProlong the AgonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was written 21 years ago,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains Morta Skuld guitarist Dave Gregor. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When we started shooting the video, I felt a bit lost and as we went take after take the vibe started to come back to me, kinda like that adage about riding a bike. When we were writing this song I was really into everything must be evil stage. My drummer Jef Jaeger and I wrote the lyrics not to glorify crucifixion but to describe the act of what one would feel and what one would go through being subjected to that act. The entire second Morta Skuld demo Prolong the Agony was about what one would feel or experience going through these horrid things. Doug Cook had a great vision for the vid that was a realization of the lyrics.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nTrack List\n\n1. Serving Two Masters 03:51\n2. The Truth Divides Us 04:19\n3. Destroy Us 05:03\n4.

Their first break under the line-up Dave Gregor (guitars/vocals), Jason Hellman (bass), Jason OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connell (guitar) and Kent Truckenbrod (drums) was on the British Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacevilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Dying Remains (1993), As Humanity Fades (1994) and For All Eternity (1995) but the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to get the exposure in their homeland forced them to switch to Ã¢â‚¬ËœPavementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢for Surface (1998). With new drummer Jason Mooney, the band announced a change in direction from their grinding mid-paced Death Metal in 2002 to an Industrial Nu-Metal, a style in line with Static-X or Skinlab, and a new name, MS2. More recently Hellman and Gregor have been seen in a new band called 9mm Solution, most likely signaling the end to Morta Skuld. In 2011 Morta Skuld announced they would be bringing back the Morta Skuld name with new material, and in 2012 began playing their first shows.\n\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tOld School Death Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t50.69 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n6 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a79a8b82ee68a9bece155743a44627fd59947140","amp;dn":"Morta+Skuld+-+Serving+Two+Masters+%28EP%29+mp3++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a79a8b82ee68a9bece155743a44627fd59947140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,154,139,130,238,104,169,190,206,21,87,67,164,70,39,253,89,148,113,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
