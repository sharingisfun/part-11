The researchers are colliding particles hoping to discover confirmation of their theories and further secrets of the universe.They are looking for the Higgs Boson, which has also been called the &quot;God particle.&quot;\n\nNot only are they looking for the &quot;God particle&quot; but the scientists are basically playing God again at the vast cost of an estimated Ã‚Â£5 billion and whilst they, of course, claim it is all safe, the question any logical mind will ask is but how do they know and what if it isn't? Today marks the day they have switched it on and claim to have done their first successful test.\n\nThe CERN logo is plainly 666, the number of the Biblical Beast of Revelations!\n\nOutside the CERN building is a statue of the Hindu god Lord Shiva, who represents the divine force of destruction. We may wonder why they chose this deity?\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are very conCERNed about the whole project, and not surprisingly! I share their concerns and can think of far more sensible uses the incredible amount of money spent on this could have been used for.\n\nMichael Tsarion puts forward the idea that the beings described in the Bible as the Nefilim/Nephilim were aliens and that they had been pursued here from another part of the universe and imprisoned within a stargate to put the Earth in quarantine. Michael believes that these beings lost their advanced technologies when Atlantis was destroyed and that ever since they have been working using humans to rebuild the machines and technology they need. The plan, according to Tsarion, is eventually to blast through the stargate that holds them prisoner here. Could this be the real reason for the Large Hadron Collider? I hope not!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a79a9f5054706f667cfebaea30134d02ee67009e","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+65+-+CERN+-+Dark+Matter+-+Inter-Dimensiona","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a79a9f5054706f667cfebaea30134d02ee67009e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,154,159,80,84,112,111,102,124,254,186,234,48,19,77,2,238,103,0,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
