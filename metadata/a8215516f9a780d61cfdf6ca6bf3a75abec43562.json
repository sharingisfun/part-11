It featured greatest hits from their first six albums. The album was originally released on December 1, 1975 in the UK and then in February of 1976 in the US. \n\nAlbum reviews \n\nWe Sold Our Soul for Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll is a good single-disc collection of many -- but not all -- of Black Sabbath&amp;#039;s best tracks from the Ozzy Osbourne era, drawing about half of its material from the group&amp;#039;s first two albums, Black Sabbath and Paranoid. That makes it ideal for the fan who only wants one Black Sabbath disc, but those who want to dig deeper should be advised that all six LPs from the Osbourne period contain high-quality items not present here, especially the under-represented Master of Reality and Vol. 4. Still, there&amp;#039;s no quibbling with what is here. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide \n\nAlbum credits \nPatrick Meehan Producer \nBill Ward Drums, Vocals \nRodger Bain Producer \nMike Butcher Producer \nGeezer Butler Bass, Guitar (Bass) \nTony Iommi Guitar \nBlack Sabbath Producer, Main Performer \nOzzy Osbourne Harmonica, Vocals \n\nReleased December 1, 1975 (UK), \nFebruary 1976 (US) \nRecorded 1970-1975 \nGenre Heavy metal \nLength 74:01 \nLabel Vertigo (UK) \nWarner Bros.
