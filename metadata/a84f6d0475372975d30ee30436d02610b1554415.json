The hallmark feature of the text is its liberal use of practical applications to illustrate important principles. The applications come from every field of engineering and feature exciting technologies such as Ohio State's world-record setting electric car. The appeal to non-EE's is further heightened by such special features as the book's Focus on Measurement sections, Focus on Methodology sections, and Make the Connection sidebars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84f6d0475372975d30ee30436d02610b1554415","amp;dn":"Principles+and+Applications+of+Electrical+Engineering+-+%28Malestr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84f6d0475372975d30ee30436d02610b1554415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,79,109,4,117,55,41,117,211,14,227,4,54,208,38,16,177,85,68,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
