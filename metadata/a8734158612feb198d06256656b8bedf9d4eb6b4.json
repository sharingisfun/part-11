It offers 21 numbers from Berkeley films and allows them to be played in sequence, with a complete running-time of 163 minutes. It's the sort of DVD that could be streamed in the background at a party, eventually winning over distracted guests from their conversations and cocktails as they become entranced by the striking choreography of human bodies that Berkeley made famous. \nFrom 42nd Street, there's &quot;Shuffle off to Buffalo,&quot; &quot;Young and Healthy,&quot; and the titular &quot;42nd Street.&quot; \nNext up is Gold Diggers of 1933 with &quot;Were in the Money,&quot; &quot;Pettin' in the Park,&quot; &quot;Shadow Waltz,&quot; and &quot;Remember my Forgotten Man.&quot; \nThen there are the numbers from Footlight Parade: &quot;Ah, the Moon is Here,&quot; &quot;Sittin' on a Backyard Fence,&quot; &quot;Honeymoon Hotel,&quot; &quot;By a Waterfall,&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Lil.&quot; \nFrom Fashions of 1934 (1934) there's &quot;Spin a Little Web of Dreams,&quot; and from the same year's \nWonder Bar is &quot;Don't Say Goodnight.&quot; \nDames offers &quot;The Girl at the Ironing Board,&quot; &quot;I Only have Eyes For You,&quot; and &quot;Dames,&quot; while \nGold Diggers of 1935 is represented with &quot;The Words are in My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Lullaby of Broadway.&quot; \nFrom 1935's In Caliente is &quot;The Lady in Red,&quot; while rounding out the disc is &quot;All is Fair in Love and War&quot; from Gold Diggers of 1937. \n\nThese are all great numbers, and, again, as a disc for parties and for those not familiar with the works of the director, it's an eye-opening affair. But as a bonus disc available only to those who buy the box set, its something of a disappointment. Three-fourths of the material here are sequences from films that one must own to even get this, leaving only four numbers for those looking to watch Berkeley set-pieces from films that will likely never see digital daylight. This could have been a collection of forgotten and lost numbers from films like 1933's Roman Scandals, but alas this is mostly a repackaging of a Laserdisc release Ã¢â‚¬â€ meant at the time for those looking to get a Berkeley fix with few alternatives Ã¢â‚¬â€ and is almost identical in content (less the blackface number &quot;Goin' to Heaven on a Mule&quot; from Wonder Bar). The material itself is top notch, these are without doubt some of the best numbers that Berkeley produced, and some of the greatest sequences from musical films Ã¢â‚¬â€ but there's also no ignoring the opportunity wasted. Keep-case. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 164 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 164 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8734158612feb198d06256656b8bedf9d4eb6b4","amp;dn":"The+Busby+Berkeley+Disc+-+Xvid+2cd+-+21+Song+and+Dance+Numbers+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8734158612feb198d06256656b8bedf9d4eb6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,115,65,88,97,47,235,25,141,6,37,102,86,184,190,223,157,78,182,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
