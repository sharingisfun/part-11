Tess Delaney makes a living restoring stolen treasures to their rightful owners. People like Annelise Winther, who refuses to sell her long-gone motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved necklace Ã¢â‚¬â€ despite TessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice. To Annelise, the jewelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s value is in its memories. But TessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own history is filled with gaps: a father she never met, a mother who spent more time traveling than with her daughter. So Tess is shocked when she discovers the grandfather she never knew is in a coma. And that she has been named in his will to inherit half of Bella Vista, a hundred-acre apple orchard in the magical Sonoma town called Archangel. The rest is willed to Isabel Johansen. A half sister sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never heard of. Against the rich landscape of Bella Vista, Tess begins to discover a world filled with the simple pleasures of food and family, of the warm earth beneath her bare feet. A world where family comes first and the roots of history run deep. A place where falling in love is not only possible, but inevitable. And in a season filled with new experiences, Tess begins to see the truth in something Annelise once told her: if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe memories are worth more than money, then perhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve not made the right kind of memories. From one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved writers, The Apple Orchard is a story of family ties Ã¢â‚¬â€ both old and new Ã¢â‚¬â€ and of the moments that connect our hearts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a873664dbfadbea2074ac774685c90a346447366","amp;dn":"The+Apple+Orchard+-+Susan+Wiggs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a873664dbfadbea2074ac774685c90a346447366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,115,102,77,191,173,190,162,7,74,199,116,104,92,144,163,70,68,115,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
