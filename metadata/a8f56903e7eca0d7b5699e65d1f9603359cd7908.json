Phillips, an easygoing Alabama teenager, enlisted along with a buddy.

Sledge watched his best friend and his brother go off to warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and finally rebelled against his parents to follow them. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShiftyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Shofner was the scion of a prominent family with a long record of military service. Ensign Vernon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Micheel left the family farm to complete flight school.  \n\nBetween AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s retreat from China in late 1941 and the moment that MacArthurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plane landed in Japan in August 1945, these five men fought many of the key battles of the war in the Pacific. Here, Hugh Ambrose focuses on their real-life experiences and those of their fellow servicemen, enhancing and expanding upon the story told in the HBO miniseries. \n\n _ _ _\n\nFrom Wiki - on the TV series:\n\nThe Pacific is a ten-part television World War II mini-series, produced by HBO, that premiered in the United States on March 14, 2010.
