The original choice for director was Georg Wilhelm Pabst who quit at the last minute.\n\nIn the film Silvana Mangano plays two roles, as Penelope, the faithful wife of Ulysses and the sorceress, Circe. American star Kirk Douglas plays the Greek hero, Ulysses. Anthony Quinn plays Antinous. \nThe tremendous success of this film led to the making of Hercules (1958), which was credited with igniting the Italian peplum craze of the 1960s.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Silvana Mangano as Circe/Penelope\n    Kirk Douglas as Ulysses\n    Anthony Quinn as Antinous\n    Rossana PodestÃƒÂ  as Nausicaa\n    Jacques Dumesnil as Alcinous\n    Daniel Ivernel as Eurylochus\n    Sylvie as Eurycleia\n  \nDirected by Mario Camerini, Mario Bava (uncredited)\nProduced by Dino De Laurentiis, Carlo Ponti\nMusic by Alessandro Cicognini\nRunning time 115 min.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW:- Ulysses 1954\nThis very expensive Italian-made adaptation of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot; stars Kirk Douglas as seafaring hero Ulysses. The story begins, as ever, with Ulysses leaving his faithful wife Penelope (Silvano Magnano) behind as he goes off to fight in the Trojan Wars. Having the poor taste to set himself above the gods after a stunning military victory, Ulysses is doomed to journey aimlessly across the sea until he can make amends. Along the way, our hero battles a cyclops, resists the fatal singing of the Sirens, and enjoys a brief interlude with pig-fancying enchantress Circe (also played by Silvano Magnano). Years and years later, Ulysses returns to Penelope, where he must meet and master a final challenge. Acceptable enough when first released in 1954, Ulysses pales in comparison to the high-tech, all-star 1997 TV miniseries version of The Odyssey.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 765 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 115 mins\nSubtitles: English, Espanol\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a93a2aedfb914444a030effc1c296e8e52234e7f","amp;dn":"Ulysses+%281954%29+Xvid+1cd+-++Subs-Eng-Espanol+-+Kirk+Douglas%2C+Silv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a93a2aedfb914444a030effc1c296e8e52234e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,58,42,237,251,145,68,68,160,48,239,252,28,41,110,142,82,35,78,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
