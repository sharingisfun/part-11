However, as widely read Internet writer, Rev.\nMark Dankof, put it quite correctly: &quot;The Vanunu-Piper allegations about\nIsrael will not go away.&quot;\n\nNew Evidence Ties Israel's Nuclear Weapons Program to\nThe New Orleans Connection in the JFK Conspiracy . . .\nAs the second printing of the sixth edition of this book went to press, a\nsource with intimate, high-level knowledge about the NUMEC nuclear plant\nin Pennsylvania that smuggled nuclear materiel to Israel (see Chapter 8)\nprovided documentation to Michael Collins Piper that the family of\nEdith Rosenwald Stern, a prominent New Orleans Jewish leader, were key\nfinanciers behind NUMEC. Mrs. Stern was the closest friend of Clay Shaw, the\nlongtime CIA asset charged by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in\nthe JFK conspiracy. Final Judgment had already documented Shaw's ties to\nIsraeli intelligence, so the NUMEC-Stern connection is all the more\ndamning and, with other data, explains why Garrison ultimately\nconcluded there was an Israeli connection behind the conspiracy. And\nnote this: Another NUMEC investor was Pittsburgh's CIA-connected\n&quot;right wing&quot; billionaire Richard Scaife, whose protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Joe Farah, a vocal\nsupporter of Israel, promoted a JFK conspiracy book evidently designed to\ndistract attention from Final Judgment. No more need be said.\nThe Israeli nuclear weapons link to the JFK assassination is\na realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a fact of history that is not going to go away . . .\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPREFACE:\nThe Unspoken Truth:\nIsrael's Central Role in the JFK Assassination Conspiracy\nSoft cover edition page [ i]\nWho's Who\nin the JFK Assassination\nConspiracy and Cover-Up\nPage [v], ebook page 54\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nThe Tie That Binds:\nWhat All of the Most Commonly Accepted JFK Assassination Theories Have in\nCommonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe Never-Mentioned Israeli Connection\nPage [1], ebook page 62\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nOff With His Head:\nA Mossad Plot to Kill an American President\nPage [14], ebook page 75\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nA Bad Habit:\nIsrael's Use of &quot;False Flags&quot; in Global TerrorismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nPointing the Finger of Guilt Elsewhere\nPage [19], ebout page 80\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nNo Love Lost:\nJFK, Meyer Lansky, the Mafia &amp; the Israeli Lobby\nPage [26], ebook page 87\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\nGenesis:\nJFK's Secret War With Israel\nPage [40], ebook page 101\n\nCHAPTER SIX\nThe Coming of the Messiah:\nLyndon Johnson Rushes to Israel's Rescue;\nU.S. Middle East Policy Is Reversed\nPage [59], ebook page 120\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nIsrael's Godfather:\nThe Man in the Middle\nMeyer Lansky, the CIA, the FBI &amp; the Israeli Mossad\nPage [72], ebook page 133\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nThick as Thieves:\nA Dangerous LiaisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nJames Jesus Angleton Israel, the CIA and the Mob\nPage [95], ebook page 156\n\nCHAPTER NINE\nA Little Unpleasantness:\nJFK's War With Israel's Allies at the CIA\nPage [110], ebook page 171\n\nCHAPTER TEN\nLittle Man's Little Man:\nMeyer Lansky &amp; Carlos Marcello--\nDid the Mafia Kill JFK?\nPage [124], ebook page 185\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\nCuban Love Song:\nMeyer Lansky, the Mafia, CIA, the Mossad\nand the Castro Assassination Plots\nPage [137], ebook page 198\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nAn Opiate for the Masses:\nThe Lansky-CIA-Southeast Asian Drug Pipeline\nand the Mossad Connection\nPage [146], ebook page 207\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nIsrael's California Connection:\nMickey Cohen and the JFK Assassination\nPage [156], ebook page 217\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nThe Errand Boy:\nJack Ruby Was More &quot;Mossad&quot; Than &quot;Mafia&quot;\nPage [167], ebook page 228\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nThe Twain Shall MeetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe Permindex Mystery:\nIsrael, the CIA, the Lansky Crime Syndicate\nand the Plot to Kill John F.
