Written like a graphic novel, this well-researched book shows how goddess worship &quot;morphed&quot; through the centuries until it climaxed in its present most common form: the worship of the Virgin Mary. In different cultures, the names were different, but the goddess was the same. She was the Queen of Heaven, the mother of the god. She became the Mediatrix through whom all must go to reach their god.\n\nAuthor David Daniels is a stickler for research, so no one will be surprised to find a 30-page section of End Notes, as well as annotated bibliography. You can check out his facts for yourself! It's a heavy subject, but the illustrations by Jack T Chick help to make the story flow, and a lot easier for the casual reader to understand.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English. He is currently Research Consultant for Chick Publications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ade400e2202b5a9a2e67f2fc81e856d8c52705","amp;dn":"Babylon+Religion+-+David+W.+Daniels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ade400e2202b5a9a2e67f2fc81e856d8c52705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,173,228,0,226,32,43,90,154,46,103,242,252,129,232,86,216,197,39,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
