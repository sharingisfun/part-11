District Attornet Harvey Dent, Gotham City's original crimefighter.  This two-issue prestige mini-series follows the rise of the first man to challenge a system rotten to its core... but without a Batarang to back him up.  But with every rise comes a fall.  There's always been something... off about Harvey Dent.  Another side... another face, if you will.  As Harvey's quests for law and order becomes ever elusive, that something will eat away at him until he's half the man he use to be.  And that's only the beginning...\n\nWritten by Mark Sable and pencilled by Jesus Saiz.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9beae66eab02fd5832f86bc23b8683292d8e780","amp;dn":"Two-Face+-+Year+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9beae66eab02fd5832f86bc23b8683292d8e780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,190,174,102,234,176,47,213,131,47,134,188,35,184,104,50,146,216,231,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
