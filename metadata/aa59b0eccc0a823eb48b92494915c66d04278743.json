Set in a mock World War II environment, the game has online capabilities, and was released to mediocre reviews and criticism.\n\nDuring WWII, the Saruvian Empire invades and conquers the entire mainland of the United Sovereign Territories and only the southernmost island of Johnstown is free. The UST is able to build a small fort on a deserted island between the two nations though and use it to harass enemy supply lines. The UST is a fictional nation standing in for the United States, using all US weapons and medals. The Saruvian Empire is a fictional nation standing in for Germany, using all WWII era German weapons, uniforms, names, and political terms.\n\nSimilar to Beach Head.\n\nInstall &amp; play.\n\nTested on Windows 7 / 8 32 bit.\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaKdCaaEN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaKdCaaEN&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa59b0eccc0a823eb48b92494915c66d04278743","amp;dn":"Operation+Blockade+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa59b0eccc0a823eb48b92494915c66d04278743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,89,176,236,204,10,130,62,180,139,146,73,73,21,198,109,4,39,135,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
