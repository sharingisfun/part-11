It is based upon the fairy tale Cinderella, particularly the French version Cendrillon, ou la Petite Pantoufle de Vair, by Charles Perrault. The story concerns a young woman forced into a life of servitude by her cruel stepmother and self-centered stepsisters, who dreams of a better life. With the help of her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella is transformed into a Princess and finds her Prince.\n\nCinderella is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for television. It was originally broadcast live on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role. The broadcast was seen by over 100 million people. It was subsequently remade for television twice, in 1965 and 1997. The 1965 version starred Lesley Ann Warren, and the 1997 one starred Brandy, in the title role. Both remakes add songs from other Richard Rodgers musicals.\n\n\n01 The Sweetest Sounds\n02 The Prince Is Giving A Ball\n03 In My Own Little Corner\n04 Falling In Love With Love\n05 Impossible, It's Possible\n06 Ten Minutes Ago\n07 Stepsisters' Lament\n08 Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful\n09 A Lovely Night\n10 There's Music In You\n11 There's Music In You (Live) (UK Bonus Track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8a467eddae134c4b774211e4ad5c1bc8c7ca13","amp;dn":"Cinderella+Musical+%281957%29+Original+Soundtrack+-+Rodgers+and+Hamm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8a467eddae134c4b774211e4ad5c1bc8c7ca13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,138,70,126,221,174,19,76,75,119,66,17,228,173,92,27,200,199,202,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
