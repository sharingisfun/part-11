The first dozen tracks, off of Sands of Time, are indispensable listening, while the second dozen, off of Wax Museum, are less polished but perhaps even more fun in their relatively loose performances. The disc also offers excellent sound and comes with very thorough annotation. This mid-priced disc is a genuine bargain and makes just about as good an introduction to the group as EMI's Come a Little Bit Closer: The Best of Jay &amp; the Americans. \n\nTaken from: [url]http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:jvfwxqugldje[/url]\n\nAMG Review for tracks: 01-12 - Sands Of Time: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dxfpxql5ldde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dxfpxql5ldde&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Review for tracks: 13-24 - Wax Museum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxfpxql5ldde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxfpxql5ldde&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso see Amazon.com page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DR4O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DR4O&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
