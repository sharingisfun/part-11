GPN, known for playing over 200 shows a year, have built a loyal, dedicated fan base across the U.S. from their incendiary live concerts.\n\nPotter recently made a special solo appearance at Los AngelesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famed Hollywood Bowl, performing with Stevie Wonder, Sharon Jones and Janelle MonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡e, among others. This summer, GPN made their debut on BonnarooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main stage as well as at this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lollapolooza festival in Chicago. The band will promote their first-ever Grand Point North Festival in Burlington, VT, on Aug. 13-14, then cap it all with a headlining show in New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Central Park Sept. 24.\n\nThe N.Y. Post called a recent GPN live show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a sizzling concertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the performance was a gripping moment in music where a girl and her band (whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve enjoyed critical and cult admiration) showed they could hold their own with the biggest acts in music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n&quot;Playing in Daryl Hall's living room is like stepping into a rock and roll time machine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ raved Grace. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd then they feed you, which is awesome. Daryl went above and beyond to make us feel welcome; even satiating my eternal thirst for old guitars and good wine. He's a class act.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nGPN joined Daryl to perform five songs from their self-titled release, including the serrated rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParis (Ooh La La),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which they performed recently on VH1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Divas telecast, along with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoney,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodbye Kiss,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLow RoadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThings I Never Needed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHall and the band also collaborated on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoom to Breathe,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a 1976 classic written by Daryl, which appeared on the Bigger Than the Both of Us album.\n\nSays Daryl: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrace and the Nocturnals have the kind of classic-rock influences--including The Band, Little Feat, JJ Cale, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that are very familiar to me, having experienced that era. We had a great time playing together.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aabee621ab8ccc6e515069fd3f024c8bca80f7a2","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%5C%27s.House.E45.Grace.Potter.WebRip.%5BPSo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aabee621ab8ccc6e515069fd3f024c8bca80f7a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,190,230,33,171,140,204,110,81,80,105,253,63,2,76,139,202,128,247,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
