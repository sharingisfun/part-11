Sea captain, privateer, and colonial governor, Woodes Rogers was one of the early eighteenth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boldest and most colorful characters. Pirate Hunter of the Caribbean is the definitive account of his incredible life.\n\nAt a time when EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maritime nations fought over islands and territories, and pirates and other scoundrels were flourishing, Rogers sailed into the center of the action. In 1708, in the midst of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war with Spain, Rogers was hired to lead a mission against Spanish targets in the Pacific. A fearless adventurer who lost his fortune as often as his temper, he battled scurvy and hurricanes and mutiniesÃ¢â‚¬â€and along the way captured a treasure galleon and rescued the shipwrecked Alexander Selkirk, whose four-year ordeal on a remote Pacific island inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 led to an explosion of piracy in the Caribbean, King George I appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas. There he found himself in charge of a string of islands being plundered by raucous felons, from the notorious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blackbeard,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who kept lit matches under his hat to give himself a hellish cast, to Charles Vane, a particularly brutal pirate captain, to Anne Bonny and Mary Read, rare female pirates who escaped the hangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s noose only by revealing their pregnancies.\n\nWith rich and vivid details and plenty of action, David Cordingly chronicles a rollicking adventure that is as fascinating and gripping as any seafaring legend","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaecf33cc3ae82344f62639dcfafa9765bc6a8b3","amp;dn":"Pirate+Hunter+of+the+Caribbean-+The+Adventurous+Life+of+Captain+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaecf33cc3ae82344f62639dcfafa9765bc6a8b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,236,243,60,195,174,130,52,79,98,99,157,207,175,169,118,91,198,168,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
