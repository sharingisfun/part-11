Since Joe's jump in 1960 two men have died in similar attempts.\n\nDuring Felix's intense physical training the cameras also capture the basejumper as he struggled to overcome a severe claustrophic reaction to the movement restricting pressure suit. Felix's issues with the suit could have jeopardised the mission and ultimately cost him his life if he was unable to conquer his fears.\n\nFinally with breath-taking footage of the curvature of the earth, BBC cameras followed Felix as he stepped out of the capsule, suspended by a giant balloon 26 miles above the earth. They followed his spectacular leap through the stratosphere at over 700 miles per hour and his triumphant landing in the New Mexico Desert.\n\nThis programme for the Learning Zone features interviews with the scientists and engineers working on the mission and intercuts them with material already shot to create a resource for Key Stage 3 and 4 pupils that will make the STEM subjects accessible, engaging and exciting.\n\nBBC\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 314 MB\nDuration (ms) : 29mn 15s\nTotal bitrate : 1 501 Kbps\n\n===================== Video =====================\nFormat : AVC\nFormat info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ace1cdc5c2ece09f829d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nUse of CABAC : Yes\nRefFrames : 3 frames\nCodec Id : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBitrate mode : Constant\nBitRate_Nominal/String : 1 404 Kbps\nWidth : 832 pixels\nHeight : 468 pixels\nAspect ratio : 16:9\nFramerate mode : Constant\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat : AAC\nFormat info : Advanced Audio Codec\nCodec Id : A_AAC\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannelPositions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nEncoded by : RMAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab05e3c041fa5f05aa63fd20827851ba40872957","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Science+of+Space+Dive+-+Learning+Zone+%282012%29+RMAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab05e3c041fa5f05aa63fd20827851ba40872957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,5,227,192,65,250,95,5,170,99,253,32,130,120,81,186,64,135,41,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
