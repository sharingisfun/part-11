At the Tote, Tucker head-butted a glass window to get the attention of punters smoking outside, falling through it. He then continued the show covered in blood.\nSounds like they should be one of the best ever.\n\n                  Volume III - Hell's Likely\n\n\nType:\n    Full-length\nRelease date:\n    November 23rd, 2012\n\n\nLabel:\n    Napalm Records\n\n    Songs\n   \n\n1. \tHell's Likely \t                02:22 \t  \n2. \tGo \t                       04:31 \t   \n3. \tBare Bones \t              03:17 \t  \n4. \t(Up All Night) Demons to Fight \t06:47 \t \n5. \tSittin Pretty \t               03:53 \t  \n6. \tI Want It Too \t                 05:14 \t \n7. \tBury Me \t                 05:43 \t \n  \t31:47 \t \n\n\n\nBand members\n\n    Mikey Tucker (vocals)\n    Ben Couzens AKA Cuz (guitars)\n    Pete Bell (bass)\n    Frank Trobbiani AKA Bones (drums)\n\nI found out about these guys late but better than never enjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab143a296ab2952ebedcc07094ba948a61e7bcf0","amp;dn":"Mammoth+Mammoth+-+Volume+III%3A+Hell%26rsquo%3Bs+Likely+%282012%29ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab143a296ab2952ebedcc07094ba948a61e7bcf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,20,58,41,106,178,149,46,190,220,192,112,148,186,148,138,97,231,188,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
