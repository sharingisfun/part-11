THE SILVER AGE OF COMIC BOOK ART highlights the careers of eight acknowledged hall of fame artists who drew definitive versions of the industry's greatest characters, while often setting trends in the look of comic book art itself. Arlen Schumer's book is the first to concentrate on the importance of these artists and their work, as well as the literary and sociological aspects of the Silver Age. Designed by the author using a distinctive graphic style, actual comic book art is enlarged to dynamic full- and double-page spreads, along with biographical text by the author, and thoughts, ideas and quotes from the artists themselves. Finally, here is an art book that pays proper homage to this great era of comic books and the amazing artists responsible for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1c580542217b6bfdf77f622dda6ef0ee2ac864","amp;dn":"The+Silver+Age+of+Comic+Book+Art.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1c580542217b6bfdf77f622dda6ef0ee2ac864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,28,88,5,66,33,123,107,253,247,127,98,45,218,110,240,238,42,200,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
