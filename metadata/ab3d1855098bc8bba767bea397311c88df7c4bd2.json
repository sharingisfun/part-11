Johnny Guitar watson mixed R&amp;B,Funk,Blues,Pop into a Stew.this Brother knew Groove&amp;Simplicity. He made it all work while maintaining His cool.He was also a One Man band.Played a Variety of Instruments.talk about a Cat changing musical lanes?? back in the 50's&amp;60's Johnny Guitar Watson was a strong Blues Based Cat.but when the Funk of the late 60's&amp;Early 70's ruled Johnny Guitar watson not only got on board,but also brought His own Brand. this collection captures all of His timeless Jams.He willCrack you up,but also make you think.He was a Pre-cursor to Hip-Hop as well.RIP to a Brother who did his talking with His Guitar.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is a very good compilation of JGWs funk work. It is ideal for anyone who wants the best of his various funk albums. There is a lot of humour in his lyrics, underpinned by some very tight and funky grooves, laced with lots of blues and jazz guitar licks. This is an all time favourite for me. I highly recommend it.&quot;     \n\n&quot;No one could've put together an better compilation on this legendary funk bluesman. I remember hearing a &quot;Real mutha for Ya&quot; in 76 when it came out and i was hooked on this brotha' from there on/ It was off an 8 track at that when i heard the title album. This is definitely a no brainer purchase for any real fan of blues or soul. And the funny thing is, is that you do not hear his name mentioned that often, if hardly ever.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
