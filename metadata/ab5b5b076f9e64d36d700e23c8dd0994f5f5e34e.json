In this case he's the secretary to the brutal governor of a penal colony.\n\nThis is a drama unlike Bunuel's later surrealist works, but you can see his touch in the way he plays up the absurd comedy of the situation, as well as the way in which sex is used as a weapon.\n\nIt's actally closer to Graham Greene tha Bunuel, but it's a solid movie if you approach it on its own terms. Mexican star Maria Felix (of Dona Barbara) turns in a particularly fiery performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5b5b076f9e64d36d700e23c8dd0994f5f5e34e","amp;dn":"La+fi%C3%A8vre+monte+%C3%A0+El+Pao+%281959%29+Bunuel+English+dub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5b5b076f9e64d36d700e23c8dd0994f5f5e34e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,91,91,7,111,158,100,211,109,112,14,35,200,221,9,148,245,245,227,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
