Super Potato's powerful designs for the interiors of restaurants, shops and hotels, as well as Takashi Sugimoto's designs for tea ceremony spaces and utensils, are richly complex compositions of materials which create simple, strong spaces. By finding contemporary expression for important concepts present in traditional Japan and combining materials in unexpected ways to create exciting spaces, Super Potato's work has had a significant impact on interior design in Japan and around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab81bd27cad7b72b4f79b96f9169206ef4b55791","amp;dn":"Super+Potato+Design+-+The+Complete+Works+of+Takashi+Sugimoto%2C+Ja","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab81bd27cad7b72b4f79b96f9169206ef4b55791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,129,189,39,202,215,183,43,79,121,185,111,145,105,32,110,244,181,87,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
