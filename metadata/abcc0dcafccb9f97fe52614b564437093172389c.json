This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nAs of this broadcast:\n\nThe top selling female vocal group of all time places a hit in the top 40. As of this countdown, these girls had put more #1 hits on the chart than any other American singing group in the history of pop music.\n\nThere is a hit that took four years to reach the top 40 from it's first release, during which time eleven other songs by the same singer made it.\n\nThree of this week's five new songs debut so high up on the chart, Casey doesn't even get to play them until the second hour.\n\nCasey remembers a woman who won an Academy Award at the age of fourteen for her role as Helen Keller in &quot;The Miracle Worker.' She was the youngest actress ever to win an Academy Award.\n\nThere is a singer in the countdown that was once credited by President Lyndon B. Johnson with preventing more death and destruction than any other entertainer in the business.\n\n40:  Maybe - The Three Degrees\n39:  Hitchin' A Ride - Vanity Fair\n38:  Julie Do You Love Me - Bobby Sherman\n37:  I Want To Take You Higher - Ike &amp; Tina Turner\n36:  Groovy Situation - Gene Chandler\n35:  Do You See My Love For You Growing - Jr. Walker &amp; The All-Stars\n34:  Solitary Man - Neil Diamond\n33:  Teach Your Children - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n32:  Lay Down (Candles In The Wind)-Melanie &amp; The Edwin Hawkins Singers\n31:  The Sly, The Slick &amp; The Wicked - The Lost Generation\n30:  Big Yellow Taxi - The Neighborhood\n29:  Hand Me Down World - Guess Who\n28:  Everybody's Got The Right To Love - The New Supremes\n27:  Summertime Blues - The Who\n26:  Ain't No Mountain - Diana Ross\n25:  Heidi-Ho - Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears\n24:  Westbound #9 - The Flaming Ember\n23:  Lookin' Out My Back Door - Creedence Clearwater Revival\n22:  Are You Ready - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric\n21:  Ohio - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\nOLDIE:  You Don't Have To Be A Baby To Cry - The Caravelles\n20:  Tell It All Brother - Kenny Rogers &amp; The First Edition\n19:  Overture From Tommy - The Assembled Multitude\n18:  25 Or 6 To 4 - Chicago\nOLDIE:  Don't Just Stand There - Patty Duke (1965)\n17:  The Love You Save - The Jackson Five\n16:  Patches - Clarence Carter\n15:  Get On Up (Sex Machine) - James Brown\nOLDIE:  Do You Want To Know A Secret - Beatles (1964)\nOLDIE: I've Gotta Be Me - Sammy Davis Jr.\n14:  Why Can't I Touch You - Ronnie Dyson\n13:  Lay A Little Lovin' On Me - Robin Mcnamara\n12:  I Just Can't Help Believing - B.J.
