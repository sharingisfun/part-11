His debut album, Dear, which crept out of his bedroom three years ago, dissected heartbreak with stark honesty. Its followup offers more of the same, but with studio polish: a querulous voice pitched between Conor Oberst and Marcus Mumford, a guitar played as gingerly as if he were handling raw eggs, and a piercing light shone on the dust of the past. &quot;Please do not hurt me love, I am a fragile one,&quot; he sings, with affecting simplicity, in 10am, Gare du Nord; only to shrug off love with careless brutality in Teach Me and Lying to You. Mid-album, this unvarying introspection begins to sound maudlin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but then Kronos erupts with malevolent force, all sinewy guitars and pounded drums, briefly stunned into silence by Henson's cutting note to self: &quot;You son of a bitch, stop writing songs like this.&quot; Actually, more like Kronos would be great.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac111968cc252ee90ccaffedd182a7de1a791219","amp;dn":"Keaton+Henson+-+Birthdays+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac111968cc252ee90ccaffedd182a7de1a791219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,17,25,104,204,37,46,233,12,202,255,237,209,130,167,222,26,121,18,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
