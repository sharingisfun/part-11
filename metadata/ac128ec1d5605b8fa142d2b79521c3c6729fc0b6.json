This book is an indispensable reference and text on food biochemistry and the ever increasing developments in the biotechnology of food processing.\nBeginning with sections on the essential principles of food biochemistry, enzymology, and food processing, the book then takes the reader on commodity-by-commodity discussions of biochemistry of raw materials and product processing. Chapters in this second edition have been revised to include safety considerations and the chemical changes induced by processing in the biomolecules of the selected foodstuffs. This edition also includes a new section on health and functional foods, as well as ten new chapters including those on thermally and minimally processed foods, separation technology in food processing, and food allergens.\nFood Biochemistry and Food Processing, second edition fully develops and explains the biochemical aspects of food processing, and brings together timely and relevant topics in food science and technology in one package. This book is an invaluable reference tool for professional food scientists, researchers and technologists in the food industry, as well as faculty and students in food science, food technology and food engineering programs.\n\nContents\nContributor List vii\nPreface xii\nPart 1: Principles/Food Analysis\nPart 2: Biotechnology and Ezymology\nPart 3: Meat, Poultry and Seafoods\nPart 4: Milk\nPart 5: Fruits, Vegetables, and Cereals\nPart 6: Health/Functional Foods\nPart 7: Food Processing\nPart 8: Food Safety and Food Allergens\nGlossary of Compound\nIndex 881","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac128ec1d5605b8fa142d2b79521c3c6729fc0b6","amp;dn":"Food+Biochemistry+and+Food+Processing+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac128ec1d5605b8fa142d2b79521c3c6729fc0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,18,142,193,213,96,91,143,161,66,210,183,149,33,195,198,114,159,192,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
