J. D. Hunley's two-volume work traces the evolution of this technology, from Robert Goddard's research in the 1920s through the development of the Titan missiles and launch vehicles in the 1960s to the refinement of the space shuttle in the 1980s.\n \nWith the first book devoted primarily to military hardware and the second to launch vehicle hardware, Hunley offers a sweeping overview of these impressive engineering innovations as well as insights into the dynamic personalities responsible for them. Together, the two volumes offer a unique, invaluable history of rocketry that should appeal to a wide range of scholars and space buffs.\n\nFormat: EPUB\nYear: 2008\nISBN-10: 0813031788\nISBN-13: 978-0813031781\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2163d5a6a642b37149e4c2f4c2920c51fc0ecb","amp;dn":"U.S.+Space-Launch+Vehicle+Technology+%26ndash%3B+Viking+to+Space+Shu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2163d5a6a642b37149e4c2f4c2920c51fc0ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,33,99,213,166,166,66,179,113,73,228,194,244,194,146,12,81,252,14,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
