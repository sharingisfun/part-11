His prowess on a soccer field has guaranteed him a home in a well-protected enclave. But Jon is painfully aware that a missed goal, a careless word, even falling in love, can put his life and the lives of his mother, his sister Miranda, and her husband, Alex, in jeopardy. Can Jon risk doing what is right in a world gone so terribly wrong?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6e8933d57082c4b31475440da61fe4ad3ba187","amp;dn":"The+Shade+of+the+Moon+-+Susan+Beth+Pfeffer.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6e8933d57082c4b31475440da61fe4ad3ba187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,110,137,51,213,112,130,196,179,20,117,68,13,166,31,228,173,59,161,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
