Veterans of a slew of Swedish punk and metal\nbands, the Hellacopters formed in the mid 1990s and have been\nchurning out textbook high-octane rock ever since.\n\nCombining the best of Detroit proto-punk, a la the Stooges\nand the MC5, with the scorching shriek of AC/DC and Van Halen,\nthe Hellacopters have no intentions of reinventing the wheel;\nrather, their simple goal is to keep it rolling on, rolling\nstrong. Raise your devil horns...now.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac77d1f98ba992b5701b37c4ed814b3fd8b01fa3","amp;dn":"The_Hellacopters-Head_Off-2008-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac77d1f98ba992b5701b37c4ed814b3fd8b01fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,119,209,249,139,169,146,181,112,27,55,196,237,129,75,63,216,176,31,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
