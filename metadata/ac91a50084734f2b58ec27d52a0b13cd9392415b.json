Art Keller is an obsessive DEA agent. The Barrera brothers are heirs to a drug empire. Nora Hayden is a jaded teenager who becomes a high-class hooker. Father Parada is a powerful and incorruptible Catholic priest. Callan is an Irish kid from Hellâ€™s kitchen who grows up to be a merciless hit man. And they are all trapped in the world of the Mexican drug FederaciÃ³n.
