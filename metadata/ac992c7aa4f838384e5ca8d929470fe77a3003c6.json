But A's real interest lies elsewhere--the mythical reels of the very first film shot by the Manakia brothers, who, at the dawn of the age of cinema, tirelessly criss-crossed the Balkans and, without regard for national and ethnic strife, recorded the region's history and customs. Did these primitive, never-developed images really exist? If so, where are they? - &quot;Why A? It's an alphabetical choice. Every filmmaker remembers the first time he looked through the viewfinder of a camera. It is a moment that is not so much the discovery of cinema--but the discovery of the world. But there comes a moment when the filmmaker begins to doubt his own capacity to see things, when he no longer knows if his gaze is right and innocent.&quot; --Theo Angelopoulos\n\n\nLanguages: English / Greek / Bulgarian / Albanian / Serbian / Kurdish\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac992c7aa4f838384e5ca8d929470fe77a3003c6","amp;dn":"Ulysses+Gaze+1995+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac992c7aa4f838384e5ca8d929470fe77a3003c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,153,44,122,164,248,56,56,78,92,168,217,41,71,15,231,122,48,3,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
