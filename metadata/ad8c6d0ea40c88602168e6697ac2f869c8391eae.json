Included are both 5.1 and stereo DTS audio tracks, multiple subtitle languages, and chapters. The grainy effect on the video is part of Jack's and the directors vision for the film, and not symptomatic of a poor transfer. A sample file is included.\n\n=Description=\nIn the summer of 2008 Jack Johnson took a trip through Europe playing everywhere from historical venues to classic outdoor stages making it the biggest tour of his career. The film is a collection of live performances with Jack's quartet along with special appearances by G. Love, Ben Harper, Mason Jennings, Neil Halstead and Matt Costa. Through weathering the stormy nights in Newquay to surfing on a river in Germany, to playing the packed house in London's Hyde Park, the film takes you on a trip and captures the connection between an audience and an artist on an international stage. This is more than a compilation of performances, this is an intimate look at Jack Johnson, his life on the road, and the unique dialogue he has with his fans. \n\n=From the Director=\nAll of Jack's profits from the 2008 tour, and this release will be going to fund the Kokua Hawaii Foundation and the Johnson Ohana Family trust which will provide continuing endowments to Jack's favorite environmental charities.  \n\nPlease donate here : http://www.kokuahawaiifoundation.org/ or better yet purchase a BluRay copy of this film and hear it in TRUE Lossless DTS-HD Master Audio!\n\n\n=File Information=\nFormat  : Matroska (MKV)\nFile size : 5.09 GiB\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nOverall bit rate : 9132 Kbps\n\n=Video=\nFormat : AVC\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9cd4f5fbf4dcd0a8b2ad&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBit rate : 5931 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 6144 Kbps\nWidth : 1920 pixels\nHeight : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nScan type : Progressive\n\n=Audio=\n-Track 1-\nDTS 5.1\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 1510 Kbps\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 24 bits\n-Track 2-\nDTS Stereo\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 1510 Kbps\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 24 bits\n\n\n=Subtitles=\nEnglish\nSpanish\nGerman\nItalian\nPortuguese\n\n\n=Chapters=\nHit The Stage And SLEEP THROUGH THE STATIC\nBELLE/BANANA PANCAKES\nHOME Is Where The Love Is\nRiver Surfing \nStorm Rolls In On The GOOD PEOPLE Of Munich \nSTAPLE IT Back TOGETHER\nBackstage In Amsterdam Into FLAKE\nAdam, Merlo, and Zach\nMason Sings ...The Band GO ON\nThe Road To Newquay\nRAINBOWS Over The Airwaves Into Small Surf\nDrawing Our Own CONSTELLATIONS\nSUNSHINE Hits London \nHOPE In Hyde Park\nMerlo WASTING TIME\nIt's High Tide Or Low Tide\nIF I HAD EYES From London To Paris\nALL AT ONCE\nANGEL/BETTER TOGETHER\nEnd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad8c6d0ea40c88602168e6697ac2f869c8391eae","amp;dn":"Jack+Johnson+-+En+Concert+%28H264+1080p+DTS+MKV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad8c6d0ea40c88602168e6697ac2f869c8391eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,140,109,14,164,12,136,96,33,104,230,105,122,194,248,105,200,57,30,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
