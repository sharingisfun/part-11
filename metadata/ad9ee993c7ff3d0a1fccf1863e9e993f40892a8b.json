Written by Affleck and Damon, and with Damon in the title role, the film follows 20-year-old South Boston laborer Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who is forced to see a therapist (Williams) and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor (SkarsgÃƒÂ¥rd) in order to avoid jail time for assaulting a police officer. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend (Affleck), his girlfriend (Driver), and himself, facing the significant task of thinking about his future.\n\nGood Will Hunting received universal critical acclaim and was a financial success. It grossed over US$225 million during its theatrical run with only a modest $10 million budget. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, and won two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWill es un joven rebelde con una inteligencia asombrosa, especialmente para las matemÃƒÂ¡ticas.
