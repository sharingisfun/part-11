A talented artist is blacklisted by the Communist government following the Russian occupation. Since he can&amp;#039;t live from his art and he won&amp;#039;t take a day job, his family has to make kitschy ceramic ornaments to get by. A chance encounter with an art historian combing through a garbage can brings the artist back into contact with a former student and lover. She&amp;#039;s more ambitious than principled and can make life easier for him in return for some gesture art. The artist can handle making a wall mosaic for her husband&amp;#039;s school, but a hideous statue of a Russian marshal is naturally more problematic. Eventually it doesn&amp;#039;t matter. Through the art historian, their names land on the Voice of America, and as a result, both families end up in the drink together.                                          \n\nWhen their names are heard over the banned radio station, the two couples fret for what seems like an eternity about what the fallout will be. Thirty years before, it could have meant the uranium mines in JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡chymov. Now their chief worry is where they will be able to spend their vacation. If it seems so petty, that&amp;#039;s because HÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â€žÂ¢ebejk is showing us life during &quot;normalization&quot;, the period that followed the crackdown in 1968, specifically 1981. Those people deemed normal to go to the seaside; those who weren&amp;#039;t had to settle for the misty lake. That simple.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard01-37.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard01-37.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard02-36.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard02-36.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard03-37.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard03-37.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard04-36.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard04-36.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard05-35.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/Clipboard05-35.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/balliaabn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/balliaabn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip------\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,464,198,472\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD Dev ver. 25-Mar-03\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:01:32\nFrame Count:....................................182275\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................576\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................320\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.800\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1148\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.249&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................448\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................6 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada8d5cc88a7a019e7c7769e20c544669ac07454","amp;dn":"Jan+Hrebejk+-+Pupendo+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada8d5cc88a7a019e7c7769e20c544669ac07454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,168,213,204,136,167,160,25,231,199,118,158,32,197,68,102,154,192,116,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
