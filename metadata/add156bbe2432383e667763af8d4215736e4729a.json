The family is gathering at the exclusive Duponte Hotel &amp; Resort in Montego Bay for the highly anticipated nuptials of former playboy billionaire Zack Romero and ex-reporter Blue Monroe. ChristianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-girlfriend, Arianna Duponte, who walked out on him over a month ago just when things were getting hot, happens to be the general manager of the five-star palace resort where the family is gathering. No woman has ever turned him down before. Yet, sweet Arianna wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just any woman. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d given him her virginity and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d given her his heart. So what went wrong? Will this be a bitter reunion or a better opportunity to find out if there are truly second chances? \n\nArianna Duponte has always had a special place in her heart for sexy, hot Christian Romero, her first true love, but getting close to him would be too risky given her past and a scandalous family secret. She refuses to break his heart again. She tries to keep her distance while preparing for the big Romero wedding but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not as easy as it looks. As the wedding bells echo in the sultry island air, will they rekindle the union they once had?
