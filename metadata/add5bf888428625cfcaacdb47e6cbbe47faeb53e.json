Panchishkin and E. Shavgulidze.\n\nThis study aid is to help the student to master the basic techniques of solving difficult problems in trigonometry. The book contains theoretical material, many worked competition problems, and some problems to be solved independently (the answers being at end of the book.) Intended for high-school and precollege students.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant and was first published by Mir in 1988. This book also has an ISBN Number 5030002227.\n\nPDF | OCR | Bookmarked | Paginated | 300 dpi | Cover | 9 MB\n\nReleased by mirtitles.org\n\nContents\nFrom the Authors\nContents\n5\nChapter 1.
