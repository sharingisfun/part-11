You will need to lead a group of survivors to construct your base and maintain its basic functions, such as electricity generation or food storage. Meanwhile, you will ensure the base's security by building defenses and setting traps. You will also need to lead your expedition team to the wasteland to gather supplies(food, water and raw materials for building) and to work on missions. Characters in Forsaken Fortress are highly dynamic in their behavior. They have needs, goals and personalities which will influence their daily life and decision making. Some of them may fall in love and some of them may not get along, but all them bring life to the devastated, forsaken world.\n\nBase Building and Management\nDesign and build your base to harbor your survivors. You need to build basic, life-sustaining facilities such as bedrooms, storage rooms, and kitchens to fulfill the basic needs of the survivors. You also need to construct supporting structures such as clinics to heal the injured, or play rooms to entertain your squad. Meanwhile, you need to ensure security of the base by building defenses such as electric traps, sandbags and bunkers.\n\nResource Collection and Missions\nYou need to lead your squad to collect resources (food, water and raw materials for building) and work on missions in the surrounding environment. There are many types of resources that you can find: wild creatures for hunting, ponds for water, trees for wood, dilapidated vehicles for scrap metal, and more. The most coveted prizes may not be left unguarded, and you may have to fight tooth-and-nail to acquire what you need.\n\nSquad Combat\nYou can divide your combat party into smaller squads (e.g. three squads of three troops each), at which point you can issue orders to a specific squad. For example, you can direct squad one to go to a location, and for squad two to follow. The charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ AI will react based on your orders, so that you won't have to worry about controlling everything in real time. However, through manual control, you can still retain some degree of tactical strategy, such as flanking the enemy.\n\nCustomization and Research\nYou can change your character's and your party members' clothing, armor, pants, shoes, helmet and shoulder-pads. You can also equip them with different accessories such as a backpack for carrying more loots or a sun glass to avoid sun-blindness. You can also assign your party members to do research on new medicine or new upgrades.\n\nCrafting\nYou can assign your squad members to craft new items, weapons, ammo and so on.\n\nPersonnel Management\nThroughout the game, you will find dozens of characters to join your team. Each character has unique personalities and traits.\nOutfit and balance your expedition teams to suit the needs of the mission, and assign squad members within the base to where they will be needed most Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fences will need repair, food must be cooked, the injured will need healing, and supplies must be distributed. Balance labor and relief to maximum squad members' morale. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add79527c2c8ee0d763222e8af984fe19c756b27","amp;dn":"Forsaken.Fortress.Full.Version.1.03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add79527c2c8ee0d763222e8af984fe19c756b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,215,149,39,194,200,238,13,118,50,34,232,175,152,79,225,156,117,107,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
