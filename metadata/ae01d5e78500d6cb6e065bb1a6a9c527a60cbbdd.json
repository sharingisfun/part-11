In The Run he crafts a blistering race through a difficult presidential campaign. \n\n  Mississippi Senator Will Lee is in the spotlight. In strictest confidence, the Vice President has told Lee that he will not run for President. He urges Lee to announce his candidacy. But when the President is felled by a stroke, the Vice President takes over. Now, uncertain of the Vice PresidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plans, Lee is in a perilous political position. Everywhere he turns, he sees layers of conspiracy building that threaten to derail his campaign. Stuart Woods creates a world of politics that echoes the fickle headlines of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s papers. With Frank MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gripping narration, The Run hurtles toward an explosive conclusion. Its twists and turns will keep you in suspense until the last vote is cast.\n\n\n  From Wiki:\n\n  The Run is the fifth novel in the Will Lee series by Stuart Woods.
