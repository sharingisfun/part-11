The team, created by Peter Milligan and Mike Allred, first appears in X-Force #116 and originally assumed the moniker X-Force, taking over for the more traditional superhero team after most of them are seemingly killed in an explosion.  The team chose to take celebrity and become famous, rather than follow the dream of mutant leader, Professor Charles Xavier and would take on any mission as long as the money was right, as well as make money on their own by selling out merchandising rights.\n\nThe title was laced with Milligan's satirical take on the superhero team as well as general cynicism toward the entire genre. Milligan and Allred would regularly play with killing off the title characters.\n\nIncluded are all the appearances of the team and a Doop speak index and for those who want to have the fun of translating it yourselves there's a Doop Translator.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae0376f82905c637b2665c8f38ed795054fd786f","amp;dn":"X-Statix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae0376f82905c637b2665c8f38ed795054fd786f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,3,118,248,41,5,198,55,178,102,92,143,56,237,121,80,84,253,120,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
