In the final stop of his STRIPPED tour, Eddie performs\n to a sold out crowd delighting them with witty observations, social \n commentary and quite a few tangents. In Eddie's own words, the show is\n &quot;about everything that has ever happened...with a few gaps.&quot;  From God and \n politics to history and even Latin, Eddie's genius shines in this tour de \n force performance and Eddie Izzard showcases his true comic genius as only\n he could.\n           \n                \n         \n\n                         Big up all scene massive! \n       \n        \n\n                                                                 \n                            GROUP INFORMATION\n                            \n                  10 Years of the Force and still going strong\n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro/asia sites\n           * Fios/Cable Bluray rippers or Tv cappers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aebba1760128e9ee499630a6939252f9b22d7db9","amp;dn":"Eddie.Izzard.Live.at.Madison.Square.Garden.2011.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aebba1760128e9ee499630a6939252f9b22d7db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,187,161,118,1,40,233,238,73,150,48,166,147,146,82,249,178,45,125,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
