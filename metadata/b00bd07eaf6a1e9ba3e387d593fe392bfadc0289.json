Most of the material on this five-star album was recorded at Rudy Van \n\nGelder's New Jersey studio on December 11, 1961, when Green was joined by tenor titan Ike Quebec, pianist Sonny Clark, bassist Sam \n\nJones, and drummer Louis Hayes.  Tragically, Quebec was near the end of his life -- the distinctive saxman died of lung cancer at the age of \n\n44 on January 16, 1963 -- but there is no evidence of Quebec's declining health on Born to Be Blue.  He was playing as authoritatively as \n\never well into 1962, and the saxman is in fine form on hard-swinging interpretations of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; and Al Jolson's \n\n&quot;Back in Your Own Back Yard.&quot;  It's interesting to hear Quebec playing bop, for his big, breathy tone was right out of swing and was greatly \n\ninfluenced by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster.  Although Quebec and Green (who was 14 years younger) had very different musical \n\nbackgrounds, they were always quite compatible musically.  They clearly enjoyed a strong rapport on the uptempo selections as well as \n\nballads like &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; and Mel Torme's &quot;Born to Be Blue.&quot;  Originally a vinyl LP, this album was reissued on CD in 1989, when \n\nBlue Note added an alternate take of the title song and a previously unreleased version of Charlie Parker's &quot;Cool Blues.&quot; ~ Alex Henderson, \n\nAMG\n\nPersonnel:\nGrant Green (Guitar) \nIke Quebec (Tenor Saxophone) \nSonny Clark (Piano) \nSam Jones (Double Bass) \nLouis Hayes (Drums) \n\nTracks:\n01  Someday My Prince Will Come (Frank Churchill/Larry Morey) 6:30 \n02  Born To Be Blue (Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©/Robert Wells) 4:54 \n03  Born To Be Blue (Alternate Take) (Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©/Robert Wells) 4:41 \n04  If I Should Lose You (Ralph Rainger/Leo Robin) 6:05 \n05  Back In Your Own Back Yard (Dave Dreyer/Al Jolson/Billy Rose) 8:04 \n06  My One And Only Love (Robert Mellin/Guy Wood) 5:50 \n07  Count Every Star (Bruno Coquatrix/Sammy Gallop) 6:21 \n08  Cool Blues (Charlie Parker) 7:57 \n09  Outer Space (Grant Green) 8:43","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00bd07eaf6a1e9ba3e387d593fe392bfadc0289","amp;dn":"Grant+Green+-+Born+to+Be+Blue+%281962%29+%5BBlues%5D%5Bmp+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00bd07eaf6a1e9ba3e387d593fe392bfadc0289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,11,208,126,175,106,30,155,163,227,135,213,147,254,57,43,250,220,2,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
