The one where you and your friends got together to battle the evil dragon? Well, these guys do that. Every night.&quot; \n\n\nWelcome to the world of online raiding. In certain MMORPG's, like Blizzard Entertainment's &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, gaming content is regularly created for the collaborative participation of up to twenty-five players at a time. Each player fulfills a particular role within the collective based on the skills attributed to their class of character in the game. Some play healers, some play damage dealers, and some play characters defensively designed to soak the large amounts of damage dealt by their virtual opponents. These players group together to form raids that routinely meet to test themselves against scripted game encounters. The technical design of these encounters is often so tightly tuned that it requires a remarkable amount of practice and planning for a raid to complete them, and the near flawless performance of each of its members.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The RaidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be a film about raiding and what it means to be a raider. We will capture the numerous hours invested by a diverse group of gamers in a complicated and choreographed digital environment, where every contribution weighs on their success or failure. We will watch, in person and virtually, as members strategize, fail, re-strategize, and inevitably find victory in their pursuits. We will sit with them in their homes and seek to understand the value this kind of commitment has in their daily lives, amidst their work, and within their families. We will question them about virtual achievements and their value. We will sit with social experts concerned about the growing issue of internet addiction and seek their opinions. We will question the future of the MMO experience and its place in the global landscape of culture, education, and business. Most of all, we will demonstrate and feel the excitement and energy of this kind of experience, which is so often criticized and misunderstood. \n\n\nInfo\nVideo\nLength: 45:12\nFrame Width: 1280\nFrame Height: 720\nData rate: 2203kbps\nTotal bitrate: 2335kbps\nFrame rate 29 Frames/second\nAudio\nBit rate 131kbps\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio sample rate: 48kHz\nMpeg-4\nSize 755mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08f3d1678b4be843c552727b0af5cd462d46ef6","amp;dn":"The+Raid+Documentary+%5B2011%5D+Blue+Loon+films+gamebreaker.tv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08f3d1678b4be843c552727b0af5cd462d46ef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,143,61,22,120,180,190,132,60,85,39,39,176,175,92,212,98,212,110,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
