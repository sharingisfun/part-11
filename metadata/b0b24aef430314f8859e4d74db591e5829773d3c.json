All 2,750 entries from the first edition were examined for revision, 1,800 of them remaining essentially unchanged. While entries in both editions are signed, the name of the scholar is followed by the date 1987 in the new edition, thereby indicating the article is reprinted with few or no changes. When entries were updated for the second edition, either by the original author or by another scholar, a single name will be followed by two dates (1987 and 2005) or two names will be listed, each followed by one of the two years. The editors considered some articles from the first edition worthy of inclusion in the second but no longer state-of-the-art (e.g., Mysticism, Rites of passage, Sexuality). Here, the entry is reprinted with the title qualified by &quot;First Edition&quot; and is then followed by a completely new article with the same title but the qualifier &quot;Further Considerations.&quot; Most, if not all, entries conclude with supplemental bibliographies, often updated even if the entry itself was not. When they have been updated, the new citations follow the original bibliography under the heading &quot;New Sources.&quot;\n\n\n** Brought to you by TheNobleWolf **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b24aef430314f8859e4d74db591e5829773d3c","amp;dn":"The+Gale+Encyclopedia+of+Religion+%2815+Volume+Set%29+%E2%99%94TNW%E2%99%9A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b24aef430314f8859e4d74db591e5829773d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,178,74,239,67,3,20,248,133,158,77,116,219,89,30,88,41,119,61,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
