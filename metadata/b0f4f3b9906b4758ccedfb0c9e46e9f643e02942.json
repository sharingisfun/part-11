Battles might be won or lost but our power to fight and keep ourselves alive rested on our struggle to keep control of the Atlantic.&quot; - Sir Winston Churchill\nBy May 1940, Britain was an isolated nation, cut off from the rest of Europe. The Nazi's controlled France and Norway, posing a deadly threat to the southern and eastern shores. Cornered by Hitler, Britain's only hope for survival was to import food, raw materials, and munitions from America. Merchant ships sailing the Atlantic in convoys became the nation's crucial lifeline, one that the Nazi's were determined to break.\nThus began the longest and bloodiest campaign of World War 2. Over four years, 100,000 people died and 2,500 ships were sunk in the Battle of the Atlantic. It brought Britain to the brink of defeat. From the eastern seaboard of the U.S.A. to the west coast of Africa, those who died had no graves - only their names carved on memorials.\nThis four part series unpacks the critical moments of the biggest naval campaign of the 20th Century. Powerful interviews with those who fought in the battle, dramatic archive - some of it in colour, and impressionistic drama reconstructions brings the horrors of the Atlantic war to a new generation.\nDarlow Smithson Productions / Convoy Films Inc. 2009\n\n\n1)  Wolfpack Rising \nAtlantic Ocean - a forgotten front of one of the most brutal battles of the Second World War. In 1940, Britain stands alone against Nazi Germany, relying on Atlantic supply ships to keep her from surrendering. But German U-boats are hunting the convoys, bringing Britain to the edge of defeat. It was a battle of strategies - attack and counterattack, the race to technological supremacy or getting Lady Luck on her side.\n\n2)  The Hunt \nIn 1941, supply ships supporting Britain in the epic struggle against Hitler are being devastated by German U-boats. But slowly, the convoys begin to fight back, turning the hunters into the hunted. Since the beginning of the war the elite crews of German U-boats destroyed more than two and a half million tons of goods, they called it their happy times, but those happy days will soon come to an end. The war changed and the Germans were under threat of defeat.\n\n3)  Brink of Defeat \nDecember 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor finally led the U.S. to enter World War II. Desperate to cripple Britain's shipping lifeline, Hitler's U-boats are sent to North America in 1942, in search of easier prey. The success of their attacks push the Allies to the edge of collapse.\n\n4)  Death Blow \nJanuary 1943, the Battle of the Atlantic is approaching its climax. There are more German U-boats prowling the North Atlantic than ever before. Unless the threat is neutralised, it will be impossible for the Allies to mount the biggest campaign of WWII: D-Day. The allied convoys get the most important mission - they need to carry weapons and soldiers for the invasion of Europe. To stop the convoys Germany invents new weapons and new submarines. It was a desperate war whose purpose was to stop the largest invasion in the history.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/3755/m0sl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/3755/m0sl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6311/zv6o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6311/zv6o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6990/vvzq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6990/vvzq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2307/jlbw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2307/jlbw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/4057/p261.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/4057/p261.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7797/08v9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7797/08v9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/694/s4z7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/694/s4z7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/4108/eb8h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/4108/eb8h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8593/x69d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8593/x69d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/1161/v5mn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/1161/v5mn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/8104/f4n8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/8104/f4n8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2163/fmjr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2163/fmjr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/8756/a5t4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/8756/a5t4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/5063/6nqb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/5063/6nqb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/3549/wv9e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/3549/wv9e.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/8031/5nx7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/8031/5nx7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7830111f1038344b5649&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3 329 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrames Per Second: 25.000 fps\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46mn 59s\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.09 GB\nSource: HDTV\nRipped by: DiCH\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f4f3b9906b4758ccedfb0c9e46e9f643e02942","amp;dn":"NG+Convoy+War+For+The+Atlantic+4of4+Death+Blow+720p+x264+AC3+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f4f3b9906b4758ccedfb0c9e46e9f643e02942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,244,243,185,144,107,71,88,204,237,251,12,158,70,233,246,67,224,41,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
