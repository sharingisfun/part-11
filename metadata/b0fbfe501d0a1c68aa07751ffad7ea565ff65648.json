The program also explores how Einstein's professional discovery rested on the foundational research of three of his contemporaries, all tragic figures - Lise Meitner, Antoine Lavoisier, and Michael Faraday - and how each individual's work, in turn, embodied one further step toward nuclear power.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0fbfe501d0a1c68aa07751ffad7ea565ff65648","amp;dn":"Einstein%5C%27s+Big+Idea++%28Nova%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0fbfe501d0a1c68aa07751ffad7ea565ff65648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,251,254,80,29,10,28,104,170,7,117,31,250,215,234,86,95,246,86,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
