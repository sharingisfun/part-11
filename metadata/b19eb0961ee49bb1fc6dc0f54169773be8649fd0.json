The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it\\'s genuine.\n \n\nFeatures\n  \n  Can be run as a standalone application\n  Works well with all system languages\n  Custom OEM information can be installed\n  Argument support for silent installs\n  Can be used for pre-activation\n  Application integrity checking\n  Custom error handling\n  Support for hidden partitions and complex setups\n  Can work alongside Linux\\'s GRUB or any other boot manager\n  Works with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption aplications\n  Add your own certificates and serials externally\n  Offers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1\n  Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)\n\nApplication integrity checking?\n \nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\n \nNote: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it\\'s worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n \n\nVirus scanner results\n \nAll virus scanner detection\\'s are a false-positive. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n \nVersion 2.0.6 (08/21/2011)\n   \n   Added a new GRLDR version\n   Fixed the ignore existing SLIC option\n   Added Stone Home Premium serial\n   Added Itautec Home Basic serial\n   Added Stone and Itautec SLIC's and certificates\n   Cleaned up serials for all Windows Server editions\n   Other minor tweaks and fixes\n  \n\nWindows.7.Loader.v2.0.6-DAZ(32Bit-64Bit)\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b19eb0961ee49bb1fc6dc0f54169773be8649fd0","amp;dn":"Windows.7.Loader.v2.0.6-DAZ%2832Bit-64Bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b19eb0961ee49bb1fc6dc0f54169773be8649fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,158,176,150,30,228,155,177,252,109,192,245,65,105,119,59,232,100,159,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
