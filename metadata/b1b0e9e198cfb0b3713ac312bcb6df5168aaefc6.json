The lead single &quot;Run, Baby, Run&quot; was not particularly successful. However, the album gained attention after the success of the third single, &quot;All I Wanna Do,&quot; based on the Wyn Cooper poem &quot;Fun&quot; and co-written by David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Sheryl Crow, and Kevin Gilbert. The single eventually reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, propelling the album to number three in the US Billboard 200 album charts, selling over 5.3 million units there as of January 2008. On the UK Album Chart, Tuesday Night Music Club reached #8. It is listed as one of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\n\nAmazon.com Review By Rickey Wright - Sheryl Crow's proper debut--an earlier, slicker record was scrapped in favor of Tuesday Night--occasionally reaches too far in attempting Significance, as when the album opens by name-checking Aldous Huxley. Usually, though, Crow and her band of L.A. session and singer/songwriter collaborators strike just the right tone. The &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; homage of &quot;All I Wanna Do,&quot; the clanking guitar riff of &quot;Can't Cry Anymore,&quot; and the funky threat of &quot;What I Can Do for You&quot; meld perfectly with the lyrics, resulting in a peak of mainstream pop-rock.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Run, Baby, Run\n[02] Leaving Las Vegas\n[03] Strong Enough\n[04] Can't Cry Anymore\n[05] Solidify\n[06] The Na-Na Song\n[07] No One Said It Would Be Easy\n[08] What I Can Do For You\n[09] All I Wanna Do\n[10] We Do What We Can\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:49m:42s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 120mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.0..20 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 03 August 1993\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com \n&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow \n&gt;\n&gt;[All I Wanna Do]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b0e9e198cfb0b3713ac312bcb6df5168aaefc6","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+Tuesday+Night+Music+Club+-+Sheryl+Crow+120mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b0e9e198cfb0b3713ac312bcb6df5168aaefc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,176,233,225,152,207,176,179,113,58,195,18,188,182,223,81,104,170,239,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
