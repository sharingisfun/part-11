Some of the tracks were dropped and replaced by other tracks that more accurately represent Boston's history. The tracks added to this set are &quot;I Had A Good Time&quot; form Boston's last album &quot;Corporate America&quot; and this song is by far the only real classic Boston track from that album and is a very welcome addition. The other added track is from the &quot;Walk On&quot; album, &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;. Though it doesn't feature Boston's long time lead vocalist, Brad Delp, it has a classic Boston sound and really keeps this set rockin'. Another change is none of the songs bleed\ninto each other. On the original version &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; faded into &quot;Cool The Engines&quot;. Now both of these tracks stand on their own.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.I had A good time                                    [04:16]\n02.Higher power                                         [05:05]\n03.More than A feeling                                  [04:45]\n04.Peace of mind                                        [05:01]\n05.Don't look back                                      [06:04]\n06.I need your love                                     [05:23]\n07.Cool the engines                                     [04:37]\n08.Party                                                [04:07]\n09.Feelin' satisfied                                    [04:11]\n10.Foreplay , long time                                 [07:49]\n11.Amanda                                               [04:18]\n12.Rock &amp; roll band                                     [03:00]\n13.Smokin'                                              [04:24]\n14.A man i'll never be                                  [06:40]\n15.The star spangled banner , 4th of july reprise       [02:43]\n____\n\n72:23 min\n116,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
