But when ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello- her former nemesis- she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding electrocution or, worse, falling in love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b263c50b2631565a3f0608fa75c5bb9e545ec68c","amp;dn":"Friends+Without+Benefits+%28Knitting+in+the+City%2C+%232%29+-+Penny+Reid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b263c50b2631565a3f0608fa75c5bb9e545ec68c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,99,197,11,38,49,86,90,63,6,8,250,117,197,187,158,84,94,198,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
