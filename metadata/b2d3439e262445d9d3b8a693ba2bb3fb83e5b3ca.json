After second album Super Tight..., UGK hit the R&amp;B charts with 1996's Ridin' Dirty, which ascended to the number two spot. Dirty Money followed in late 2001. Pimp C began serving at three-year jail sentence in early 2002, putting UGK on ice until 2007, when the double album Underground Kingz appeared.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Intro\n02.One Day\n03.Murder\n04.Pinky Ring\n05.Diamonds &amp; Wood\n06.3 In The Mornin'\n07.Touched (Feat. 3-2)\n08.Fuck My Car\n09.That's Why I Carry (Feat.
