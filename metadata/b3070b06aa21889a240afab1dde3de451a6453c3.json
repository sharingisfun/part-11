A static machine theory of order that sees humans, and    \n  everything else on the planet, as components, cogs in a system. But   \n  in an age disillusioned with politics, the self-regulating ecosystem  \n  has become the model for utopian ideas of human &quot;self-organising      \n  networks&quot;  dreams of new ways of organising societies without        \n  leaders, as in the Facebook and Twitter revolutions, and in global    \n  visions of connectivity like the Gaia theory.                         \n                                                                        \n  This powerful idea emerged out of the hippie communes in America in   \n  the 1960s, and from counterculture computer scientists who believed   \n  that global webs of computers could liberate the world. At the very   \n  moment this was happening, the science of ecology discovered that     \n  the theory of the self-regulating ecosystem wasnt true. Instead      \n  they found that nature was really dynamic and constantly changing in  \n  unpredictable ways. But the dream of the self-organising network had  \n  by now captured our imaginations.                                     \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                                                        \n  Grace_%28television_documentary_series%29                             \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&lt;/a&gt;                              \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e89fdc8e8b9a8d9fa88f85898184c68b8785&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3070b06aa21889a240afab1dde3de451a6453c3","amp;dn":"All.Watched.Over.By.Machines.Of.Loving.Grace.Part2.WEBRip.XviD-W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3070b06aa21889a240afab1dde3de451a6453c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,7,11,6,170,33,136,154,36,10,250,177,221,227,222,69,26,100,83,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
