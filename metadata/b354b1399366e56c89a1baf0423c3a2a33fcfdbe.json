Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers). \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tLilith\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Come My Way (Version 1)\n02.Jabberwock\n03.Portland Town\n04.House Of The Rising Sun (Version 2)\n05.Spanish Is A Loving Tongue\n06.Fare Thee Well\n07.Lonesome Travellers\n08.Down In The Salley Garden\n09.Mary  Ann\n10.Full Fathom Five\n11.Four Strong Winds\n12.Black Girl\n13.Once I Had A Sweetheart\n14.Bells Of Freedom\n15.Blowin' In The Wind\n16.Et Maintenant (What Now My Love)\n17.That's Right Baby\n18.Sister Morphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                      ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b354b1399366e56c89a1baf0423c3a2a33fcfdbe","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+Come+My+Way+%281965%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b354b1399366e56c89a1baf0423c3a2a33fcfdbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,84,177,57,147,102,229,108,137,161,186,240,66,60,58,42,51,252,253,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
