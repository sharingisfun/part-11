He uses the sign test to introduce inferential statistics, empirically derived sampling distributions, many visual aids and lots of interesting examples to promote student understanding. One of the hallmarks of this text is the positive feedback from students-even students who are not mathematically inclined praise the text for its clarity, detailed presentation, and use of humor to help make concepts accessible and memorable. Thorough explanations precede the introduction of every formula-and the exercises that immediately follow include a step-by-step model that lets students compare their work against fully solved examples. This combination makes the text perfect for students taking their first statistics course in psychology or other social and behavioral sciences.\n\n# Hardcover: 599 pages\n# Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 9 edition (December 31, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495596523\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495596523","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b36e230049bc72c96b532e2bf9a48fb29774afbb","amp;dn":"Understanding+Statistics+in+the+Behavioral+Sciences%2C9th+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b36e230049bc72c96b532e2bf9a48fb29774afbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,110,35,0,73,188,114,201,107,83,46,43,249,164,143,178,151,116,175,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
