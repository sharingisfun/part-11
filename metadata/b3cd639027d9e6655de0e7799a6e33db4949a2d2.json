Finkelstein cuts through the fog with indisputable historical facts, optimistic that the struggle is winnable, and that it is simply an issue of justice.\n\nNorman Finkelstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953. He is the son of two Holocaust survivors. He received his doctorate from Princeton University for a thesis on the theory of Zionism. He is the author of four books, including The Holocaust Industry. His writings have also appeared in many prestigious journals. Currently he teaches political science at DePaul University in Chicago.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:18:51\n\n\n1  The Jewish Question And The Zionist Movement\n2  Arab Antagonism To Zionism\n3  Population Expulsion &amp; Western European Elite Opinion\n4  Zionism, Conquest, &amp; Elite Western European Values\n5  1948 &amp; The Expulsion Of The Indigenous Population Of Palestine\n6  The 'Two State' Settlement &amp; International Opinion\n7  Foiling The PLO's Peace Offensive, The First Intifada, And Oslo\n8  Arafat The Terrorist, The Saudi Peace Plan &amp; The Second Intifada\n9  The Big Stick, Operation Defensive Shield &amp; War Crimes\n10 The War, Concentration Camps &amp; The Holocaust\n11 Communism &amp; The Moral Decision Of The Two State Solution\n12 An Issue Of Justice\n13 The New Technology, Research, And Alan Dershowitz\n14 American Jews, Anti-Semitism, Influence &amp; Israel\n15 Works In Progress\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tradebit.com/usr/mp3-album/pub/9002/487/487567/48756781.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tradebit.com/usr/mp3-album/pub/9002/487/487567/48756781.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3cd639027d9e6655de0e7799a6e33db4949a2d2","amp;dn":"Norman+Finkelstein+-+An+Issue+of+Justice+-+Origins+of+the+Israel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3cd639027d9e6655de0e7799a6e33db4949a2d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,205,99,144,39,217,230,101,93,224,231,121,154,110,51,219,73,73,162,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
