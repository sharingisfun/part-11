As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange \n\nstory but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past.\n\nIn his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Roland is sent by his father to \n\ninvestigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a Ã¢â‚¬Å“skin-manÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of \n\nBill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager \n\nhimself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trials by reciting a story from the Magic Tales of the Eld \n\nthat his mother often read to him at bedtime. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never too old for stories,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Roland says to Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Man and boy, girl and \n\nwoman, never too old. We live for them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless \n\ntreasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.\n\nKing began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last \n\nthree novels were published in 2003 and 2004. The Wind Through the Keyhole is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic. \n\nBut this novel also stands on its own for all readers, an enchanting and haunting journey to RolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world and testimony to the \n\npower of Stephen KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storytelling magic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d5f8fa0dbf7fe4febcbbb21c95f9c0ce26224a","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Tower+Book+8%3A+Wind+through+the+Keyhole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d5f8fa0dbf7fe4febcbbb21c95f9c0ce26224a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,213,248,250,13,191,127,228,254,188,187,178,28,149,249,192,206,38,34,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
