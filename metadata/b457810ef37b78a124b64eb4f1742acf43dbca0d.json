This book describes such injury to the spine. Packed with illustrations and photographs, including advanced imaging (CT scan and MRI) of sections of the spine and pelvis, the atlas makes it easy to recognize the characteristic patterns of subluxations. The common types of changes that occur in the structures of the spine have been classified, documented, and arranged in the order of progressive severity of dislocation and degeneration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b457810ef37b78a124b64eb4f1742acf43dbca0d","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Common+Subluxations+of+the+Human+Spine+%26amp%3B+Pelvis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b457810ef37b78a124b64eb4f1742acf43dbca0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,87,129,14,243,123,120,161,36,182,78,180,241,116,42,207,67,219,202,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
