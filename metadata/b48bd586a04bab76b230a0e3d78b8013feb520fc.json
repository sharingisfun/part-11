Some have a beating geological heart, others are frozen in time. Brian travels to the tallest mountain on Earth, the volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii, to show how something as basic as a planet's size can make the difference between life and death. Even on the summit of this volcano, Brian would stand in the shade of the tallest mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on Mars called Olympus Mons, which rises up 27 km. Yet the fifth wonder in the series isn't on a planet at all. It's on a tiny moon of Jupiter. The discoveries made on Io have been astonishing. This fragment of rock should be cold and dead, yet, with the volcanic landscape of eastern Ethiopia as a backdrop, Brian reveals why Io is home to extraordinary lakes of lava and giant volcanic plumes that erupt 500 km into the sky.\n\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 9256 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1440x1080 displayed at 1920x1080\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 50FPS\nNumber of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 3.76 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nThis is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.\nYou'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.\nThese have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.\nIf you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.\nIf you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.\nThe ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.\n\nRelease schedule for 1080:\nPart 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5491759\nPart 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494870\nPart 3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5497916\nPart 4: This is it\nPart 5: 20th April\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48bd586a04bab76b230a0e3d78b8013feb520fc","amp;dn":"BBC+Wonders+of+the+Solar+System+4of5+1080i+HDTV+h264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48bd586a04bab76b230a0e3d78b8013feb520fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,139,213,134,160,75,171,118,178,48,160,227,215,139,128,19,254,181,32,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
