Lytton was the linchpin of a life in which friendships, making a home and her\nown artistic output jockeyed for attention. The association with Lytton Strachey and\nhis Bloomsbury friends, combined with her own modesty, have tended to overshadow\nCarrington's contribution to modem painting, but Jane Hill's important study goes a\nlong way to redress the balance. The author takes a chronological viewpoint, looking at the art Carrington produced in each period and the influences upon it of personal\nrelationships, places, and current events and trends. The immense range of her art -\nportraits, landscapes, glass paintings and decorative work - reveal Carrington as a\nsignificant artist of her period.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49c68ffe6a46cc7444d01caad6acd94bfee1c97","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Dora+Carrington+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49c68ffe6a46cc7444d01caad6acd94bfee1c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,156,104,255,230,164,108,199,68,77,1,202,173,106,205,148,191,238,28,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
