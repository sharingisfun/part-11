The CD in this package was missing two songs that were on the video (&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;), due to space limitations.\n\nIt was directed and edited by Steve Harris, Iron Maiden founder and bassist.[3]\n\nIn 2012, Iron Maiden undertook their Maiden England World Tour, which is largely based around the original video in setlist and stage design.[4] A re-issue of the concert film itself was first mentioned by Iron Maiden in September 2007, with a release date set for 2008, but was later delayed.[5] In an interview with German magazine Rock Hard in August 2012, bassist Steve Harris confirmed that Maiden England will be re-released in 2013, with the concert footage expanded to comprise the show's encores which were not included in the original VHS.[6] On 12 February 2013, Iron Maiden announced that Maiden England would be re-released on DVD, CD and picture disc on 25 March 2013 under the title Maiden England '88. Along with the aforementioned encores, the new video will also include the third part of the &quot;History of Iron Maiden&quot; documentary series (continuing from 2004's The Early Days and 2008's Live After Death re-issue) as well as promo videos and the 1987 documentary 12 Wasted Years.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\n1    &quot;Moonchild&quot; \n2    &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; \n3    &quot;The Prisoner&quot; \n4    &quot;Still Life&quot; \n5    &quot;Die with Your Boots On&quot; \n6    &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;\n7    &quot;Killers&quot; \n8    &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; \n9    &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;\n10   &quot;Wasted Years&quot;\n11   &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;\n12   &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;\n13   &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;\n14   &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;\n15   &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;\n16   &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;\n17   &quot;Running Free&quot; \n18   &quot;Sanctuary&quot; \n\nEnjoy this awesome release from Iron Maiden, this is a classic and a must have for all Maiden Fans and please at least buy one of the two The DVD or the CD to support the band they deserve it.\n\nUP THE IRONS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52bdc95645d644ecf1b2a9db2bd6ae76ba1afa2","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+Maiden+England+%2788+Remastered+2013+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52bdc95645d644ecf1b2a9db2bd6ae76ba1afa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,43,220,149,100,93,100,78,207,27,42,157,178,189,106,231,107,161,175,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
