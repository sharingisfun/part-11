Youâ€™re in control as you work to create a functioning ecosystem from the ground up, problem solving to learn life science principles. Tyto Ecology, an ecology simulation game, teaches Next Generation Science Standards to learners in a fun and innovative way! \r\n\r\nThis is a calm, slow-paced game (at least until things start going wrong) that encourages learning through experimentation as you work to sustain, or destroy, life. Up to three months of time can pass while you are away, so you come back to changes in your ecosystem and potentially several problems to handle each time you return to the game. \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\nBuild and create your own self-sustaining ecosystem \r\nOver 70 animals and plants to customize your biodomes \r\nUse the data tool's map to monitor your ecosystem \r\nEarn achievements by completing ecological challenges \r\nSandbox game with hours of replayability \r\nUse Photo Mode to capture the perfect moment \r\nEducational gameplay that fits with Middle and High School Next Generation Science Standards\r\nAbout the Ecosystem\r\nTyto Ecology is not just another building game or something where the player's actions don't have meaning and consequence. In order to master the game, the player is mastering life science principles. \r\n\r\nThe ecosystem begins with producers, plants that are the basis of each biome, with plants regenerate leaves that are eaten by animals (depending on how healthy they are). The plants have vegetative, flowering, and/or fruiting reproduction cycles, including a need for pollinators in order to successfully pass through the blooming phase, and animals must eat fruit in order for the most possible amount of seeds to germinate and begin. Next come the consumers: herbivores, insectivores, predators, scavengers, and omnivores. \r\n\r\nThese animals live and breed in territories over time, eating their appropriate food, and in many cases becoming food. Some plants and animals are poisonous or tough (like tortoises), limiting which animals can eat them! In addition to managing all this over many different species, each plant and animal creates detritus over time, and decomposers must be used in order to complete the cycle of life! If detritus builds up, poop, bones, and debris will begin to appear in your ecosystem and the health of everything in it will be reduced.\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nWindows Mac OS X\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7 or higher (64-bit only) \r\nProcessor: 4th Generation i3 or higher \r\nMemory: 6 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Intel HD 5000 or higher \r\nStorage: 840 MB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b541708ae0de1f94d054a99a4bd8ba92183871f9","amp;dn":"TytoEcology+v1.10u1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b541708ae0de1f94d054a99a4bd8ba92183871f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,65,112,138,224,222,31,148,208,84,169,154,75,216,186,146,24,56,113,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
