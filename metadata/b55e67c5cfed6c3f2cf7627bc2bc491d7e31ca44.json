Illustrating her analysis with hundreds of current advertising examples from mainstream and trade sources, Kilbourne presents a compelling argument that these cynical industries have a clear and deep understanding of the psychology of addiction -- an understanding they exploit to create and feed a life-threatening dependency on their products.\n\nDeadly Persuasion casts a critical eye on the corporate interests that lie behind the industries whose products kill more than 450,000 Americans each year.\n\nSections: The Advertising of Tobacco | The Advertising of Alcohol | Fighting Back","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b55e67c5cfed6c3f2cf7627bc2bc491d7e31ca44","amp;dn":"Deadly+Persuasion+-+The+Advertising+of+Alcohol+%26amp%3B+Tobacco+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b55e67c5cfed6c3f2cf7627bc2bc491d7e31ca44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,94,103,197,207,237,108,63,44,247,98,123,194,188,73,29,126,49,202,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
