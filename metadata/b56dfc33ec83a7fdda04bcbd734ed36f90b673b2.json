With the help of his roommate Samantha and a lawyer named Ron, Jack forms a group of six &quot;macho men&quot; from his Greenwich Village neighborhood and the rest of the film details their rise to fame from New York City to a climatic concert in San Francisco.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 344x248 - 29.97fps - 1h 58mn 20s 260ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56dfc33ec83a7fdda04bcbd734ed36f90b673b2","amp;dn":"Can%27t+Stop+the+Music+%5B1980%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56dfc33ec83a7fdda04bcbd734ed36f90b673b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,109,252,51,236,131,167,253,218,4,188,189,115,78,211,111,144,182,115,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
