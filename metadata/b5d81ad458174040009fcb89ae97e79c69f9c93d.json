There are so many recognizable artists like Eminem with his track entitled ?Any Man? which was one of the only reasons I purchased this Compact Disc. \n\nThe entire content of this CD cannot be compared to any other assemblage of any genre of music to my appreciative.\n\nRespect this compact disc content.  \n\nThere was a Soundbombing volume 1 and 3, but they don?t compare to this release by any means. \n\nIf you assembled the contents of volumes 1 and 3 and singled out tracks to make a single compilation to challenge Soundbombing 2, you wouldn?t come close to the musical entertainment factors released by the energy of Soundbombing 2.\n\nKeep fit and have fun! ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d81ad458174040009fcb89ae97e79c69f9c93d","amp;dn":"Rawkus+Presents+-+Soundbombing+II+%5B1999%5D+%28Hip-Hop%2FRap%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d81ad458174040009fcb89ae97e79c69f9c93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,216,26,212,88,23,64,64,0,159,203,137,174,151,231,156,105,249,201,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
