As a Delta troop commander, he helped author the operation to hunt and kill Bin Laden. He told his tale of that mission in the book Kill Bin Laden, which went on to become a national bestseller. His first novel, Black Site, was published in February of 2012.\n\nDelta Force series:\n\nBlack Site (#1): After September 11, 2001, Delta Force troop commander Dalton Fury was given the secret mission to hunt down and kill the most wanted man in the world, the details of which were recounted in his extraordinary New York Times bestseller Kill Bin Laden. Now, Fury draws upon his hard-won combat experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and his gift for true-to-life storytellingÃ¢â‚¬â€to offer a brand-new series of thrillers that are as close to reality as readers can get.\n\nMeet Kolt Raynor. A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and dutyÃ¢â‚¬â€after a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey ordersÃ¢â‚¬â€one that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But RaynorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shot at redemption comes at a price.\n\nA shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home. What Raynor never expected was to uncover a sinister al Qaeda plot to capture a Black Site--a secret U.S.Ã‚Â­Ã‚Â­ prison--and destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trailÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and he will stop at nothing to make sure that RaynorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission is not accomplished.\n\nTier One Wild (#2): Former disgraced Delta Force commander Kolt &quot;Racer&quot; Raynor has earned his way back into The Unit after redeeming himself during an explosive operation at a black site in Pakistan. But he is about to face his deadliest challenge yet.\n\nThe most wanted man in the world, American al Qaeda commander Daoud al Amriki, and his handpicked team of terrorist operatives, have acquired stores of Russian-built, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles (SAM's) from ex-Libyan spies in Cairo. Their mission: infiltrate the United States and take down American aircraft. The country's best are tasked with stopping them. But when a SEAL Team Six mission to take down al Amriki goes wrong, Major Raynor and his Delta Force team find themselves front and center as Amriki and his terrorists work their way closer to America. And time is running out.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
