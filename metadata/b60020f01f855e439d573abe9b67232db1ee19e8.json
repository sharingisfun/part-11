Many books purporting to cover motor control have veered off course to examine biomechanics and physiology rather than actual control, leaving a gap in the literature. This book covers all the major perspectives in motor control, with a balanced approach. There are chapters explicitly dedicated to control theory, to dynamical systems, to biomechanics, to different behaviors, and to motor learning, including case studies.\n\nReviews current research in motor control\nContains balanced perspectives among neuroscience, psychology, physics and biomechanics\nHighlights controversies in the field\nDiscusses neurophysiology, control theory, biomechanics, and dynamical systems under one cover\nLinks principles of motor control to everyday behaviors\nIncludes case studies delving into topics in more detail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b60020f01f855e439d573abe9b67232db1ee19e8","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Motor+Control-+Latash+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b60020f01f855e439d573abe9b67232db1ee19e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,0,32,240,31,133,94,67,157,87,58,190,155,103,35,45,177,238,25,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
