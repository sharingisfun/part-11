Storm Front reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts for one week and went 4x Platinum. Six of the songs reached the billboard charts. We Didn't Start the Fire reached number one in four different categories. Okay this is not typical Billy Joel; this is more like an experimental cassette. Gone is most of his soft rock and easy listening and the piano is not included in all songs. Still this is a pretty good cassette. Storm Front by Billy Joel gets an AAA+++.\n\nSide One\n\nThat's Not Her Style\n#77 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles\n#18 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks\nWe Didn't Start the Fire\n#1 U.S. Billboard ARC Weekly Top 40 (two weeks at #1)\n#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles (two weeks at #1)\n#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Airplay\n#5 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles\n#6 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks\n#1 U.S. Cash Box Magazine Top Singles\nThe Downeaster 'Alexa'\n#57 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles\n#18 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles\n#33 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks\nI Go To Extremes\n#6 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles\n#4 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles\n#10 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks\nShameless\n#40 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles\n\nSide Two\n\nStorm Front\nLenningrad\nDid not chart\nState of Grace\nWhen In Rome\nAnd So It Goes\n#37 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles\n#5 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles\n#57 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Airplay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b613c158be21bd8e81298640b653c88f0a8fab41","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+Storm+Front+320cbr+1989+Original+CDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b613c158be21bd8e81298640b653c88f0a8fab41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,19,193,88,190,33,189,142,129,41,134,64,182,83,200,143,10,143,171,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
