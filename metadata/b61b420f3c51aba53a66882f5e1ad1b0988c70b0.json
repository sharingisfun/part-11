One name is common to them all: Georges Schwizgebel, one of the most influential and respected directors of contemporary animation. The Swiss filmmaker's style is very much his own: a few deft brushstrokes suffice to depict a character, create an atmosphere or construct a world. Schwizgebel is a meticulous craftsman who also possesses a remarkable feeling for the dramatic, suggesting grandeur with minimal means and an extraordinary economy of lines. His films, often inspired by musical structures, embrace all the arts - architecture, theatre, dance, literature, painting - and form a unique, coherent body of work with the imprint of the artist's wide-ranging mind.\n\nlanguage: none\nsubtitles: not needed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61b420f3c51aba53a66882f5e1ad1b0988c70b0","amp;dn":"The+films+of+Georges+Schwizgebel+%281974-2004%29+%2B+Jeu+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61b420f3c51aba53a66882f5e1ad1b0988c70b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,27,66,15,60,81,171,165,58,102,136,47,94,26,209,176,152,140,112,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
