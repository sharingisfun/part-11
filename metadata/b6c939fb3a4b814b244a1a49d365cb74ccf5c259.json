The tutorial will start by first looking at how to concept the image and research what options we'll have available, prepare the image for camera mapping in CINEMA 4D, model, texture and light 3D geometry to project into the 2D plate, create dynamic simulations to match the shot's vision and then finally bring it all together to create a seamless final shot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c939fb3a4b814b244a1a49d365cb74ccf5c259","amp;dn":"DigitalTutors+-+Bringing+a+Still+Image+to+Life+Using+Projection+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c939fb3a4b814b244a1a49d365cb74ccf5c259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,201,57,251,58,75,129,75,36,74,26,73,211,101,203,116,204,245,194,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
