Included is an workable replacement panel. This plane will not display license alert when starting FSX if installed properly. It is not perfect, No VC, no lights and possible other animations. I know the gear works and the turbines rotate. Sound seems right but the sound cfg file references sounds that aren't included. I believe it is actually a Level-D problem but the sounds are easy to find and swap if you must. I copied most from PMDG MD-11.\n\nThanks to all who came before this humble effort to return. Oh ya, this is my first, so if I did something wrong, sorry!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72a0d98a26491be72f4983541be759a80d40a2f","amp;dn":"Level-D+B767+for+FSX.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72a0d98a26491be72f4983541be759a80d40a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,42,13,152,162,100,145,190,114,244,152,53,65,190,117,154,128,212,10,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
