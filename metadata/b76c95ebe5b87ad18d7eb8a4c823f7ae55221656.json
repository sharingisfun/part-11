Internet Security provides complete antivirus, anti-spyware, antispam, and firewall protection, complemented by remote assistance options, a software updater, and avast! SafeZoneÃ¢â€žÂ¢, built specifically for online shopping and banking threats youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter in 2013.\nMake sure your identity stays yours alone\n\nOur built-in silent firewall blocks hackers and other unauthorized entry attempts to steal sensitive personal data from your PC. Plus, email spam and phishing attacks are prevented with built-in anti-spam.\nShop and bank online without worry\n\nSafeZoneÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is a private and isolated virtual window on your desktop, for securing your sensitive financial transactions online. Perfect for auction sites, buying tickets, booking hotels or airlines, online gaming, or any sort of monetary transfer.\nSurf and socialize without worry\n\nSandbox lets you surf the web and run even risky programs virtually, outside your PC. And our Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on social networks (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) and online dating sites, IM chats (e.g. Skype or ICQ), or peer-to-peer file-sharing sites.\nBenefit from real-time protection\n\nHybrid cloud technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known to our Virus Lab.\nKnow whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming before you click\n\nOur cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on millions of files, so we can warn you of a fileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation before you open it.\nManage avast! on all your devices\n\nYour AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for all your avast! related data, for all your desktop and mobile devices. Each month, we also prepare for you a Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details (e.g. number of infected sites blocked).\nGet help from a Ã¢â‚¬ËœGeekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in your network\n\nOur Remote Assistance lets you connect remotely to friends or family members for computer help. It routes through AVASTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated by either party at any time.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img16/3842/kutp.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img16/3842/kutp.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/6573/3q3v.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/6573/3q3v.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nLees instructies.txt hoe je moet activeren/installeren!\n\n\nDeze software wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.\nVoor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series, games etc\nga dan eens naar http://www.hetmultimediacafe.be/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76c95ebe5b87ad18d7eb8a4c823f7ae55221656","amp;dn":"Avast%21+Internet+Security+8.0.1489+%2B+Keys+%2B+Patch+-+DutchReleaseT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76c95ebe5b87ad18d7eb8a4c823f7ae55221656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,108,149,235,229,184,122,209,141,126,184,164,200,35,247,174,85,34,22,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
