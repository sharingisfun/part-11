Christine (Virginie Ledoyen) and Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) are 16-year-old lovers who have become frustrated with the aloofness of their families and the general monotony of their lives. When the pair are caught shoplifting, Christine's father ships her off to a home for emotionally disturbed children, temporarily putting space between her and Gilles. Luckily for them, though, she escapes and the couple contemplate running away together. For her performance, Ledoyen was nominated for Most Promising Actress at the 1995 CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Awards. ~ Matthew Tobey, All Movie Guide\n\nDuration: 1:30:32\nLanguage: French\nSubs: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77cd0eaf8a21c502bf02f9379b09f2445d0d59c","amp;dn":"L%5C%27Eau+Froide+%28Cold+Water%29+Olivier+Assayas+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77cd0eaf8a21c502bf02f9379b09f2445d0d59c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,124,208,234,248,162,28,80,43,240,47,147,121,176,159,36,69,208,213,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
