Keith Emerson\n\nalso used the lowly spinet so who am I to judge?  They both worked musical\n\nmagic with these fragile organs.\n\n\nThe &quot;noise floor&quot; on vinyl varies from disc to disc.  Hence LO-FI\n\nFisher crafted some very melodic, even pretty music but it could have an\n\nedge.  His vocals were layered.....the same technique used to make Karen\n\nCarpenter's vocals sound thick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b788ee2aefd9105125cac576fff0d3b6e81ffe4f","amp;dn":"MATTHEW+FISHER+%281973-74%29+Early+Works+%2F+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b788ee2aefd9105125cac576fff0d3b6e81ffe4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,136,238,42,239,217,16,81,37,202,197,118,255,240,211,182,232,31,254,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
