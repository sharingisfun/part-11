Van Helsing finds a land still mired in past, where legendary creatures of darkness come to life. A place ruled over by the evil, seductive and unbeatable vampire, Count Dracula. It is Dracula that Van Helsing has been sent to terminate. Anna Valerious is one of the last of a powerful royal family, now nearly annihilated by Dracula. A fearless hunter in her own right, Anna is bent on avenging her ancestors and ending an ancient curse by killing the vampire. Joined by a common foe, Van Helsing and Anna set out to destroy Dracula along with his empire of fear. But in challenging an enemy who never dies, Van Helsing uncovers a secret he never imagined and comes face-to-face with the unresolved mysteries of his own enshrouded past. \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/9899/vlcsnap2011011312h25m08.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/9899/vlcsnap2011011312h25m08.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/3766/vlcsnap2011011312h25m03.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/3766/vlcsnap2011011312h25m03.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b799ce0d8e9c04cc137589b588561ce9194590a4","amp;dn":"Van+Helsing+%282004%29+m-HD+500MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b799ce0d8e9c04cc137589b588561ce9194590a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,153,206,13,142,156,4,204,19,117,137,181,136,86,28,233,25,69,144,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
