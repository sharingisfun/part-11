It is of little surprise that the two complementary players (who had both been with the Oscar Peterson Trio at different times in the 1950s) work together quite well.  With fine support from bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Jake Hanna, Kessel and Ellis (both generally easy to identify) swing their way through some mostly little-played standards, including &quot;Early Autumn&quot; and &quot;Dearly Beloved,&quot; plus a few originals by the co-leaders.  Fans of the bop guitar will want this sprightly collaboration. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nBarney Kessel (Guitar) \nHerb Ellis (Guitar) \nMonty Budwig (Double Bass) \nJake Hanna (Drums) \n\nBarney Kessel &amp; Herb Ellis - Poor Butterfly Tracks:\n01  Dearly Beloved (Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer) 3:24 \n02  Monsieur Armand (Dan Kessel/David Kessel) 4:24 \n03  Poor Butterfly (John Golden/Raymond Hubbell) 3:49 \n04  Make Someone Happy (Betty Comden/Adolp Green/Jule Styne) 8:37 \n05  Early Autumn (Woody Herman/Ralph Burns) 4:39 \n06  Hello (Herb Ellis) 3:34 \n07  Blueberry Hill (Al Lewis/Larry Stock/Vincent Rose) 3:09 \n08  I'm Lover (Herb Ellis) 5:15 \n09  Brigitte (Betty Jane Barker) 5:45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b6b694f2c6e829fc64a2608306af40a91d35d6","amp;dn":"Barney+Kessel+%26+Herb+Ellis+-+Poor+Butterfly+%281977%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bm3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b6b694f2c6e829fc64a2608306af40a91d35d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,182,182,148,242,198,232,41,252,100,162,96,131,6,175,64,169,29,53,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
