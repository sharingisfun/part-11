The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework.\n\nIronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.\n\nIronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more.\n\nIronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f343f0c297e07e5b4913dc21e8511dc094e7b1","amp;dn":"IronPython+in+Action+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f343f0c297e07e5b4913dc21e8511dc094e7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,243,67,240,194,151,224,126,91,73,19,220,33,232,81,29,192,148,231,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
