It's a huge jump from the last version I uploaded as such I don't have a definite changelog from the previous version. However if you are curious as to what changed I encourage you to check out the developers blog here : http://bluebottlegames.com/main/\n\nAlso I changed the format from last time. As I originally packaged the game in a zip file I realized that 7zip would be the most efficient. I realize that not everyone has 7zip so I created a self-extracting executable which will unpackage the game files for you. It is created with 7zip and has not been modified in anyway. I hope you all enjoy and if you have any questions throw a comment and I'll try to get back you.\n\nThanks,\n\n-AppRipper\n\n*End Preface*\n \n \nNEO Scavenger\n(c) Blue Bottle Games\n\nRelease date: 9/10/2014 \nProtection: DRM-Free\nLanguage: English\nVersion: 0.9952b\n\n\nNEO Scavenger is a turn-based, rogue-like RPG where you must\nsurvive in the wasteland long enough to figure out who you are\nEach turn you must decide where to go, how to scavenge for\nsupplies, and how to deal with anything and anyone you encounter\nAnd with each passing minute, the pit in your stomach grows, your\ndehydration worsens, your muscles tire, and your body temperature\ndrops in the cold autumn air. Choose your starting abilities\ncarefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in\nthe apocalypse!\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bluebottlegames.com/main/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bluebottlegames.com/main/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstructions:\n1) Unzip (with executable)\n2) Enjoy!\n\nIt's DRM-Free as far as I know, however I would block it on your firewall anyway.\n\nHope you all enjoy this game! Buy it and support the developer! He really deserves it!\n\n-AppRipper &quot;Happy Hacking!&quot;\n\n*** CHANGELOG ****\n\nNone this time guys, Sorry!
