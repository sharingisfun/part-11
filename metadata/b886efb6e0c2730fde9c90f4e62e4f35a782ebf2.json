He worked for over a decade as a modestly successful songwriter and fledgling solo artist prior to breaking through -- assisted by the Neptunes -- with 2006's The Evolution of Robin Thicke. On that album, his inspirations, ranging from '70s Marvin Gaye to Philly soul to classic Brazilian music, vividly coalesced with his somewhat brash personality and remarkable vocal skill. It was the first of several Top Ten R&amp;B albums in a career that involved symbiotic collaborations with long-term associate Pro-Jay, Pharrell and Chad Hugo, Mark Ronson, and Polow da Don, as well as credibility-enhancing appearances from (or with) Lil Wayne, Faith Evans, Jay-Z, Rick Ross, and T.I.\n\n\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.You're My Fantasy\n02.Get Her Back\n03.Still Madly Crazy\n04.Lock The Door\n05.Whatever I Want\n06.Living In New York City\n07.Love Can Grow Back\n08.Black Tar Cloud\n09.Too Little Too Late\n10.Tippy Toes\n11.Something Bad\n12.The Opposite Of Me\n13.Time Of Your Life\n14.Forever Love\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b886efb6e0c2730fde9c90f4e62e4f35a782ebf2","amp;dn":"Robin+Thicke+-+Paula+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b886efb6e0c2730fde9c90f4e62e4f35a782ebf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,134,239,182,224,194,115,15,222,156,144,244,230,46,79,53,167,130,235,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
