Written by an expert in alcohol and drug addiction and recovery, this no-nonsense guide will help you understand the causes of addiction, end enabling behaviors, support your loved oneâ€™s recovery, and learn how to cope with relapses.\r\nIf youâ€™re the family member of an addict, you may feel confused, guilty, and scared of doing the wrong thing. And when you donâ€™t know how to help, you may find yourself in a codependent role, trying so hard to keep your addicted loved one alive, out of jail, or emotionally appeased that you may actually prevent them from realizing they need help.\r\nDrawing on her own personal experience with her brotherâ€™s addiction, Addict in the House offers a pragmatic, step-by-step guide to dealing with a loved oneâ€™s addiction, from accepting the reality of the disease to surviving what may be repeated cycles of recovery and relapse. Youâ€™ll learn how to encourage your addicted loved one to get help without forcing it, and finally find the strength to let go of codependence.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89dcae29da8edbc206ea2204e509f19d76a9cbb","amp;dn":"Addict+in+the+House+-+Robin+Barnett+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89dcae29da8edbc206ea2204e509f19d76a9cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,157,202,226,157,168,237,188,32,110,162,32,78,80,159,25,215,106,156,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
