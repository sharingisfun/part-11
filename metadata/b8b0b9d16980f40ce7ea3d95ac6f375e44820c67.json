Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.\n\nBad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, Bad Company (1974), Straight Shooter (1975) and Run With the Pack (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and US. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, remain staples of classic rock radio.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBad Company is the debut studio album by British hard rock supergroup Bad Company. The album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973, and the first release of Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records.\n\nThe album reached the top of the US Billboard 200. Since then, the album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and became the 46th best selling album of the 1970s. The album spent 25 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, entering at No. 10 and reaching its highest position of No. 3 in the second week. Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 40 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\nThe singles &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Movin' On&quot; peaked at No. 5 and No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; (the last originally recorded by guitarist Mick Ralphs during his tenure with Mott the Hoople on All the Young Dudes) are also &quot;classic rock&quot; radio staples. In 2006 a limited edition CD of 24K gold was released. A previous remaster was released in 1994.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nPaul Rodgers: vocals, rhythm guitar on &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, piano on &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, all instruments on &quot;Seagull&quot;\n\nMick Ralph: guitar, keyboards on &quot;Ready for Love&quot;\n\nSimon Kirke: drums\n\nBoz Burrell: bass\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\n\nSue Glover and Sunny Leslie: Backing vocals on &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;.\n\nMel Collins: saxophones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b0b9d16980f40ce7ea3d95ac6f375e44820c67","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+-+Bad+Company+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B1974%5D%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BDE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b0b9d16980f40ce7ea3d95ac6f375e44820c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,176,185,209,105,128,244,12,231,234,61,149,172,111,55,94,68,130,12,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
