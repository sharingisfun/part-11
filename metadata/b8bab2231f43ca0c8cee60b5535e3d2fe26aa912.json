Ted discovers what he believes could be a fortune in Spanish gold aboard a sunken ship and sets out to rescue it with the help of go-go dancing yoga expert Jo Symington (Dodie Marshall). However, Gil Carey (Skip Ward) is also after the treasure and uses his girlfriend Dina Bishop (Pat Priest) to foil Ted's plans. Elvis sings six tunes in this picture, including the deathless &quot;Yoga Is as Yoga Does&quot; and &quot;The Love Machine.&quot;\n\nPAL,region 2.\n\nMore Elvis here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/burning.love/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso Arabic,Bulgarian,Croatic,Cech,Greek,Hebrew,Hongarian,Iceland,Romanian,Serv,\nSlovanian and Turkish subtitles.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8bab2231f43ca0c8cee60b5535e3d2fe26aa912","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Easy+come%2C+easy+go+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8bab2231f43ca0c8cee60b5535e3d2fe26aa912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,186,178,35,31,67,202,12,140,238,96,181,83,94,61,47,226,106,169,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
