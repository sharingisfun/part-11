Officer Mike Biggs (Billy Gardell) is a good-hearted cop who sincerely wants to lose weight. Mike's partner, Officer Carl McMillan (Reno Wilson), is a thin, fast-talking wise-guy, who despite his teasing encourages Mike on his road to slimness and romance. While speaking at an O.A. meeting, Mike meets Molly Flynn (Melissa McCarthy), an instantly likeable fourth-grade teacher with a healthy sense of humor about her curves. For Molly, focusing on smart choices isn't easy because she lives with her sexy older sister, Victoria (Katy Mixon), and their mother, Joyce (Swoosie Kurtz), both of whom flaunt their healthy appetites and slender figures. Mike also faces temptation at the diner he and Carl frequent, where they've become friends with the Senegalese waiter, Samuel (Nyambi Nyambi), who finds trying to eat less a foreign concept. For &quot;Mike and Molly&quot;, thanks to their mutual love of pie and the desire to resist it, finding each other may have been worth the &quot;weight.&quot;[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9032c9c1ecafc9b1ea80bfc25966a207ad5ec1d","amp;dn":"Mike.and.Molly.S05E01.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9032c9c1ecafc9b1ea80bfc25966a207ad5ec1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,3,44,156,30,202,252,155,30,168,11,252,37,150,106,32,122,213,236,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
