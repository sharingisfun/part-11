Based on true events and written by acclaimed director Abbas Kiarostami (A Taste of Cherry), CRIMSON GOLD is the story of Hussein, a humble pizza deliveryman who feels continually humiliated by the injustices he sees all around him. When his friend Ali finds a receipt for a stranger&amp;#039;s necklace purchase, Hussein is stunned by its exceptionally high cost. He knows that his pitiful salary will never be enough to afford such a luxury. Soon after, he and Ali are refused entry to an uptown jewelry store because of their scruffy appearances; his rage over this slight sets off a series of events. But Hussein will taste the luxurious life for one night before his deep feelings of humiliation push him over the edge.\n\n~~~~~~ Crimson Gold.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,192,648,704                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:32:21                \nFrame Count:....................................132840             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................400                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.680                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1582                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.245&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................127                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\nMy rip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9169fd5c261d1815df2a0670c495637f758ad17","amp;dn":"Jafar+Panahi+-+Talaye+sorkh+aka+Crimson+Gold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9169fd5c261d1815df2a0670c495637f758ad17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,22,159,213,194,97,209,129,93,242,160,103,12,73,86,55,247,88,173,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
