Linking the structural characteristics with the broader sociological context, the book emphasizes the strong influence of sociological issues on politics, such as social milieu shaping and the articulation of the political in day-to-day events. Political events are connected with the ever-changing social, economic and political processes in order to provide an analytical framework to explain Ã¢â‚¬ËœpeculiaritiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of Indian politics. Bidyut Chakrabarty argues that three major ideological influences of colonialism, nationalism and democracy have provided the foundational values of Indian politics.\n\nStructured thematically and chronologically, this work is a useful resource for students of political science, sociology and South Asian studies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9252aea6839015b161ef02f698862fed0a015ff","amp;dn":"Indian+Politics+and+Society+Since+Independence+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9252aea6839015b161ef02f698862fed0a015ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,37,42,234,104,57,1,91,22,30,240,47,105,136,98,254,208,160,21,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
