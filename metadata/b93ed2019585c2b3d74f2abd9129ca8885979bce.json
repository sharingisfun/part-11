The title is rendered in English as Flower Garland Sutra, Flower Adornment Sutra, or Flowers Ornament Scripture.  This is the translation into English by Thomas Cleary. \n\nThis text describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing each other. The vision expressed in this work was the foundation for the creation of the Huayan school of Chinese Buddhism, which was characterized by a philosophy of interpenetration. Hua-yen is known as Kegon in Japan.\n\nThe sutra is also well known for its detailed description of the course of the bodhisattva's practice through ten stages.\n\nHistory\nThe sutra was written in stages, beginning from at least 500 years after the death of the Buddha. Two full Chinese translations of the Avatamsaka Sutra were made. Fragmentary translation probably began in the second century CE, and the famous Ten Stages Sutra, often treated as an individual scripture, was first translated in the third century. The first complete Chinese version was completed by Buddhabhadra around 420, and the second by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ikÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nanda around 699. There is also a translation of the Gandavyuha by PrajÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ around 798. The second translation includes more sutras than the first, and the Tibetan translation, which is still later, includes even more. Scholars conclude that sutras were being added to the collection.\n\n\nFormat\nThe sutra, among the largest in the Buddhist canon, contains 40 chapters of somewhat disparate topics, though with some overarching themes:\n\nThe interdepency of all phenomena (dharmas). \nThe progression of the Buddhist path to full Enlightenment, or Buddhahood. \nTwo of the chapters serve as sutras in their own right, and have been cited in the writings of many Buddhists in East Asia.\n\nThe Twenty-Sixth Chapter: Ten Stages Sutra\nChapter 26, the Dasabhumika Sutra or Sutra of the Ten Stages details the ten stages, or bhÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«mi, of development a bodhisattva must undergo to attain supreme enlightenment. The ten stages are also depicted in the Lankavatara Sutra. The sutra also touches on the subject of the development of the aspiration for Enlightenment.\n\n\n[edit] The Final Chapter: The Gandavyuha Sutra\nThe last chapter of the Avatamsaka also circulates as a separate text known as the Gandavyuha Sutra. The Gandavyuha Sutra details the journey of the youth Sudhana, who undertakes a pilgrimage at the behest of the bodhisattva Manjushri. Sudhana will converse with 52 masters in his quest for enlightenment. The ante-penultimate master of Sudhana's pilgrimage is Maitreya. It is here that Sudhana encounters &quot;The Tower of Maitreya,&quot; which along with &quot;Indra's net&quot; is one of the most startling metaphors of the infinite to emerge in the history of literature across cultures.\n\n&quot;In the middle of the great tower... he saw the billion-world universe... and everywhere there was Sudhana at his feet... Thus Sudhana saw Maitreya's practices of... transcendence over countless eons, from each of the squares of the check board wall... In the same way Sudhana... saw the whole supernal manifestation, was perfectly aware it, understood it, contemplated it, used it as a means, beheld it, and saw himself there.&quot;\n\nThe penultimate master that Sudhana visits is the bodhisattva Manjushri. Thus, one of the grandest, and most fully loaded with perennial symbolism, of pilgrimages comes to its conclusion by first revisiting where it began. The Gandavyhua suggests that with a subtle shift of perspective we may come to see that the enlightenment that the pilgrim so fervently sought was not only with him at every stage of his journey, but as well before it kick off; that enlightenment is not 'something to be gained' since, to begin with, the pilgrim (aka all of us) never departed from 'it'.\n\nThe final master that Sudhana visits is the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, who teaches him that wisdom is only for the sake of putting it into practice, that is, in benefiting all living beings all over the universe according to conditions.\n\n&quot;When this done, the world of the Gandavyuha (ceases) to be a mystery, a realm devoid of form and corporeality, for now it overlaps this earthly world; no, it becomes that 'Thou art it' and there is a perfect fusion of the two... Samantabhadra's arms raised to save sentient beings become our own, which are now engaged in passing salt to a friend at the table and Maitreya's opening the Vairocana Tower for Sudhana is our ushering a caller into the parlor for a friendly chat.&quot;\n\nThe Avatamsaka Sutra (The Sutra of the Garland of Flowers) is among the largest and greatest of the scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism. It is 12 volumes in Chinese, and 1600 pages in this English edition published by Shambhala. As with most Mahayana scriptures, it treats Buddha not as merely a man of ancient India, but as a cosmic principle. Differing from the austere and non-theist Theravada scriptures, it is full of gods and goddesses, heavens, jewelled trees and imaginary beings. The Avatamsaka Sutra became very influential in Chinese Buddhism, and was responsible for the creation of the Hua-Yen school.\nThis edition by Thomas Cleary, THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, is excellent. It includes not only his translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, but also a book subsequently pinned onto it (the 400-page Gandhavyuha, or &quot;Entry into the Realm of Reality&quot;), the Chinese mystic Li Tongxuan's seventh-century commentary on the Gandhavyuha, a glossary of difficult Mahayana concepts, and an incredibly helpful translator's introduction.\n\nDr. Cleary ranks among the foremost translators of Asian religious literature and always succeeds in translating works clearly and precisely. In THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, his years of experience have enabled him to produce a stunning translation, and I can only admire his persistence in translating such a massive work. \n\nThis edition is really a treasure for Buddhist students. Or, should I say, serious students and scholars. At 1600 pages and a high cost (though much more inexpensive than several years ago), this tome is for the dedicated. THE FLOWER ORNAMENT SCRIPTURE, however, is an excellent translation. Dr. Cleary has benefitted Westerners greatly through his singular translation. \n\nYou can find Thich Nhat Hanh's retreat on the Avatamsaka Sutra in audio book format here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4124465/thich_nhat_hanh_-_the_ultimate_dimension_buddhism_retreat_zen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4124465/thich_nhat_hanh_-_the_ultimate_dimension_buddhism_retreat_zen&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b93ed2019585c2b3d74f2abd9129ca8885979bce","amp;dn":"Avatamsaka+sutra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b93ed2019585c2b3d74f2abd9129ca8885979bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,62,210,1,149,133,194,179,215,79,42,189,145,41,202,136,133,151,155,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
