This volume examines the cultural implications of feline companions while also celebrating the intimacy and joys of pets and family photographs. In seven thematic sections, Arluke and Rolfe engage with the collection of antique images as representations of real relationships and of ideal relationships, noting the cultural trends and tropes that occur throughout this increasingly popular practice. Whether as surrogate children, mascots, or companions to women, cats are part of modern American life and visual culture.\n\nEntertaining, smart, and filled with a collector s trove of wonderful images, The Photographed Cat pays homage to the surprising range of relationships we have with cats and offers thoughtful consideration of the ways in which we represent them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95ed008182d55c2f81415586045bbe688b59683","amp;dn":"The+Photographed+Cat+-+Picturing+Human-Feline+Ties%2C+1890-1940+%28A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95ed008182d55c2f81415586045bbe688b59683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,94,208,8,24,45,85,194,248,20,21,88,96,69,187,230,136,181,150,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
