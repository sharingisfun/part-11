Terence Wise's fascinating text lays bare the real story, and examines the armies, liveries and badges of the conflict. The author's readable account provides a comprehensive guide as to who fought whom, where, when, why and for what, from the origins of the Wars to such famous battles as Tewkesbury and Bosworth. The accompanying photographs, illustrations and colour plates by Gerry Embleton clearly detail the arms, armour and standards of the time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9aa59a25ff18f6f34ebe12bc7593a68d46e3b67","amp;dn":"The+Wars+of+the+Roses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9aa59a25ff18f6f34ebe12bc7593a68d46e3b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,170,89,162,95,241,143,111,52,235,225,43,199,89,58,104,212,110,59,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
