Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) may lack in the skills that their chieftain is looking for, but they have plans to make it big. Zed has a gut feeling that God has &quot;chosen&quot; him, and so he leads his buddy on a trip through the unknown countryside in search of bigger and better things, bumping into several weird characters along the way -- like a feuding pair of brothers named Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd). Unfortunately, their quest for greatness hits a few snags, like being sold into slavery, and later becoming the object of interest to a very amorous, very hairy high priest (Oliver Platt) in the opulent city of Sodom. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 3 Hours 17 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ad963454bd2fa7202295be18c8c9f6be178b7f","amp;dn":"Year%2C+One%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ad963454bd2fa7202295be18c8c9f6be178b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,173,150,52,84,189,47,167,32,34,149,190,24,200,201,246,190,23,139,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
