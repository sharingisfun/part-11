Formed in Ohio back in 2005 under the name Absentee. They released their debut record Absentee in 2008 featuring guest contributions from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe and The Human Furnace from Ringworm.\n\n&quot;As The World Burns&quot; is an all-star release that features J-Mann of Mushroomhead, M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Randy Blythe of Lamb Of God, Devin Townsend, Gene Hoglan, and The Human Furnace of Ringworm.\n\n&quot;This record is a compilation of my favorite PITCH BLACK FORECAST songs, which are remixed with additional tracking and far closer to my initial vision,&quot; said Popson, who recently rejoined MUSHROOMHEAD for the band's Top 20 Billboard-charting new record, &quot;The Righteous &amp; The Butterfly&quot;.\n\n&quot;The funny thing about side projects is the time frame in which you must deliver, sometimes things are rushed and unfocused. With this release, we've trimmed the fat and took our time compiling what I consider the definitive PITCH BLACK FORECAST release.&quot;\n\nAsked what genre PITCH BLACK FORECAST falls under, Popson simply said &quot;pissed&quot; to describe the aggressive wallop of the material.\n\n&quot;As The World Burns&quot; also features the debut of another J Mann side project called BITCH WRANGLER. A four-song EP entitled &quot;Spitef*ck&quot; will serve as bonus tracks on the CD.\n\nsafe_image_zps9477db4e.jpg\n\n\nQuote:\nSupergroups comprised of metal legends are becoming as popular as the resurgence of old-school death metal. Pitch Black Forecast, the creation of J. Mann of Mushroomhead and Gene Hoglan of Testament and Dark Angel, have spawned some extremely thrashy metal, similar to Revocation and Havok. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not throwback thrash, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing stretching the extremes of metal here, but their debut, As the World Burns, is an enjoyable listen. If it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get your head banging, nothing will!\n\nThe album opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open Letter To God,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ features none other than guitar legend Devin Townsend. The song is blistering, and Hoglan showcases why he truly is a legend. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Landmine,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Avenged Sevenfold vocalist M. Shadows, is another chugging, riff-filled monster of a song. ShadowsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ vocals hearken back to the early years o his band, and Mann sounds incredible here. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Season In HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pure thrash. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s catchy, yet brutal as hell! The title track follows the same basic formula as the previous songs, but it is my favorite here. The gang vocals in the chorus sound phenomenal. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So Low,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring vocals from Lamb of GodÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Randy Blythe, is slower, but his vocals are fucking crazy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“AtonementÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is razor-sharp, and it goes from breakneck speed to roaring, chugging breaks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wrapped in Plastic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Human Furnace from Ringworm on guest vocals, is a burning lesson in violence. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just insane!\n\nPitch Black Forecast arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t breaking any metal molds, but they are putting together some incredible thrash. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell you how many times I have listened to this album, and I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t grown tired of it. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fun listen, and we can use that in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world of 10,000 sub-genres of metal.\n\nRating: 4/5 Stars\n\n\n\n\n&quot;As The World Burns&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
