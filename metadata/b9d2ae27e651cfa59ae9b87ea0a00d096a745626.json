Scheduled passenger services were introduced in 1912 when more people moved into the area following development of the forestry industry. \n\nAfter World War II, logging camps began to close and traffic ceased in the 1960s with some parts of the line also being closed. However, in the late 1990s as tourism began to rise, passenger services re-started when the line was bought by a local businessman. \n\nThe real-life Furusato Ginga Line was most recently operated by the Hokkaido Chihoku KÃ…ï¿½gen Railway Company until its closure in 2006. The first section of the line connected Ikeda and Rikunbetsu and was opened in September 1910. In 1987, with the line extended north to Abashiri, Japanese National Railways was privatised and JR Hokkaido took over management of the line. However, as traffic dwindled, the last owners of the line - HokkaidÃ…ï¿½ Chihoku KÃ…ï¿½gen Railway Company Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ceased operations on 21 April 2006. \n\nFeaturing custom-built Japanese buildings and trackside detailing, prototypical signalling and 15 stations along its main line and branch line, The Story of Forest Rail brings a unique feel to Train Simulator with its story based scenarios and two distinctive railbuses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Kiha 750 and Kiha 720.\n\nNOTE: This version its the one sold on steam shop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d2ae27e651cfa59ae9b87ea0a00d096a745626","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+The+Story+of+Forest+Rail+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d2ae27e651cfa59ae9b87ea0a00d096a745626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,210,174,39,230,81,207,165,154,233,184,126,160,160,13,9,106,116,86,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
