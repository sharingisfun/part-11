Taking a T. Rex-styled glam strut and running it through their trademark clang'n'scrape feedback wringer, it's a monstrous track, the best song from the group since their Psychocandy days. \nA large number of tracks essentially continue the Psychocandy aesthetic without adding much to it, though those not entirely taken with Darklands will find much to love with the likes of &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;Cracked.&quot; \nMeanwhile, two alternate versions of album cuts -- an acoustic take on &quot;Taste of Cindy&quot; and a neat demo take of &quot;On the Wall&quot; -- add to the fun.
