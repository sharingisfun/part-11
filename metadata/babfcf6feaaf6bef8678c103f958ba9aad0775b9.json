She presents and analyzes the available historical data in order to outline what these empresses did, what the sources thought they did, and what they wanted to do. Revealed are stories of imperial women who had considerable resources, such as powerful patronage, their own courts of women, eunuchs and ministers and who wielded an enormous amount of influence, such as total government control and the power to issue coinage and decrees.\nLavishly illustrated, Byzantine Empresses provides an immense contribution to the study of women in Byzantine civilization.\n\nTitle: Byzantine Empresses: Women and Power in Byzantium AD 527-1204\nAuthor: Lynda Garland\nPublisher: Routledge\nYear: 1999\nFormat: PDF -EPUB - MOBI (Conversions from PDF).\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
