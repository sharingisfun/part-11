It explains the biochemical functions of the essential nutrients and the physiological consequences of deficient and excessive intakes. These are described within the context of normal human diets and requirements for health. Although this book is about human nutrition, in some instances there are comparisons with and examples of other mammalian species to facilitate understanding of the principles. Molecular Basis of Human Nutrition is the only book to cover this particular subject and will prove very popular with both students and lecturers alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae7d5f586ed4ee31ce6a40273b0de4e73e6f8a2","amp;dn":"Molecular+Basis+of+Human+Nutrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae7d5f586ed4ee31ce6a40273b0de4e73e6f8a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,231,213,245,134,237,78,227,28,230,164,2,115,176,222,78,115,230,248,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
