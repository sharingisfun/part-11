Firstly there were watermarks, starting with small\nnumbers counting from 0 to 9 randomly hardcoded in the video, and that during the\nwhole movie, popping up mainly in the centre eye of the video half lucent. some kind\nof weird code for identifying dont know, cant blur them only when they appear, would\nbe around 300.000 of them, so made small constant blur spots over the 20 spots where\nthey randomly appear, now they are gone, wont effect the viewing, hardly seeable\nunless you are searching for it on purpose. second watermark is a long line also\nhardcoded in the video with exact details of owner, had to blur those parts only\nwhen they appear, none of this line watermark appears twice on the same spot, so had\nto blur each one manually and adjust them. that was a pita, 720 cuts were necessary\nto remove them, some are above, below left or right, not that much are in the center\nof viewing, but some are, and if its daylight you will see them slightly, only appear\n10sec each time there is no other way to get it any more secure.\n\nsample is a bit longer, i chose a spot where you can see the blurs\nthe quality was already amazing, only added sharpness, well and the blurs\nthe video is complete nothing is cut out.\n\ndecided to make 2 versions...\none as usual for high quality, size 2.4gb 720x304 @1700\nand another for guys with lower bandwith, size 1.4gb 640x272 @1000\n\nits a big risk going out with this movie, hope you appreciate my work\n\nI am a big fan of Lord of the Rings, watched each in cinema, and if you are too,\nyou should also go to the cinema and support the producer and watch the movie on\na big screen, in 3d perhaps with the higher framerate.\n\nenjoy\n\nIMDB Info:\n\nName: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\nGenre: Fantasy\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/&lt;/a&gt;  \nIMDB Rating: 8.4/10 from 145,894 users\nDirector: Peter Jackson\nWriters: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens\nCast: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage\nPlot: A younger and more reluctant Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, sets out on a\n&quot;unexpected journey&quot; to the Lonely Mountain with a spirited group of Dwarves to\nreclaim a their stolen mountain home from a dragon named Smaug. \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97014098743056209070.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97014098743056209070.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30426575680888644377.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30426575680888644377.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72216497780412253216.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72216497780412253216.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae8b0e44f38577467ff2557c845e62d253d4105","amp;dn":"The.Hobbit.2012.DVDSCR.XVID.AC3.Hive-CM8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae8b0e44f38577467ff2557c845e62d253d4105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,232,176,228,79,56,87,116,103,255,37,87,200,69,230,45,37,61,65,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
