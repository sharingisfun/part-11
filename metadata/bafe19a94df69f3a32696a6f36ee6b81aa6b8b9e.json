While i think i can cut it off if necessary, i see no reason to do that. This isn't the first case when soundtrack music contains movie sounds.\n\nNote2: &quot;You know my name&quot; song is NOT included in official Casino Royale movie soundtrack and is distributed separately. Also, this version of &quot;You know my name&quot; (from the movie) is different from the MP3 version ( http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3566747/Chris_Cornell_-_You_Know_My_Name.mp3 ), for more details read Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Know_My_Name .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bafe19a94df69f3a32696a6f36ee6b81aa6b8b9e","amp;dn":"Chris+Cornell+and+David+Arnold+-+Casino+Royale+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bafe19a94df69f3a32696a6f36ee6b81aa6b8b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,254,25,169,77,246,159,58,50,105,106,111,54,238,107,129,170,107,139,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
