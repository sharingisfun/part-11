Our coverage is selectiveâ€”we wonâ€™t\r\ncover every single flag or exploitâ€”but we give you the foundation youâ€™ll need\r\nto understand and use Metasploit now and in future versions.\r\nWhen we began writing this book, we had in mind a comment by HD\r\nMoore, developer of the Metasploit Framework. In a conversation with HD\r\nabout the development of our Metasploit Unleashed course, one of us said\r\nto him, â€œI hope the course comes out good.â€ To this offhand comment, HD\r\nmerely replied, â€œThen make sure it is good.â€ And thatâ€™s just what weâ€™ve\r\nattempted to do with this book.\r\nAs a group, we are experienced penetration testers who use Metasploit\r\ndaily to circumvent security controls, bypass protections, and attack systems\r\nmethodically. We wrote this book with the intention of helping our readers\r\nbecome competent penetration testers. HDâ€™s drive and focus on quality is\r\napparent within the Metasploit Framework, and we have tried to match those\r\ncharacteristics in this book. We leave it up to you to judge how well we have\r\nlived up to that standard.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to seed.\r\n\r\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;SEED UNTIL YOU BLEED&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baff11325d0c9f9b2eb5b69de01a680d450d28e3","amp;dn":"Metasploit+The+Penetration+Tester%27s+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baff11325d0c9f9b2eb5b69de01a680d450d28e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,255,17,50,93,12,159,155,46,181,182,157,224,26,104,13,69,13,40,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
