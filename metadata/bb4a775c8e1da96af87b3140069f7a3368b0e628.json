The main part of the book provides full details of more than 45 species, with advice on how to identify them and use them in the kitchen; it includes recipe suggestions as well as tips for nonculinary uses. It details both the more common weeds, such as nettles, dandelions, chickweed, and ground elder, and the less common, such as brook-lime and pineappleweed. The directory covers both native and nonnative species, including some troublesome invasives. Advice is also given on avoiding plants that are harmful if eaten.
