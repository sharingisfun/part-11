A routine missing-persons case soon turns into a nightmare of voodoo and black magic.\n\nFrom an Amazon customer review:\nFalling Angel is one of the best horror novels I have ever read, so fast paced I'm amazed there aren't scorch marks on the pages of my copy. At first you think you are reading a detective novel, and then a Horror novel, and then decidedly, the demented offspring of both genres.\n\nLow rent private eye, Harry Angel is recruited to find a pre-war crooner by the name of Johnny Favorite, a singer indebted to Angel's client. A client by the name of Louis Cyphre. Angel's pursuit of Johnny Favorite takes him to the seediest of locales in mid 1950's New York and enlightens him on the city's darker side. A world of witchcraft and voodoo and unspeakable rituals. All the while Harry Angel is trying to deal with his own amnesia. As the mystery unfolds so does the terror and slowly as each piece is revealed Harry Angel walks the tightrope of madness. Not only is Falling Angel an intelligently crafted Horror novel it is incredibly vicious as well. Yet strangely it seems to be more of a cult favorite than a Horror novel that everybody knows. All I can say is that it is one of the most original Horror tales I have ever read, impossible not to read in one sitting. It was made into a movie called Angel Heart that follows the basic outline of the story and the plot but does some shifting of locales not seen in the book. The movie was good, the book a thousand times better. A must read for horror fans. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8f7ab8ae1547a1a61b4e95669c97e2e59c5db7","amp;dn":"William+Hjortsberg+-+Falling+Angel%2CEpub%2CLit%2CPdf%2CMobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8f7ab8ae1547a1a61b4e95669c97e2e59c5db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,143,122,184,174,21,71,161,166,27,78,149,102,156,151,226,229,156,93,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
