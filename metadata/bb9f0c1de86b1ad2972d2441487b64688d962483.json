Her unadorned voice takes center stage to sparse acoustic instrumental arrangements. Is this country folk or torch song jazz, adult contemporary or art song? The answer doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really matter as much as the fact that this is truly a marvelous creation. The recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only failing is that it clocks in at a mere 33 minutes in length. It leaves one gasping for more.\n\nDiane works with a palette of primary colors; musically with simple melodies and unaffected vocals, as well as lyrically. Not only does she sing of Ã¢â‚¬Å“yellow curtainsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“red velvet seatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Colorado blueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and such, she makes straightforward statements like Ã¢â‚¬Å“being one foot out the doorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I woke up drunk on that basement floorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that say exactly what she means and implies so much more. Of course, this is what one would expect from an album that presciently begins, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I said what I needed to say, I guess.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even before she gets to the second line, Diane tells us sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s said it all already. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laconic as well as suggestively literate.\n\nDianeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hemingwayesque vocabulary lets you know the vulnerability of her narrators without having to spell out the emotions. And like Hemingway, Diane also sings about whiskey and having too much to drink. Alcohol frees her characters to feelÃ¢â‚¬â€good and badÃ¢â‚¬â€about their relationships. Mostly, they feel lost and overwhelmed. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some things are best if kept in darkness,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings, and notes that one only tells fibs when awake. Sleep and alcohol keep one honest, and honesty is a virtue. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our conscious behaviors and motivations that are not to be trusted.\n\nThe overall effect of plain language and unembellished vocals reifies DianeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sincerity. Diane went through a recent divorce and it is easy to see these songs as self-reflective, but who knows or cares if this is true. The music here stands apart from her biography. One does not need to confirm the veracity of her feelings or language as much as believe in DianeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance. She makes the narrative heartfelt through her presentation. The stories she delivers, the details she provides, and the manner in which Diane carries it off seduces the listener into empathy. The pain itself comes off as convincingly real, and more importantly, so does her resolution to move forward.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9f0c1de86b1ad2972d2441487b64688d962483","amp;dn":"Alela+Diane+-+About+Farewell+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9f0c1de86b1ad2972d2441487b64688d962483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,159,12,29,232,107,26,210,151,45,36,65,72,123,100,104,141,150,36,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
