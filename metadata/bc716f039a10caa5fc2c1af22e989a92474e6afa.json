Different lineup and the festival stage layout is totally different than the fall Tension 2013 layout. Broadcasted from Fuji Rocks Festival and have to give a big BIG thanks to C. Morris for capturing the video in it's full 720HD with no glitches or hiccups. As this was blacked out in the United States, many of the fans in the US used proxy servers but had a lot of lag. We were putting incomplete pieces together, I thank everyone who got involved to help out. But with this, we don't need to merge anything!\n\nGreat performance and the new songs sound amazing! A few reworks of some of the older songs as well! This is the first time Sanctified has been played since 1996. This is the debut of 3 new tracks that will be on the upcoming album &quot;Hesitation Marks,&quot; the tracks are &quot;Copy of A&quot; &quot;Came Back Haunted&quot; and &quot;Find My Way.&quot;\n\nIf you have any past recordings of Nine Inch Nails you would like to add to the live archive at http://www.reflectinginthechrome.com, or are taping any concerts in the future please get in contact with me at ryanj at reflectinginthechrome dot com! Enjoy!
