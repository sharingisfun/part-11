With Boost 11's simple interface, you'll have your songs radio- and duplication-ready in no time at all.\n\nThe Boost 11 Peak Limiter provides transparent peak limiting and volume maximization without coloring the sound of the source material. Boost 11 employs a &quot;look-ahead&quot; limiter algorithm to prevent output clipping and PDR (Program Dependent Release) to minimize pumping (fluctuations of the volume) and maximize the loudness.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc931cfb80899647728792c3937e497955789019","amp;dn":"Cakewalk+Boost+11+Vst+plug+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc931cfb80899647728792c3937e497955789019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,147,28,251,128,137,150,71,114,135,146,195,147,126,73,121,85,120,144,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
