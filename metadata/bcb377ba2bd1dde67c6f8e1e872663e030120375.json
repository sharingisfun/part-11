There was a closeness to the sound as his voice swam alongside his two-string slide bass, Dana ColleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saxophone, and Billy ConwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums in MorphineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seductive Ã¢â‚¬Å“low-rock.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn the documentary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cure for Pain: The Mark Sandman Story,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ playing the Brattle Theatre Friday through July 1, it is observed that there was a true disparity between how enigmatic the Massachusetts native was and how intimately listeners felt connected to him. It was a real gift and one of the many reasons it was so wrenching when Sandman passed away on July 3, 1999, while playing a gig with Morphine in Italy. He was 46.\n\nThe 84-minute Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cure for PainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aims to illuminate the man behind the sound.\n\nBecause, as the film tells us repeatedly, Sandman was a deeply private person, the portrait is hardly complete. But filmmakers Robert G. Bralver and David Ferino shrewdly work within their limitations. (For instance, a long interlude of Sandman traveling as a young man is illustrated with postcards from Alaska, Peru, and other places.) And with SandmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends, band mates, family members, and girlfriend Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as some terrific archival interviews Ã¢â‚¬â€ filling in the gaps, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cure for PainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a loving and candid look at SandmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and artistry.\n\nFollowing a typical rock doc chronology, we watch Sandman evolve from artistic child to world traveler to innovative rocker through photos, home video, newspaper clippings, and best of all, live performances.\n\nFellow musicians such as Mike Watt, Ben Harper, and Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones opine on the Newton-bred singer-songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical contributions. Band mates Colley and Conway reminisce about their brother. In the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most poignant passages, SandmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents discuss their reaction to his unconventional life and the effects of the deaths of SandmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger brothers Jon and Roger, who were also buried far too young.\n\nSandman himself beams out from TV interviews in all his slyly comic and laconic glory.\n\nAs Watt says succinctly in the film, Sandman was Ã¢â‚¬Å“a very happening cat.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The best thing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cure for PainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ accomplishes is helping remind people of just how happening, and of SandmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inimitable voice.\n\nWritten by Sarah Rodman\n\nFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFile size : 1.45 GiB \nDuration : 1h 25mn \nOverall bit rate : 2 426 Kbps \nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release) \nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release \n\nVideo \nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : No \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 1h 25mn \nBit rate : 2 191 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 392 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.85:1 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.259 \nStream size : 1.31 GiB (90%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01) \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nMode extension : CM (complete main) \nFormat settings, Endianness : Big \nCodec ID : 2000 \nDuration : 1h 25mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 224 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nBit depth : 16 bits \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 137 MiB (9%) \nAlignment : Split accross interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb377ba2bd1dde67c6f8e1e872663e030120375","amp;dn":"Cure+for+Pain+-+The+Mark+Sandman+Story+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb377ba2bd1dde67c6f8e1e872663e030120375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,179,119,186,43,209,221,230,124,111,142,30,135,38,99,224,48,18,3,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
