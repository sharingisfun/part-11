The title is published in 14&quot; x 20&quot; broadsheet format, deliberately similar to Sunday newspaper comics sections.  Each edition features 15 pages, each from a different story by a different creative team.   Spearheaded by DCU Editorial Art Director, Mark Chiarello, creators were approached and asked to develop stories for the characters they would most like to write. Each issue is 16 pages and each story takes up one full page when folded out.\n\nEvery issue prints the strips in the following sequence:\n\n* Batman - story by Brian Azzarello with art by Eduardo Risso.
