The England-born Adamson formed Big Country in mid-1981 following his exit from the Scottish punk quartet the Skids, enlisting childhood friend Bruce Watson on second guitar; Clive Parker and brothers Pete and Alan Wishart completed the original lineup, but were soon replaced by bassist Tony Butler and drummer Mark Brzezicki. Signing to Polygram's Mercury imprint, the band issued its debut single, 'Harvest Home,' in the fall of 1982; a series of opening dates on the Jam's farewell tour increased Big Country's visibility exponentially, and the follow-up, 'Fields of Fire,' cracked the U.K. Top Ten. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tMercury\nCatalog:\t\t548117\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.93% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.In A Big Country\n02.Inwards\n03.Chance\n04.1,000 Stars\n05.The Storm\n06.Harvest Home\n07.Lost Patrol\n08.Close Action\n09.Fields Of Fire\n10.Porrohman\n11.Wonderland\n12.All Fall Together\n13.Angle Park\n14.The Crossing\n15.Chance (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6d00108bc6fd7d3474557d40192fa2c0d46442","amp;dn":"Big+Country+-+The+Crossing+%5BRemaster%5D+2002+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6d00108bc6fd7d3474557d40192fa2c0d46442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,109,0,16,139,198,253,125,52,116,85,125,64,25,47,162,192,212,100,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
