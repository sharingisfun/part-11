This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\n10CC has their first top 40 hit with &quot;I'm Not In Love&quot; (at number 38) and so does Tanya Tucker with &quot;Lizzie And The Rainman&quot; (at number 37) but the highest debut song is &quot;Swearin' To God&quot; by Frankie Valli (at number 34).\n\nElvis has his 139th hit record with &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; (at number 35). Casey says Elvis has also had 18 #1 hits and 38 top 10's.\n\nA listener wants to know if a comedy team has ever hit number one on the singles chart. Casey says no and the comedy team that got the biggest laugh made it to number 9 only a year earlier.\n\nVan McCoy &amp; The Soul Symphony Orchestra is at number 29 with &quot;The Hustle&quot; which Casey says Van McCoy wrote the song without ever having seen the dance and put it on his latest album at the last minute.\n\nCasey reports on whatever became of Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler. He was a Green Beret whose patriotic hit, &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; stayed in the number one spot for five weeks in 1966.\n\nThere is the &quot;current smash&quot; by the singer/songwriter whose image is so squeaky clean that Time Magazine called him the &quot;Tom Sawyer of Rock.&quot;\n\nThere is also the latest hit by the only recording act to make the top 10 during every calendar year of the 70's so far.\n\n40:    Midnight Blue - Melissa Manchester\n39:    One Of These Nights - The Eagles\n38:    I'm Not In Love - 10CC        \n37:    Lizzie And The Rainman - Tanya Tucker     \n36:    Why Can't We Be Friends - War     \n35:    T-R-O-U-B-L-E - Elvis Presley    \n34:    Swearin' To God - Frankie Valli\n33:    Judy Mae - Boomer Castleman\n32:    Dynomite - Bazuka\n31:    Hey You - Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n30:    Baby That's Backatcha - Smokey Robinson\n29:    The Hustle - Van McCoy &amp; The Soul Symphony Orchestra    \n28:    Misty - Ray Stevens\n27:    The Way We Were - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n26:    Shakey Ground - The Temptations\n25:    Remember What I Told You To Forget - Tavares\n24:    Attitude Dancing - Carly Simon\n23:    I Wanna Dance Wit' Choo (Do Dat Dance) - Disco Tex &amp; The Sex-O-Lettes\n22:    Listen To What The Man Said - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n21:    I'll Play For You (Hear The Band) - Seals &amp; Crofts\n20:    Last Farewell - Roger Whittaker\n19:    Before The Next Teardrop Falls - Freddy Fender\n18:    How Long - Ace\n17:    Magic - Pilot\n16:    Shining Star - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n15:    Bad Luck (Part 1) - Harold Melvin &amp; The Bluenotes\n14:    Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me) - The Doobie Brothers\n13:    Only Women - Alice Cooper\n12:    Wildfire - Michael Murphy\n11:    Cut The Cake - The Average White Band\n10:    Get Down, Get Down (Get On The Floor) - Joe Simon\n9:    Philadelphia Freedom - Elton John Band\n8:    Thank God I'm A Country Boy - John Denver\n7:    Love Won't Let Me Wait - Major Harris\n6:    I'm Not Lisa - Jessie Coulter\n5:    Old Days - Chicago\n4:    Bad Time - Grand Funk\n3:    When Will I Be Loved - Linda Ronstadt\n2:    Love Will Keep Us Together - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n1:    Sister Golden Hair - America","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd8cd0d09b72974db23945c12978dc915f9c178e","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1975_June_14th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd8cd0d09b72974db23945c12978dc915f9c178e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,140,208,208,155,114,151,77,178,57,69,193,41,120,220,145,95,156,23,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
