A mysterious gunfighter dressed in black accompanied by his young naked son cross the desert on a holy mission of vengence and redemption.\nIt's a pretty twisted film that's highly enjoyable.\nToo many crazy visuals for a sane person to handle. Many of the film's scenes will be burned into you brain long after you seen it. ItÃ‚Â´s like a bad LSD trip.\nI highly recommend this movie, It's one you'll never forgot. A true experince in film-making.\nA film Only for the opendmined, itÃ‚Â´s not for everyone!\n\n(spanish audio, english sub)\n\nI HAVE A LOT OF WIERD MOVIES BUT IÃ‚Â´M ONLY GOING TO UPPLOAD THEM IF YOU DOWNLOADERS SEEDING THEM! \n\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&quot;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE!&quot; \n[thanks to cor for that]\n\nMy movies so far: \nFando y Lis \nThe holy mountain \nEl topo \nSanta Sangre \nUzumaki \nThe happiness of the katakuris \nSession 9 \nThe great silence \nFAUST\nAn Andalusian Dog\nThe Rainbow thief\nGlen or Glenda\nALICE\nThe Exterminating Angel \nViva la muerte \nBride of the monster\nThe Nine Lives of Tomas Katz \nConspirators of Pleasure \nBEGOTTEN\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?
