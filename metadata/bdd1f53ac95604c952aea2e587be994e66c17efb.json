A silent battle is being waged on our nation everyday. Not with guns and bombs, but via covert sources: Islamic charities, the ACLU--even presidential candidates. They are all pawns in a stealth holy war. Unwittingly advancing the jihadist agenda not by violence, but through endeavors designed to acclimate and subject us to Islamic law--just the way Osama bin Laden wants it. In Stealth Jihad, bestselling author Robert Spencer exposes how a silent but lethal movement is advancing on the U.S. and calls upon Americans to resist it--before it's too late.\nFrom the Inside Flap\nDoes America face a jihadist threat that's even bigger than terrorism?\nWhile our homeland security efforts are focused on preventing terrorist attacks, another jihadist threat is growing right here in America--in plain sight.\n\nIn Stealth Jihad, Islam expert and New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer blows the whistle on a long-term plot by Islamic jihadists to undermine the United States. This effort aims not to bring America to its knees through attacks with guns or bombs, but to subvert the country from within--by gradually Islamizing America. The ultimate goal, the stealth jihadists themselves declare, is nothing less than the adoption of Islamic law in the United States.\nDescribing the disturbing ease with which stealth jihadists have already become ensconced in the American political and media landscapes, Spencer exposes the full modus operandi of the movement as revealed in a stunning document unveiled in a recent terrorism funding trial. In this unsettling book, he explains:\n\n* Which Islamic fundamentalist organization is behind the stealth jihad \n* How stealth jihadists have reinvented themselves as mainstream civil rights activists--despite their many past declarations of Islamic supremacism \n* How stealth jihadists played a key role in formulating U.S. government guidelines for the War on Terror \n* How insistence on &quot;accommodating&quot; Islamic cultural and religious practices in America is part of a calculated strategy to achieve a dangerous larger agenda \n* The effort by stealth jihadists to whitewash the teaching of Islam in schools \n* What can be done to defeat the stealth jihad and preserve America's liberty\n\nAmerica, Spencer demonstrates, is all but oblivious to a new kind of threat presented by a loosely organized movement whose activists are well funded, highly motivated, and relentless in pursuit of their agenda. This book is a wake-up call for a country so focused on foreign threats that it has left itself vulnerable to a growing danger much closer to home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd1f53ac95604c952aea2e587be994e66c17efb","amp;dn":"Stealth+Jihad+by+Robert+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd1f53ac95604c952aea2e587be994e66c17efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,209,245,58,201,86,4,201,82,174,162,229,135,190,153,78,102,193,126,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
