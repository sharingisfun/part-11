Someone else will need to step up and take over (next episode is June 14, 2014).\n\n\nI am stopping Pokemon for many reasons.\n1. I don't like Pokemon\n2. Capping in general is taking up way too much of my free time, so why cap something I don't like? (I'm stopping other shows too)\n3. It seems like a TON of Pokemon stuff eventually gets released on DVD.. and I've (usually) made it a point not to cap things that will be released to buy.\n\n\nFor the couple of people begging (sometimes more like nagging) me to continue, please stop. I wanted to quit Pokemon around episode 3, but held out this long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde61d3a1c96da5aba59c7caed5b9d3628bb73f6","amp;dn":"Pokemon.XY.S17E17.A.Rush.of.Ninja.Wisdom.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde61d3a1c96da5aba59c7caed5b9d3628bb73f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,230,29,58,28,150,218,90,186,89,199,202,237,91,157,54,40,187,115,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
