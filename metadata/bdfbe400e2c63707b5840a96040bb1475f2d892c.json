The songs are more tuneful and produced, the overall ambiance is more nostalgic and reflective and Humphrey&amp;#039;s vocals show a greater range of emotion. The result is an arguably stronger collection of songs, beginning with the pretty, open-sounding title track. The lead single, Don&amp;#039;t Walk Past, was the band&amp;#039;s most commercially successful song. It is very much a product of its time, with its slinky dance-pop sound. This is 320k Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfbe400e2c63707b5840a96040bb1475f2d892c","amp;dn":"Blue+Peter+-+Falling+%5B1983+New+Wave+%2B+Vertigo+EP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfbe400e2c63707b5840a96040bb1475f2d892c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,251,228,0,226,198,55,7,181,132,10,150,4,11,177,71,95,45,137,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
