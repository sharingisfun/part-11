Here, the story concerns a woman called Lumi, who on the notable date of September 11th, 2019, became the first person born in space on the International Space Station. After her death, all her memories and that which defined her was recorded and archived. Two hundred years later, the collected memories, and essence so to speak, are recreated within the confines of Eden--which is the name by which the internet is known in the future. And herein lies all the collected knowledge of human history.\n\nThe game features five stages, leaderboards, and loads of unlockables such as visual and sound filters to affect and mix up the gameplay. There are also unlockable art and video galleries, and other items to ramp up the replay \nvalue for players. Stages also measure Purification rates (percentage of enemies cleared), and star-based ratings for each stage. Each playthrough of a stage is ranked from one to five stars, and collected stars are used to unlock the stages.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOnly use DVD Decrypter or Imgburn to burn with respected media.\n\n\nIf using DVD Decrypter make sure Layer Break (For DL Media) is at 1913760 user specified option.
