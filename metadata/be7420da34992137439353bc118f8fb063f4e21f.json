ATTENTION !!!\r\n\r\nThis file, kills processes, patches registry values, deletes items from Task Scheduler, deletes binaries, etc. So it is HIGHLY possible your antivirus will face it as a virus. This is absolutely normal! Exclude it from virus scanning and let it do its thing.\r\n\r\nIf you don't trust it, then just do not use it, but please do not report it as a virus, because other people, advanced users, may want to use it anyway, and by reporting it, it gets deleted and thus you cut them off from using it. \r\nThanks in advance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7420da34992137439353bc118f8fb063f4e21f","amp;dn":"remove+Get+Windows10+notification","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7420da34992137439353bc118f8fb063f4e21f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,116,32,218,52,153,33,55,67,147,83,188,17,143,143,176,99,244,226,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
