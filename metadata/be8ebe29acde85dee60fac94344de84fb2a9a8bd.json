As such, I've undertaken to correct this great musical injustice under the U2 Revisited banner. \n\nThere are two versions: this extended edition for your mp3 players and a CD edition that'll actually fit on 2 cds. Thus, there will be two separate torrents.\n\nEach edition will contain both a main 'disc' of A-sides and a second one of B-sides and remixes. \n\nCareful consideration was made to best represent all the albums fairly and offer a worthy summation of U2's output in that decade. While the Extended Edition is more ideal, the slimmed down CD Edition must, alas, be left with only the most crucial tracks. \n\n\nWhichever edition you choose, I hope you enjoy The Best Of 2000-2010 &amp; B-Sides and, *please*, send your thoughts to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;401572122536293329342524002d21292c6e232f2d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; (or post them here) and share this with your fellow U2 fans!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nU2 Best Of 2000-2010 &amp; B-Sides (Extended Edition)\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBest Of 2000-2010\n\n1   City Of Blinding Lights  5:37\n2   Elevation (Tomb Raider Mix)  3:38\n3   Magnificent  5:20\n4   The Ground Beneath Her Feet  3:45\n5   Window In The Skies  4:07\n6   Kite  4:26\n7   No Line On The Horizon  4:08\n8   Walk On (Acoustic Version) 4:24\n9   Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own (Single Version) 4:43\n10  Mercy  6:29\n11  Stateless  4:07\n12  The Saints Are Coming 3:22\n13  Vertigo 3:13\n14  Get On Your Boots 3:13\n15  Love And Peace Or Else  4:50 \n16  Fast Cars 3:42\n17  Winter (Brothers OST Mix) 5:03\n18  Original Of The Species (Acoustic Version) 4:02\n19  Moment Of Surrender 7:20\n20  Yahweh 4:41\n\n\n\n1   Electrical Storm (Nahas &amp; Kessler Dub Remake)  8:03 \n2   Magnificent (Rac Mix)  5:13 \n3   Elevation (Paul Van Dyk Remix) 8:04 \n4   City Of Blinding Lights (White Label Mix)  5:33 \n5   Beautiful Day (The Perfector Mix)  7:50 \n6   Miracle Drug (Redanka Miracle Mix) 7:51 \n7   In A Little While (Nightmare On Wax Remix)  5:14 \n8   Always  3:46 \n9   Smile 3:16 \n10  Original Of The Species (Killahurtz Casa De Angeles Mix) 5:14 \n11  Love You Like Mad  4:17 \n12  Flower Child 4:54 \n13  A Man And A Woman (Acoustic ) 4:27 \n14  Are You Gonna Wait Forever 3:48  \n15  All Because Of You (Killahurtz Fly Mix) 5:40 \n16  New York (Nice Mix) 5:46 \n17  Vertigo (Redanka Power Mix) 7:31 \n18  I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\n    (Christopher Lawrence Bootleg Dub Mix)  7:13 \n19  Get On Your Boots (Justice Remix)  3:27 \n20  Neon Lights 4:07\n\n[1:51:22]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Through legal fair use allowances, this project is meant only for audiences owning existing copies of the original work.
