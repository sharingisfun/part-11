It features every extant note Parker recorded for the Verve label as well as his appearances at Jazz at the Philharmonic. Parker recorded for Verve primarily in the last five years of his life, a period during which, besides playing with his famous quintet, he experimented with strings, Afro-Cuban jazz and mixed chorus. Among the albums produced during ParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Verve years were Bird &amp; Diz, Charlie Parker with Strings, and Swedish Schnapps.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    Original 10 CD release Bird: The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve, 1990 (Verve)\n\nDisc: 4\n\n1-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just FriendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n2-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything Happens to MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n3-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“April In ParisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:06\n4-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“SummertimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n5-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Didn't Know What Time It WasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n6-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Should Lose YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n7-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star EyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n8-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues (Fast)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n9-   Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'm In The Mood For LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n10-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“BloomdidoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n11-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“And Oscar For TreadwellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n12-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“An Oscar For TreadwellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n13-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MohawkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n14-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“MohawkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 6 (Take 4) Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n15-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Melancholy BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n16-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Melancholy BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Coda Rehearsal) - :05\n17-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Melancholy BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n18-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Incomplete) - :27\n19-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Incomplete) - :18\n20-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Incomplete) - :40\n21-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 Incomplete) - :18\n22-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:33\n23-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 6 Incomplete) - :24\n24-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 7 Incomplete) - :14\n25-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 8 (Take 4) Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n26-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 9 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:06\n27-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 10 Incomplete) - :43\n28-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leap FrogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 11 (Take 6) Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n29-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Incomplete) - :35\n30-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Incomplete) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:08\n31-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 False start) - :08\n32-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 4 (Take 2) Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n33-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 Incomplete) - :25\n34-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Relaxing With LeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 6 (Take 3) Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be9e49700e8aad8b6608c961f701cb2fc076574a","amp;dn":"Bird+-+The+Complete+Charlie+Parker+on+Verve+vol.+4+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be9e49700e8aad8b6608c961f701cb2fc076574a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,158,73,112,14,138,173,139,102,8,201,97,247,1,203,47,192,118,87,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
