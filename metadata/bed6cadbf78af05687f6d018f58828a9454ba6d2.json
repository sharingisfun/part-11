They said I wouldn't return, but I did.  You can see the bits and bytes have aged well.  Like fine wine, they are good for sipping.  Please don't forget dinner tomorrow at eight o'clock.\n\n\n*************\n\n\nI believe in quality torrents; if for any reason you do not find this torrent to be satisfactory, please let me know in the comments.  If you like this music please support the artist(s) and purchase it!  If the album is out of print, please support the artist by buying releases that are not out of print, or by buying merchandise from their official store.  The contents of this torrent are for sampling purposes only.  Enjoy!\n\n\n*************\n\n\nDue to the underground nature of Christian unblack metal, I have decided to put together some torrents to give you an opportunity to sample the material.  I plan on doing a series of three torrents if the first one goes well, all containing 7 albums each (for the number of perfection, 777).  The music will also get progressively more obscure.  For example:  part 1 is the &quot;A list&quot; (it will have the most popular unblack metal), but part 3 (the &quot;C list&quot;) will have lesser known unblack artists/albums.  Bit rate is highest when possible.  I WILL ONLY RELEASE THE NEXT TWO PARTS IF PEOPLE SEED.  YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.\n\n\n*************\n\n\nTHE CONTENTS (all MP3 format plus 300 x 300 album cover JPEG, alphabetical order):\n\n1. Antestor - The Forsaken (unblack metal, 320kbs)\n2. Crimson Moonlight - Veil Of Remembrance (unblack metal, 320kbs)\n3. Extol - Undeceived (unblack metal, 320kbs)\n4. Grave Declaration - When Dying Souls Scream Praise (symphonic unblack metal, 320kbs)\n5. A Hill To Die Upon - Omens (unblackened death metal, 320kbs)\n6. Horde - Hellig Usvart (unblack metal, 320kbs, 1 bonus track 256kbs)\n7. Slechtvalk - A Forlorn Throne (unblackened death metal, 320kbs)\n\nINTRODUCTORY BONUS ALBUM (available for an unlimited time only):\n\nAntestor - Omen (unblack metal, 320kbs)\n\n\n*************\n\nYours truly\n\nFLAC the Ripper\n\nDon't mind me giving the trade name\n\n*************&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d8beb4b9bbacb0bdaab1a8a8bdaa98bfb5a0f6bbb7b5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;*************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed6cadbf78af05687f6d018f58828a9454ba6d2","amp;dn":"Unblack+Metal+21+Albums+Antestor+Crimson+Moonlight+etc+pt+1+of+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed6cadbf78af05687f6d018f58828a9454ba6d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,214,202,219,247,138,240,86,135,246,208,24,245,136,40,169,69,75,166,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
