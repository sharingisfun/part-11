Forty thousand murdered since 2006; police chiefs shot within hours of taking office; mass graves comparable to those of civil wars; car bombs shattering storefronts; headless corpses heaped in town squares. And it is all because a few Americans are getting high. Or is it part of a worldwide shadow economy that threatens Mexico's democracy? The United States throws Black Hawk helicopters, DEA assistance, and lots of money at the problem. But in secret, Washington is at a loss. Who are these mysterious figures who threaten Mexico's democracy? What is El Narco?\n\nEl Narco is not a gang; it is a movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands, from bullet-riddled barrios to marijuana-covered mountains. The conflict spawned by El Narco has given rise to paramilitary death squads battling from Guatemala to the Texas border (and sometimes beyond). In this &quot;propulsive ... high-octane&quot; book (Publishers Weekly), Ioan Grillo draws the first definitive portrait of Mexico's cartels and how they have radically transformed in the past decade.\n\nPublisher \tBloomsbury Press; 1 edition (November 13, 2012)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t9781608194018\nISBN-13 \t978-1608194018\nASIN \t1608194019\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NanAcaAEI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NanAcaAEI&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/El-Narco-Mexicos-Criminal-Insurgency/dp/1608194019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372468843&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=el+narco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/El-Narco-Mexicos-Criminal-Insurgency/dp/1608194019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372468843&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=el+narco&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf841dc1618037318179159271ee52ba4827b156","amp;dn":"El+Narco%3A+Inside+Mexico%27s+Criminal+Insurgency+-+epub-+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf841dc1618037318179159271ee52ba4827b156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,132,29,193,97,128,55,49,129,121,21,146,113,238,82,186,72,39,177,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
