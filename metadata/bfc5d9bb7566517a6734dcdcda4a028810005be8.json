Historian Dr Alice Garner visits Victoria's notorious Cheviot Beach, reliving the fateful day Australia lost its prime minister to these waters. Neil travels to Phillip Island, and reveals how an entire town was removed to save the penguins. Landscape architect Brendan Moar tackles the tricky sport of Blo-Karting along the flat sands of Waratah Bay. On the Gippsland Lakes, marine ecologist Professor Emma Johnston hunts for a brand new species of dolphin, and finally Neil takes to the skies with aviatrix Judy Pay for an unforgettable tour of the Bass Strait coast in a fully-restored warbird.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a3ebcac4cbe3ef978d92&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3013 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 50mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.10 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc5d9bb7566517a6734dcdcda4a028810005be8","amp;dn":"Coast.Australia.Series.2.1of8.Skull.Rock.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc5d9bb7566517a6734dcdcda4a028810005be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,197,217,187,117,102,81,122,103,52,220,220,218,74,2,136,16,0,91,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
