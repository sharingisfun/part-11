He graduated from Yale College and received an MA in English from Stanford University. For more than twenty years he was an investment professional until he retired in 2013 in order to write full time. \n\nHis 2011 novel, Rules of Civility, was a New York Times bestseller and has been translated into fifteen languages. He lives with his wife and two children in Manhattan and serves on the boards of the Library of America, the Yale Art Gallery, and the Wallace Foundation.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction\n\n\nRules of Civility: &quot;Terrific. A smart, witty, charming dry-martini of a novel&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€David Nicholls\nSet during the hazy, enchanting, and martini-filled world of New York City circa 1938, Rules of Civility follows three friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€Katey, Eve, and TinkerÃ¢â‚¬â€from their chance meeting at a jazz club on New Year's Eve through a year of enlightening and occasionally tragic adventures. Tinker orbits in the world of the wealthy; Katey and Eve stretch their few dollars out each evening on the town. While all three are complex characters, Katey is the story's shining star. She is a fully realized heroine, unique in her strong sense of self amidst her life's continual fluctuations. Towles' writing also paints an inviting picture of New York City, without forgetting its sharp edges. Reminiscent of Fitzgerald, Rules of Civility is full of delicious sentences you can sit back and savor (most appropriately with a martini or two). Ã¢â‚¬â€Caley Anderson\n\nEve in Hollywood: Near the end of Amor TowlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling novel Rules of Civility, the fiercely independent Evelyn Ross boards a train from New York to Chicago to visit her parents, but never disembarks. Six months later, she appears in a photograph in a gossip magazine exiting the Tropicana Club in Los Angeles on the arm of Olivia de Havilland.\n\nIn this chain of six richly detailed and atmospheric stories, each told from a different perspective, Towles unfolds the events that take Eve to the heart of Old Hollywood. Beginning in the dining car of the Golden State Limited in September 1938, we follow Eve to the elegant rooms of the Beverly Hills Hotel, the fabled tables of AntonioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, the amusement parks on the Santa Monica piers, the afro-Cuban dance clubs of Central Avenue, and ultimately the set of Gone with The Wind.\n\nWith the glamour and grit of the studio systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s golden age as a backdrop, Towles introduces in each story a memorable new character whose fate may well be altered by their encounter with Eve. In following the thread of these varied encounters, we watch as Eve forges a new and unexpected life for herself in late 1930s Los Angeles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe851a444d0ab10495f59f1fd889727def04096","amp;dn":"Rules+of+Civility+series+by+Amor+Towles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe851a444d0ab10495f59f1fd889727def04096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,232,81,164,68,208,171,16,73,95,89,241,253,136,151,39,222,240,64,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
