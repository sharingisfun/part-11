He is best known for his &quot;Big Appetites&quot; photographs series, in which tiny, detailed human figures pose in real food environments. His photos have been published in dozens of countries around the world, and are displayed in galleries and private collections in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.\n\nIn 2012 Boffoli sued Twitter for copyright infringement and for ignoring Digital Millennium Copyright Act requests to take his photos down from Twitter servers. After a suit was filed in federal court, Twitter and Boffoli settled out of court.\n\nHe also sued Google, and Imgur (2014). DMCA takedowns all over pages like tumblr is what you can find.\n\nI had to create an ISO file for the &quot;Albums&quot; folder, because the .torrent file was 4.4MB no matter what piece size I had, there is too many jpg's, also with .iso you can open and see what's in there without uncompressing it (like zip, or rar).\n\nEnjoy! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff8c54651b7adb0a731560a3ab93f1f7b57935d","amp;dn":"Christopher+Boffoli+%28Big+Appetites+included%29+20754+images","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff8c54651b7adb0a731560a3ab93f1f7b57935d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,248,197,70,81,183,173,176,167,49,86,10,58,185,63,31,123,87,147,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
