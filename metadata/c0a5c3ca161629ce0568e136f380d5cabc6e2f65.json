Secession consisted of Peter J. Thomson, Carole L. Branston, Charlie D. Kelly, and J.L. Seenan. Their singer, Peter J. Thomson, who penned their most commercially successful song song &quot;Touch (Part 3)&quot;, died in the late 1990s.\n\nA Dark Enchantment was their only release on CD; this CD is prized by collectors of rare 1980s music. It&amp;#039;s interesting to know that the single &quot;Sneakyville&quot; A popular dance club hit, was about the Charles Manson Family murders. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 - Eventide\n02 - Promise\n03 - Love Lies Bleeding\n04 - Sneakyville\n05 - Winifred\n06 - The Box That Holds a Secret\n07 - Ocean Blue\n08 - Radioland\n09 - The Magician\n10 - Love Lies Bleeding\n11 - The Wolf\n12 - Eventide (Theme from A Dark Enchantment)\n13 - All The Animals Come Out at Night\n14 - Michael\n15 - Havoc\n16 - Promise\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a5c3ca161629ce0568e136f380d5cabc6e2f65","amp;dn":"Secession+-+A+Dark+Enchantment+%5B1987+Rare+Synthpop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a5c3ca161629ce0568e136f380d5cabc6e2f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,165,195,202,22,22,41,206,5,104,225,54,243,128,213,202,188,110,47,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
