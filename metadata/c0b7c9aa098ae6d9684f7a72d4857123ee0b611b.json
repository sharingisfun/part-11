So being on deadline the week of her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as rough as it sounds. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one hitch: BeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assignment is to write a review of a sex position manual, but she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a plus one to play with.\n\nThe good news: Ben, the one who got away back in college, is also attending stag--and he's as temptingly gorgeous as ever.\n\nThe bad news: Ben turned down BeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offer of graduation night sex five years ago.\n\nThe best news: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not planning on making the same mistake twiceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBiography\nTiffany Reisz lives in Lexington, Kentucky with her boyfriend and two cats (one that may or may not be the Anti-Christ). She graduated with a B.A. in English from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and is making both her parents and her professors proud by writing erotica under her real name. \n\nTiffany has six piercings, one tattoo, and has been arrested twice. When not under arrest, Tiffany enjoys Latin Dance, Latin Men, and Latin Verbs. She dropped out of a conservative southern seminary in order to pursue her dream of becoming a smut peddler. Johnny Depp's aunt was her fourth grade teacher. There is little to nothing interesting about her. \n\nIf she couldn't write, she would die.\n\nwww.tiffanyreisz.com/storytime\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0b7c9aa098ae6d9684f7a72d4857123ee0b611b","amp;dn":"Misbehaving+By+Tiffany+Reisz+%28Epub%2CMobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0b7c9aa098ae6d9684f7a72d4857123ee0b611b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,183,201,170,9,138,230,217,104,79,122,114,212,133,113,35,238,11,97,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
