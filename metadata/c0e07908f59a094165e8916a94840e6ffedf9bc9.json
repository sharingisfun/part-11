Volume 1 brings you everything in public existence from 1989-1992. Countless hours of research has been put into this project, ensuring the most accurate archive possible. The highest quality sources available were always used. Every file is a 320 kbps MP3, with 600x600 pixel cover art in the style of the original DMBLive cover art for non-official releases. Everything has been carefully tagged so all ID3 tags are consistent, and most importantly, correct. Coming soon... Volume 2: 1993.
