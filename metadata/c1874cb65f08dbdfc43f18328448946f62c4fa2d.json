This year is going to be murder.\n\nLiving in the bleak majesty of Kathmandu, Zan Jensen is an American expatriate on the run from a scandalous past. Working for a fly-by-night adventure consulting service, Zan escorts tourists and thrill-seekers up the Himalayas' tallest and deadliest peaks. Along with Haskell Price, fellow climbing guide and mentor, the two partner up in a more sinister line of work: high-altitude grave robbing. Stripping the bodies they find left at deadly altitudes of personal effects and right hands, Zan and Haskell shake down the families and friends of the dead for a hefty body return fee. When Price stumbles across the decades-old corpse of Sullivan Mars below the peak of Mount Everest, it puts the partners in the crosshairs of a global mystery that someone is all too willing to kill to keep secret.\n\nThe first chapter of a new crime thriller that stretches from rural America to the roof of the world from Christopher Sebela (Screamland: Death of the Party, Captain Marvel) and Ibrahim Moustafa (The Pound: Ghoul's Night Out).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1874cb65f08dbdfc43f18328448946f62c4fa2d","amp;dn":"HIGH+CRIMES+001+%282013%29+%28Monkeybrain%29+%28digital%29+%28Son+of+Ultron-Em","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1874cb65f08dbdfc43f18328448946f62c4fa2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,135,76,182,95,8,219,223,196,63,24,50,132,72,148,111,98,196,250,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
