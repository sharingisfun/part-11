Also included is a Practical Electronics-sourced booklet for the 'Magnum' metal detector (which I built), and the source-code for a ETI project (which I also built!) and whose bug-laden firmware I also debugged &amp; recompiled - of interest only to myself and the original author no doubt, but included here for completeness.  There's even the hard-to-read commented source-code for this included in the mix.\n\nNOTE: This scans are NOT of high-quality!  My Canon scanner software is sh&amp;t, allowing only 2 'quality' settings, the highest producing files almost 10 times the size.  So if this is a consideration, first download one or two issues and check them out before bitching about the quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ef303b403df2c819118253bb6f64e4e654646d","amp;dn":"56+Electronics+Today+International+%28ETI%29+Magazines.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ef303b403df2c819118253bb6f64e4e654646d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,239,48,59,64,61,242,200,25,17,130,83,187,111,100,228,230,84,100,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
