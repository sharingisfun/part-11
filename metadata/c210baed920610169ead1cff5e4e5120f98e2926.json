It is Isaac  Newton  meets  M.  C.\nEscher. Manipulate gravity to redefine the  ceiling\nas the floor  while  venturing  through  impossible\narchitectures.   Explore   increasingly   difficult\nworlds, each  uniquely  detailed  and  designed  to\nleave you with a pronounced sense  of  intellectual\naccomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as  an\nart form, with beautifully hand-drawn  art  in  the\nstyle of a black-and-white lithograph.\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir\n4- Go To Hell!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c210baed920610169ead1cff5e4e5120f98e2926","amp;dn":"The+Bridge+MULTi17-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c210baed920610169ead1cff5e4e5120f98e2926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,16,186,237,146,6,16,22,158,173,28,255,94,78,81,32,249,142,41,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
