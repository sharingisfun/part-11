This unique handbook provides information on composting, soil fertility and microorganisms, alternative graywater systems and much more. It also gives detailed instructions on how you can build your own sawdust toilet and compost bins for only a few dollars. The Humanure Handbook lists sources of composting toilets worldwide, includes a review of U.S. state regulations, is richly illustrated with both technical drawings as well as humorous cartoons, and is full of reader feedback from the first edition.\n\nDefecating in our drinking water is perhaps one of our culture's most curious, but least talked about, habits. This book gives compelling and detailed testimony as to why humanure should be constructively recycled:\n\n    * to prevent water pollution (almost 4 trillion gallons of sewage effluent are dumped into our coastal waterways each year);\n    * to fertilize the soil (rich in soil nutrients, humanure can be safely recycled by thermophilic composting);\n    * to protect our dwindling drinking water supplies (nearly 1/3 of all household drinking water is used to flush toilets); and\n    * to enhance our health. Fertile soil not only grows great veggies, but nourishes our health and community's well-being.\n\n\nISBN:\n    9780964425835\nSubtitle:\n    A Guide to Composting Human Manure\nAuthor:\n    Jenkins, Joseph\nAuthor:\n    Jenkins, Joseph C.\nPublisher:\n    Jenkins Publishing (PA)\nSubject:\n    Organic\nSubject:\n    Life Sciences - Ecology - Recycling\nSubject:\n    Ecology\nEdition Number:\n    3\nEdition Description:\n    Trade paper\nPublication Date:\n    September 2005\nBinding:\n    Paperback\nGrade Level:\n    General/trade\nLanguage:\n    English\nIllustrations:\n    Y\nPages:\n    255\nDimensions:\n    9.24x6.34x.66 in. .93 lbs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c265bfeb9d59e8dbb953f1c288439f7ae0ed4ec2","amp;dn":"humanure_handbook_third_edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c265bfeb9d59e8dbb953f1c288439f7ae0ed4ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,101,191,235,157,89,232,219,185,83,241,194,136,67,159,122,224,237,78,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
