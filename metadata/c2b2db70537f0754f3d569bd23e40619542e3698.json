Released in 1984, the album peaked at no.16 on the UK album chart and was certified Silver by the BPI.  The group continued their association with producers Jolley &amp; Swain (who had produced some tracks on their debut album, Deep Sea Skiving). With this album, Bananarama had their first significant U.S. success with the single &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, which became a top ten hit there (the song had also been a top 10 hit in the UK in 1983), bolstered by the song's inclusion in the soundtrack to the movie The Karate Kid. Further hits from the album included &quot;Robert De Niro's Waiting...&quot; (UK #3) and &quot;Rough Justice&quot; (UK #23). The track &quot;Hot Line to Heaven&quot; was also released as a single in the UK but failed to reach the top 40, peaking at #58.  The original vinyl release came in an embossed sleeve and included a poster which, as well as the album lyrics and a photo of each member of the group, contained the message: &quot;Well, a year is a long time, people change &amp; maybe we have too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hopefully for the better! Anyway here are results of our hard work over the past twelve months. This is for you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we hope you like it. Best Wishes, love Keren X, All the best, love Sarah x, and Lots of love, Siobhan xx&quot;.  The album was dedicated to the memory of their friend Thomas Ã¢â‚¬ËœKidsoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Reilly, who had recently been killed in Belfast.[citation needed]  On 19 March 2007 Bananarama's first six studio albums were re-issued by Rhino Records. All re-issues are remastered and each includes several bonus tracks, consisting of B-sides and remixes..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Cruel Summer\n[02] Rough Justice\n[03] King Of The Jungle\n[04] Dream Baby\n[05] Link\n[06] Hot Line To Heaven\n[07] State I'm In\n[08] Robert De Niro's Waiting\n[09] Through A Child's Eye\n[10] Cairo\n[11] Push!\n[12] Rough Justice (Single Version)\n[13] Live Now\n[14] Hot Line To Heaven\n[15] The Wild Life\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:56m:36s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 137mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
