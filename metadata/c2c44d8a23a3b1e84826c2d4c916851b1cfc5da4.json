This year marks the 40th Anniversary of Jimi's legendary performance (including the famous guitar on fire sequence).\n\n\nThe DVD has been digitally remastered and mixed in 5.1 Surround Sound by Jimi's original sound recording engineer, Eddie Kramer. The picture quality is sharp as a razor, almost impeccable. The original analogue recording mixed in 5.1 is raw, punchy, supersonic and exciting.\n\n\nThe film footage is crystal clear, almost three dimensional and there is no sign of grain. It's as if Hendrix is jumping out of your LCD or Plasma screen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c44d8a23a3b1e84826c2d4c916851b1cfc5da4","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+Experience%3ALive+At+Monterey%5B2007+DVD-9%5D%5BSCANS%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c44d8a23a3b1e84826c2d4c916851b1cfc5da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,196,77,138,35,163,177,232,72,38,194,212,201,22,133,27,28,252,93,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
