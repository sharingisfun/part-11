He is plagued by severe neck pain. His father is bedeviled by water first leaking into his bedroom and then flooding the apartment; rain is incessant. Xiao-kang&amp;#039;s mother is overcome by sexual longing for her son, sometimes making seemingly incestuous overtures. They try virtually every intervention for Xiao-kang&amp;#039;s neck: Western medicine, a chiropractor, acupuncture, an herbal doctor, and a faith healer, Master Liu. Are the family&amp;#039;s silent dynamics\nand Xiao-kang&amp;#039;s neck pain connected? And what about the body floating in the Tamsui River: is everything dead?[/color]\n\n\n\nImdb...............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119263/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2e534749bba6cd87bac21c3155fe788428335d5","amp;dn":"He+liu+a.k.a+The+River+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2e534749bba6cd87bac21c3155fe788428335d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,229,52,116,155,186,108,216,123,172,33,195,21,95,231,136,66,131,53,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
