All of it. As a bonus, I also threw in five bootleg albums: Kingston Advice, If Music Could Talk Vol. 1 &amp; 2, Going To The Disco, and The Rat patrol From Ft. Bragg. I worked very hard on making this the most complete The Clash collection on the whole of the interbutts; enjoy it hard!\n\nWhat does full metadata mean? It means the album art, year of release, track numbers etc. are all embedded in the metadata of the mp3s themselves - it's all there, and you can see it from most media player programs. This means if you import the songs into iTunes, you can sort them by year, and use coverflow without adding the artwork yourself!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f54aecbfffd3dc98e0884c36ad0825474c97da","amp;dn":"The+Clash+Discography+-+FULL+METADATA%2C+5+BOOTLEG+ALBUMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f54aecbfffd3dc98e0884c36ad0825474c97da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,245,74,236,191,255,211,220,152,224,136,76,54,173,8,37,71,76,151,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
