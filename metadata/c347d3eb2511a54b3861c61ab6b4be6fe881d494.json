Friend. Niece. Daughter. Thief. But for the last two months sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply been known as the girl who ran the crew that robbed the greatest museum in the world. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why Kat isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t surprised when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asked to steal the infamous Cleopatra Emerald so it can be returned to its rightful owners.\n\nThere are only three problems. First, the gem hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been seen in public in thirty years. Second, since the fall of the Egyptian empire and the suicide of Cleopatra, no one who holds the emerald keeps it for long, and in KatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, history almost always repeats itself. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the third problem that makes KatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crew the most nervous and that is simplyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the emerald is cursed.\n\nKat might be in way over her head, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going down without a fight. After all she has her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â€the gorgeous HaleÃ¢â‚¬â€and the rest of her crew with her as they chase the Cleopatra around the globe, dodging curses, realizing that the same tricks and cons her family has used for centuries are useless this time.\n\nWhich means, this time, Katarina Bishop is making up her own rules.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c347d3eb2511a54b3861c61ab6b4be6fe881d494","amp;dn":"Uncommon+Criminals+-+Ally+Carter.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c347d3eb2511a54b3861c61ab6b4be6fe881d494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,71,211,235,37,17,165,75,56,97,198,26,182,180,190,111,232,129,212,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
