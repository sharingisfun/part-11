Strickland pursues his dream to the extent of leaving his family, betraying his friends and associates, and living a life of unending hedonism in Tahiti. Undeniably brilliant as a painter, Strickland is also a good-for-nothing, until he is forced to confront himself on the threshold of death. Herbert Marshall plays Geoffrey Wolfe, who narrates the story as he attempts to make some sense of Strickland's creative ways.\n\n\n1944 Oscar nominee for best music\n\n\nContains two full versions of the movie - the original theatrical release in B&amp;W/&quot;COLOR&quot;, plus the full black &amp; white version!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c38dfa135df8573b06403b7748a165e371188110","amp;dn":"The+Moon+and+Sixpence+%281942%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c38dfa135df8573b06403b7748a165e371188110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,141,250,19,93,248,87,59,6,64,59,119,72,161,101,227,113,24,129,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
