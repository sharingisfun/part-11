The album will also include a brand new track entitled, She Knows Me co-written with his long-term writing partner Jim Vallance. The Adams/Vallance partnership was responsible for many of Bryan s classic hits including Heaven , Summer of 69 and Run To You .\n&quot;Making the selection of the songs for the album took a long time&quot; noted Bryan. &quot;We recorded all kinds of songs until the songs sort of presented themselves, or sounded different enough from the originals. We did about 3 months of recording, spread out over the course of 2 years. Radio was king when I was a teenager,&quot; Adams reflected, &quot;you'd hear McCarney's &quot;Admiral Halsey&quot; straight into &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot; by the Manhattans. Radio didn't discriminate back then&quot;.\n&quot;Tracks of My Years&quot; is an eclectic mix of songs reflective of the time when rock was played alongside pop, country and R&amp;B, and follows Adams critically acclaimed acoustic album, 2010 s &quot;Bare Bones&quot;, a release that resulted in sold out shows across Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa. - AMAZON\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 118 MiB\nDuration                                 : 51mn 23s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Tracks Of My Years (Deluxe)\nPerformer                                : Bryan Adams\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Universal Music Group / Badman Limited\nGenre                                    : General Mainstream Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nComment                                  : Callixtus\n2nd Genre                                : Adult Contemporary\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 51mn 23s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n===TRACKLISTING===\n\n\n01.
