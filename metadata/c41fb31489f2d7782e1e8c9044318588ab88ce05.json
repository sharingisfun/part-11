By coincidence, the bunker is a store house and they have enough food and wine to last them for years. And they are trapped for years. The film analyzes how they deal with their underground prison, with their relationships, and with death.\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 1.22 GiB\nDuration : 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 899 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID : H264\nWidth : 672 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.253\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate : 256 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41fb31489f2d7782e1e8c9044318588ab88ce05","amp;dn":"The+Blockhouse+%281973%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41fb31489f2d7782e1e8c9044318588ab88ce05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,31,179,20,137,242,215,120,46,30,140,144,68,49,133,136,171,136,206,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
