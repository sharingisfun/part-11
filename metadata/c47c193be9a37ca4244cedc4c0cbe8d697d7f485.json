Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. This expansion will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles. \r\n\r\nLeisure specialization: \r\nCommercial areas can specialize in leisure activities. Leisure areas are especially active during the night, but work like regular commercial areas during the day. \r\n\r\nTourist specialization: \r\nCommercial areas such as bars and restaurants, small marina and fishing tours on the shoreline can specialize in beach activities. \r\n\r\nExpanded City Services: \r\nCriminals will now be taken to Prison from Police buildings. \r\nTaxi service will help citizens and tourists travel around the city. \r\nCargo hubs are harbors that accept cargo trains straight to the terminal. \r\nInternational airport is a huge airport, allowing much more traffic than the previous airport and has a metro station attached to it. \r\nBus terminal allows citizens to transfer to other bus lines in the terminal building.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 (64-bit) \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo, 3.0GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+, 3.2GHz \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards) \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0 \r\nHard Drive: 1 GB available space\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED: \r\nOS: Microsoft Windows 7/8 (64-bit) \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-3470, 3.20GHz or AMD FX-6300, 3.5Ghz \r\nMemory: 6 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: nVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB (Does not support Intel Integrated Graphics Cards) \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nHard Drive: 1 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c47c193be9a37ca4244cedc4c0cbe8d697d7f485","amp;dn":"Cities.Skylines.Deluxe.Edition.v1.2.0.F3.Incl.After.Dark.DLC-ALI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c47c193be9a37ca4244cedc4c0cbe8d697d7f485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,124,25,59,233,163,124,164,36,76,237,196,192,203,232,214,151,215,244,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
