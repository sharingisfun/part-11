Sure, this is Southern\nrock at heart; but the concept is universal: just take what the world gives you\nand make that work. &quot;This album is the culmination of all of the everyday ups\nand downs life throws at you,&quot; says the band. &quot;Sonically, you'll hear some of\nthe meanest sounding guitar riffs we've ever laid down, and at the same time,\nyou'll find ballads that will tug on your heartstrings. We wanted the album's\nintensity to match that of our live show.&quot;\n\nStripped by HeXagon's Advanced NFO Stripper: http://www.stripnfo.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b58f5470114a620757262e2bb27cc5fe5487d7","amp;dn":"Black_Stone_Cherry-Between_The_Devil_And_The_Deep_Blue_Sea-2011-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b58f5470114a620757262e2bb27cc5fe5487d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,181,143,84,112,17,74,98,7,87,38,46,43,178,124,197,254,84,135,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
