In these two episodes, we hear of an account in the first from the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“disc jockeyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who ran the islandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ only radio station, and in the second from a reluctant Argentine recruit, who was glad to be captured by British troops.\n\nNeither aspects of the dispute are commonly covered in the media, which tends to concentrate on the Task Force, thus this makes for interesting listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c1738c7c41d655fdcc1ed3dcadaa6c212189f9","amp;dn":"The+Falklands+War+-+BBC+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c1738c7c41d655fdcc1ed3dcadaa6c212189f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,193,115,140,124,65,214,85,253,204,30,211,220,173,170,108,33,33,137,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
