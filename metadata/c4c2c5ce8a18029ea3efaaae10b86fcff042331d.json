ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why, with obesity rates soaring and fitness levels declining, he wants to give everyone an all-access pass to his premium plan for lifelong fitness. In Formula 50, the mega-successful entertainer and entrepreneur unleashes the power of metabolic resistance training (MRT), the key ingredient that has helped him achieve the famously buff physique that makes his music videos sizzle.\n\nThrough MRT, 50 CentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fitness plan breaks down the barriers between traditional weight training and cardio workouts, accelerating fat loss while building muscle and improving overall fitness. Designed for a six-week rollout for total mind-body transformation, the Formula 50 regimen builds willpower while it builds physical power. In addition to motivation, nutrition is another key element; readers will discover the unique dietary combinations that fuel 50 CentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workouts. Coauthored with Jeff OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connell, health journalist and editor-in-chief at Bodybuilding.com (the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest fitness website), the book delivers a payoff that goes beyond six-pack abs and flab-free pecs: This is a fitness plan that boosts energy, endurance, flexibility, and mobility. The result is a body youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always dreamed ofÃ¢â‚¬â€and the mindset to attain the rest of your dreams.\n\nFormula 50 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ December 27, 2012\nBook Language: English \nPages: 263\nFile Type: Pdf, Epub, Mobi\nFile Size: 30.5 MB\n\nISBN-10: 1583335021\nISBN-13: 978-1583335024\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ClTIZMA.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ClTIZMA.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c2c5ce8a18029ea3efaaae10b86fcff042331d","amp;dn":"Formula+50+by+50+Cent%2C+Jeff+O%27Connell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c2c5ce8a18029ea3efaaae10b86fcff042331d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,194,197,206,138,24,2,158,163,239,170,174,16,184,111,207,240,66,51,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
