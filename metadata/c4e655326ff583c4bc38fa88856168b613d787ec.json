As the cover girl for just about every hard copy gaming magazine this year, this globe-trotting, gun-happy lass had become the matron saint of a new revolution in 3D gaming before the title even hit the shelves. But does the game really live up to all the buildup? Well, seeing is believing when it comes to Tomb Raider, and playing the game with the Rendition or 3Dfx chip, which are sure to find a home soon in every serious gamer&amp;#039;s computer tower (a supportive patch will be available online for these), should almost be a prerequisite. Featuring several stunningly rendered 3D worlds and many a cliff-hanging moment, Tomb Raider makes gamers pay for the whole seat, even though they only need the edge.\n\nLearn more about this legendary game at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider\nReview at: http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/tombraider/review.html\n\n\nFormat:\nMDF (+MDS) file.
