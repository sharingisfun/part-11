Kushner, The Book of Job: When Bad Things Happened to a Good Person. Schocken Books, 2012.\n\nISBN 9780805242928 | 224 pages | ePub\n\nFrom one of our most trusted spiritual advisers, a thoughtful, illuminating guide to that most fascinating of biblical texts, the book of Job, and what it can teach us about living in a troubled world.\n\nThe story of Job is one of unjust things happening to a good man. Yet after losing everything, Job -- though confused, angry, and questioning God -- refuses to reject his faith, although he challenges some central aspects of it. Rabbi Harold S. Kushner examines the questions raised by Job's experience, questions that have challenged wisdom seekers and worshippers for centuries. What kind of God permits such bad things to happen to good people? Why does God test loyal followers? Can a truly good God be all-powerful?\n\nRooted in the text, the critical tradition that surrounds it, and the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own profoundly moral thinking, KushnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study gives us the book of Job as a touchstone for our time. Taking lessons from historical and personal tragedy, Kushner teaches us about what can and cannot be controlled, about the power of faith when all seems dark, and about our ability to find God.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4eb3ec1cd39e63d48d3369e99d96ca0ad441a72","amp;dn":"Harold+Kushner+-+Book+of+Job%3A+When+Bad+Things+Happen...+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4eb3ec1cd39e63d48d3369e99d96ca0ad441a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,235,62,193,205,57,230,61,72,211,54,158,153,217,108,160,173,68,26,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
