As the introduction says, 'clarity of writing usually follows clarity of thought.'\nThe Economist Style Guide gives general advice on writing, points out common errors and clichÃƒÂ©s, offers guidance on consistent use of punctuation, abbreviations and capital letters, and contains an exhaustive range of reference material - covering everything from accountancy ratios and stock market indices to laws of nature and science.\nSome of the numerous useful rules and common mistakes pointed out in the guide include:\n*Which informs, that defines. This is the house that Jack built. But: This house, which Jack built, is now falling down.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Discreet means circumspect or prudent; discrete means separate or distinct. Remember that &quot;Questions are never indiscreet. Answers sometimes are&quot; (Oscar Wilde).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Flaunt means display, flout means disdain. If you flout this distinction you will flaunt your ignorance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Forgo means do without; forego means go before.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fortuitous means accidental, not fortunate or well-timed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Times: Take care. Three times more than X is four times as much as X.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Full stops: Use plenty. They keep sentences short. This helps the reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51faf03254acd903f3c9cc2d7d58e7f6b483f52","amp;dn":"The+Economist+Style+Guide%2C+10th+Ed+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51faf03254acd903f3c9cc2d7d58e7f6b483f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,31,175,3,37,74,205,144,63,60,156,194,215,213,142,127,107,72,63,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
