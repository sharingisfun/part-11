But that technology has been evolving for decades in the hands of hackers and radical activists, from the libertarian enclaves of Northern California to Berlin to the Balkans. And the secret-killing machine continues to evolve beyond WikiLeaks, as a movement of hacktivists aims to obliterate the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s institutional secrecy.\n\nThis is the story of the code and the charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€idealists, anarchists, extremistsÃ¢â‚¬â€who are transforming the next generationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notion of what activism can be.\n\nWith unrivaled access to such major players as Julian Assange, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, and WikiLeaksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shadowy engineer known as the Architect, never before interviewed, reporter Andy Greenberg unveils the world of politically-motivated hackersÃ¢â‚¬â€who they are and how they operate.\n\nPublisher: Dutton Adult (September 13, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0525953205\nISBN-13: 978-0525953203\n\nGet the audio version of this book at following link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8869684/This_Machine_Kills_Secrets__How_WikiLeakers__Cypherpunks__and_Ha&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8869684/This_Machine_Kills_Secrets__How_WikiLeakers__Cypherpunks__and_Ha&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_____________________________________\n                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&lt;/a&gt;\n_____________________________________\n\t\t\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE, LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52b2a0b2e753c74b1fc4b947650d434aa8c3f8c","amp;dn":"This+Machine+Kills+Secrets%3A+How+WikiLeakers%2C+Cypherpunks%2C+and+Ha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52b2a0b2e753c74b1fc4b947650d434aa8c3f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,43,42,11,46,117,60,116,177,252,75,148,118,80,212,52,170,140,63,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
