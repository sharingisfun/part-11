It has been discussed widely amongst the younger generation of Continental philosophers seeking new philosophical approaches and promises to form the cornerstone of future debates in the field. \n\nThis book introduces the contexts out of which speculative realism has emerged and provides an overview of the major contributors and latest developments. It guides the reader through the important questions asked by realism (what can I know? what is reality?), examining philosophy's perennial questions in new ways. The book begins with the speculative realist's critique of 'correlationism', the view that we can never reach what is real beneath our language systems, our means for perception, or our finite manner of being-in-the-world. It goes on to critically review the work of the movement's most important thinkers, including Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, and Graham Harman, but also other important writers such as Jane Bennett and Catherine Malabou whose writings delineate alternative approaches to the real. It interrogates the crucial questions these thinkers have raised and concludes with a look toward the future of speculative realism, especially as it relates to the reality of time.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 291 pages\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Academic (September 25, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441174753\nISBN-13: 978-1441174758\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5345ea443c4f4b344e7f4674fc5cbdf6344ef00","amp;dn":"Speculative+Realism%3A+Problems+and+Prospects+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5345ea443c4f4b344e7f4674fc5cbdf6344ef00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,52,94,164,67,196,244,179,68,231,244,103,79,197,203,223,99,68,239,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
