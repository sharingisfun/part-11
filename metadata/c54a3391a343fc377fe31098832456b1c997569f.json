ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spicoli over there, trying hard to unwrap a bologna sandwich. His eyes are still red-rimmed from the three bowls of dope he smoked after his morning surf. Stacy Hamilton doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look any different even though she finally lost her virginity last night. Linda Barrett, StacyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best bud, wants to hear all about it. After all, she gives lessons. And here comes Brad Hamilton, king of the lunch court and prince of the fast-food employee hierarchy. BradÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a guy who takes pride in his fries. Mike Damone takes pride in The Attitude, which he developed in Philly, his hometown, where Ã¢â‚¬Å“life is cheap.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that wussy Mark Ratner. Girls make him sweat. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do more than sweat when he turns up in the yearbook class picture with something missing.\n\nThese kids are, uh, the future of America. Cameron Crowe spent a year with them at Ridgemont High in Anytown, California, and if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine or canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember (last week? last year? last decade?) what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to have acne, bio lab, Saturday night car cruises, and the embarrassment of parents, Fast Times at Ridgemont High will bring it all home for you. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tense, traumatic and marginally insaneÃ¢â‚¬â€and just like high school, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poignant, entertaining and totally true.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54a3391a343fc377fe31098832456b1c997569f","amp;dn":"Fast+Times+at+Ridgemont+High+-+Cameron+Crowe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54a3391a343fc377fe31098832456b1c997569f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,74,51,145,163,67,252,55,127,227,16,152,131,36,86,177,201,151,86,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
