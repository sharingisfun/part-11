I must confess that I thought \n\n\nthe whole concept too &quot;commercial&quot; at first.... but this really deserves a good \n\n\nlisten.....it's no more dubious than jazz albums with strings.  \n\n\nOn these later albums Bill Evans used Fender RHODES electric piano quite often.\n\n\nBesides Toots' harmonica, Larry Schneider plays saxes and flute to complete the \n\n\nquintet on some tracks.\n\n\nMy goal is to not bore you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c583a61c87660719a1fc1e29561e37449e4d7d16","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans%3A+Affinity+1979+w%2FToots+Thielemans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c583a61c87660719a1fc1e29561e37449e4d7d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,131,166,28,135,102,7,25,161,252,30,41,86,30,55,68,158,77,125,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
