These murder, suicide, and accident victims, separated from their names, are being adopted by the bizarre online world of amateur sleuths.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DIY CSI.\n\nThe web sleuths pore over facial reconstructions (a sort of Facebook for the dead) and other online clues as they vie to solve cold cases and tally up personal scorecards of dead bodies. The Skeleton Crew delves into the macabre underside of the Internet, the fleeting nature of identity, and how even the most ordinary citizen with a laptop and a knack for puzzles can reinvent herself as a web sleuth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ee1b3aa773c5927bdd161ef0e08fcfd87a1712","amp;dn":"The+Skeleton+Crew-+Deborah+Halber+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ee1b3aa773c5927bdd161ef0e08fcfd87a1712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,238,27,58,167,115,197,146,123,221,22,30,240,224,143,207,216,122,23,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
