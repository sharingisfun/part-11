Using more than 500 graphs and illustrations, the authors show how to design, estimate, and test an array of models.\n\nRequiring little prior knowledge of mathematics, the book focuses on classical forms and attractors as well as new simulation methods and techniques. Ideas clearly progress from the most elementary to the most advanced. The authors cover deterministic, stochastic, logistic, Gaussian, delay, Henon, Holmes, Lorenz, Rossler, and rotation models. They also look at chaotic analysis as a tool to design forms that appear in physical systems; simulate complicated and chaotic orbits and paths in the solar system; explore the HenonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heiles, Contopoulos, and Hamiltonian systems; and provide a compilation of interesting systems and variations of systems, including the very intriguing LotkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Volterra system.\n\nMaking a complex topic accessible through a visual and geometric style, this book should inspire new developments in the field of chaotic models and encourage more readers to become involved in this rapidly advancing area.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c657781c02e439695788156ea46e78efa3369a89","amp;dn":"Chaotic+Modelling+and+Simulation+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c657781c02e439695788156ea46e78efa3369a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,87,120,28,2,228,57,105,87,136,21,110,164,110,120,239,163,54,154,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
