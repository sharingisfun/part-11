But letâ€™s be honest: hedging has never inspired anyone.\r\n \r\nSo what if we stopped hedging? What if we grounded our efforts to solve environmental problems in hope instead, and let nature make our case for us? Thatâ€™s what George Monbiot does in Feral, a lyrical, unabashedly romantic vision of how, by inviting nature back into our lives, we can simultaneously cure our â€œecological boredomâ€ and begin repairing centuries of environmental damage. Monbiot takes readers on an enchanting journey around the world to explore ecosystems that have been â€œrewildedâ€: freed from human intervention and allowedâ€”in some cases for the first time in millenniaâ€”to resume their natural ecological processes. We share his awe, and wonder, as he kayaks among dolphins and seabirds off the coast of Wales and wanders the forests of Eastern Europe, where lynx and wolf packs are reclaiming their ancient hunting grounds. Through his eyes, we see environmental successâ€”and begin to envision a future world where humans and nature are no longer separate and antagonistic, but are together part of a single, healing world.\r\n \r\nMonbiotâ€™s commitment is fierce, his passion infectious, his writing compelling. Readers willing to leave the confines of civilization and join him on his bewitching journey will emerge changedâ€”and ready to change our world for the better","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c658b3268e79b6c6cdeb3ece0e288863d914f657","amp;dn":"Feral+-+Rewilding+the+Land%2C+the+Sea+and+Human+Life+%282014%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c658b3268e79b6c6cdeb3ece0e288863d914f657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,88,179,38,142,121,182,198,205,235,62,206,14,40,136,99,217,20,246,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
