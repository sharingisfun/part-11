The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang, Seung-up, and the historical background of his time. He was an orphan, but in his teens, he was picked up by a noble man, called, Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr.Kim becomes a mentor of Jang as well as life-long friendship, and continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place. With Jang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country, Korea falls down.\n\nJang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated, and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep inside of Jang's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life. He is very serious sometimes, but all of sudden, he changes to a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic, and sleeps with courtesans anytime. Even, he said in the movie, &quot;without an alcohol and a woman, I can't draw. (An alcohol and women are my only inspirations)&quot; In the peak of the fame, to develope his own style, he travels all around the country, and never gives up his pride as an artist for the authority or money. I don't want to give out every details, but I think you surely did get some ideas about the film.\n\n\n\nIMDB link:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317234/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69506b99a5da0e66c40b49571df2260f0d71c7e","amp;dn":"Chihwaseon.+2002.+Korean+Masterpiece.+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69506b99a5da0e66c40b49571df2260f0d71c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,149,6,185,154,93,160,230,108,64,180,149,113,223,34,96,240,215,28,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
