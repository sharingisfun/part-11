But Dvorak's death in 1904 inspired him to the greatest creative effort of his life -- an intensely emotional, richly elaborated memorial symphony, lasting an hour and named &quot;Asrael&quot; for the Islamic angel of death. The emotional content of the work became intensified during its composition when Suk's wife (Dvorak's daughter), Otylka, died when she was only 27, and &quot;Asrael&quot; became an elegy for father and daughter. The full power of this work is felt in a new recording (Virgin 7-91221-2) by Libor Pesek and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.&quot; --Joseph McLellan\r\n\r\nPart One\r\n1. I.
