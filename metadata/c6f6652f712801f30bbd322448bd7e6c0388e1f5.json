Based on the god of the same name from Norse mythology, the character was created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller Jack Kirby, and first appears in Journey into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962).\n\nThats enough for the introduction. I wanted to do this for a long time as I had already posted Thor Vol 1 and also intial Journey into Mystery issues. This post contains complete run of Thor v2 along with all the annauls. Thor v2 contians issues 1 to 85 which are also renumbered from the end of Vol 1 i.e as 503 to 587. It also contains the story arcs of Thor Lord of Asgard, Reigning and Ragnorak in the end. Enjoy and Seed.
