Bullying has morphed into the leftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s go-to tactic, as they attempt to quash their opponents through fear, threat of force, violence, and rhetorical intimidation on every major issue facing America today.\n\nBen Shapiro uncovers the simple strategy used by liberals and their friends in the media: bully the living hell out of conservatives. Play the race card, the class card, the sexism card. Use any and every means at your disposal to demonize your oppositionÃ¢â‚¬â€to shut them up. Then pretend that such bullying is justified, because, after all, conservatives are the true bullies, and need to be taught a lesson for their intolerance. Hidden beneath the leftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed hatred of bullying lies a passionate love of its vulgar tactics.\n\nThe left has created a climate of fear wherein ordinary Americans must abandon their principles, back abhorrent causes, and remain silent. They believe America is a force for evil, that our military is composed of war criminals, and that patriotism is the deepest form of treason. They incite riots and threaten violence by playing the race card, then claim theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re advocates for tolerance. Disagree with Obama? You must be a racist. They send out union thugs and Occupy Wall Street anarchists to destroy businesses and redistribute the wealth of earners and job creators. No target is off limits as liberal feminists declare war against stay-at-home moms, and gay activists out their enemies, destroy careers, and desecrate personal privacy.\n\nThese are the most despicable people in America, bullying their opponents while claiming to be the victims. Shapiro takes on the leftist bullies, exposes their hypocrisy, and offers conservatives a reality check in the face of what has become the gravest threat to American liberty: the leftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single-minded focus on ending political debate through bully tactics.\n\n&quot;Ben Shapiro is a warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never known him to back down from a fight and, in Bullies, he shows us all exactly why that fight is necessary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Glenn Beck, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Cowards )\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ben Shapiro has a great new book out called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bullies: How the LeftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premise about the leftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s silencing tactics is absolutely correct.
