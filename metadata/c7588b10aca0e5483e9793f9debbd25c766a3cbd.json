Rose! Over here, Rose! The Inception RiffTrax is out!\n\nThis is the 2010 film Inception, with RiffTrax commentary.\n\nVideo: H.264, 960x400, 23.976 fps, 1000 kbps\nAudio: OGG/Vorbis, 2 ch, 48 kHz, 160 kbps\nTrack 1: Film with RiffTrax commentary\nTrack 2: Just the film\nSubtitles: English\nRuntime: 02:28:07\n\nProcess: The video was re-encoded from a 720p BluRay rip of the film. The\nRiffTrax commentary is sync'd up with the film's audio and then all\nDisembAudio sync lines are silenced. The film audio is run through\ncompressor and autoduck filters to make the commentary most prominent but\nkeeping the movie audible when the riffers are not talking. This provides,\nit seems, the best riff-watching experience.\n\nPlease donate atif you have not purchased this commentary.\nThey make it very easy and are pleasantly understanding about the nature\nof the Internet. Better yet, purchase this commentary on their website\n(even if you don't download it) so they know which riffs are the most\npopular!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7588b10aca0e5483e9793f9debbd25c766a3cbd","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Inception+%28Dual+Audio%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7588b10aca0e5483e9793f9debbd25c766a3cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,88,139,16,172,160,229,72,62,151,147,249,222,187,210,92,118,106,60,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
