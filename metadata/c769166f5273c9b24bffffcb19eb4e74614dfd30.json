Cut in 1963 at the New Era Club in Nashville, the set finds Etta James in stellar shape as she forcefully delivers her own &quot;Something's Got a Hold on Me&quot; and &quot;Seven Day Fool&quot; interspersed with a diet of sizzling covers (&quot;What'd I Say,&quot; &quot;Sweet Little Angel,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; &quot;Ooh Poo Pah Doo&quot;). \nThe CD incarnation adds three more great titles, including an impassioned reprise of her &quot;All I Could Do Is Cry.&quot; Guitarist David T. Walker is outstanding whenever he solos.(AMG)\n\n\n\n\nSearing stuff -- easily one of Etta James' greatest albums! The set is a non-stop jam, recorded live at the New Era Club in Nashville before a small and screaming crowd -- a perfect performance all the way through, one that showcases Etta as she rarely sounded on vinyl during the 1960s. The whole album runs away like a train on fire, and it's filled with incredibly lively readings of tracks like &quot;Something's Got A Hold On Me&quot;, &quot;Baby What You Want Me To Do&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Seven Day Fool&quot;, and &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; -- all taken at versions longer than the usual under-3 minute single takes!\nThough the studio albums Etta James made for Chess in the 1960s usually had the blues singer surrounded by lush production and string-heavy arrangements, this live date finds her performing with only a rhythm section, organist, guitarist, and tenor saxophonist. The singer seems to respond to both the stripped-down setting and the enthusiastic audience with noticeable abandon. In fact, James the classy balladeer, a role she sometimes plays on her studio albums, is nowhere to be found on this blazing set. The only time the band slows down is on the tearjerker story-song &quot;All I Could Do Is Cry&quot; (though what the tune lacks in tempo it makes up for in emotional intensity).\nThe rest of the set is straight-edged blues and R&amp;B, including covers of some hits of the day, like &quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot; and Ray Charles's &quot;What'd I Say.&quot; Jimmy Reed's &quot;Baby What You Want Me To Do&quot; (on which James does a growling, harmonica-imitating vocal solo) steps up the blues quotient, as does the band's finale of Willie Dixon's &quot;I Just Want To Make Love to You,&quot; with James's gospel-drenched pipes wailing all the while. ETTA JAMES ROCKS THE HOUSE indeed.\n\n\n\n\n01. Something's Got A Hold On Me \n02. Baby What You Want Me To Do \n03. What'd I Say \n04. Money (That's What I Want) \n05. Seven Day Fool \n06.
