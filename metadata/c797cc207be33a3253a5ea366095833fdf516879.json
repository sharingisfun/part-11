Narrated by Golden Globe nominee Christopher Plummer (Best Supporting Actor, AMERICAN TRAGEDY, 2000), it is the bold and powerful story of Jesus as told by his disciple John. The best-loved but least understood of the gospels, John presents a uniquely human portrait of courage and passion encompassing Jesus&amp;#039; entire three-year ministry, the final years of his life. Intimate and reflective, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN offers an unparalleled opportunity to experience the incomparable life and times of Jesus Christ.\n\nCTCA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c797cc207be33a3253a5ea366095833fdf516879","amp;dn":"Gospel+of+John+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c797cc207be33a3253a5ea366095833fdf516879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,151,204,32,123,227,58,50,83,165,234,54,96,149,131,63,223,81,104,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
