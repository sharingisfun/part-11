Each of the singers is featured on four songs apiece while backed by such top players as clarinetist Buster Bailey, trombonist J.C. Higginbottham, and Cliff Jackson or Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith on piano. Hunter is in superior form on such numbers as &quot;You Gotta Reap Just What You Sow&quot; and &quot;I Got a Mind to Ramble,&quot; although she would soon be out of music for another 15 years, continuing her work as a nurse. Hegamin (who had not recorded since 1932) was having a brief last hurrah, despite sounding good, and Spivey, reviving her &quot;Black Snake Blues,&quot; would soon be launching her own Spivey label. This is a historic and enjoyable set recommended to both classic jazz and blues collectors.
