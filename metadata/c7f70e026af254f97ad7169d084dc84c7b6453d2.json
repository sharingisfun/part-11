One of the few 1980 shows that has no moments of \r\napathy or sluggishness. Fresh ideas and old ones are mixed and the result \r\nis one of the best concerts ever in Led Zeppelin's career. Achilles Last \r\nStand is excellent and one of the strongest versions ever and the encores \r\nare simply amazing. Robert's voice is great ... he hits all the high notes. \r\nJimmy tried calm down the audience while his playing in White Summer \r\n'cause he didn't hear himself! What makes this recording more interesting is \r\npresentation of Phil Carson, who joined the band for Money. He was \r\nintroduced as &quot;the man who used to play bass for Dusty Springfield&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f70e026af254f97ad7169d084dc84c7b6453d2","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.06.30+Frankfurt%2C+Germany+%28Remaster%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f70e026af254f97ad7169d084dc84c7b6453d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,247,14,2,106,242,84,249,122,215,22,157,8,77,200,76,123,100,83,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
