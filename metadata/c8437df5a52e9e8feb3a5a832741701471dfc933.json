Between 1951 and 1952 ten locomotives were built at Crewe and another 15 were planned for construction.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬ËœClanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Class was based on the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBritanniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Class, but employed a smaller boiler and used various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability for the locomotive's intended area of operations in the west of Scotland. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœClanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Class locomotives took their names from a previous locomotive class that was being withdrawn from service at the time and reinforced their intended running location.\n\nNumbers 72000 to 72004 were based solely at Glasgow Polmadie shed (66A) with loco's 72005 to 72009 based at the Carlisle Kingmoor shed.\n\nThe Just Trains 'Clan Class' collection is probably the most authentic and realistic steam locomotive add-on available to date and comes with a unique switcher tool to allow a Simple version to be driven. The loco's are available to drive in a set of liveries and with different cabs depending on the era depicted. Also included is a set of Just Trains Mk1 coaches with passenger view and leaking steam heating effect.    \n\nThis collection includes 15 exciting custom Standard scenarios and two Free Roams, including some that require additional routes, to provide an approximate total scenario duration time of over 20 hours!\nClan Pacific 'Hengist'\n\nJust Trains are proud to be working in association with The Ã¢â‚¬ËœClanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Project to create this Clan Class expansion and in particular the 72010 Ã¢â‚¬ËœHengistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ version. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœClanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Project are creating a new real-world build of a Clan locomotive which will bear the name Hengist. You can find out more by visiting them at the 'Clan' Project website.  \nThis collection includes the new-build 'Hengist' loco, with oval buffers, tablet catcher brackets removed from the cab side, operational air braking installed and the footplate access doors fitted to the included BR1B tender and not the locomotive. It is displayed in pristine condition and is equipped with AWS and speedometer. The distinctive sound of the Westinghouse air pump can be heard and we have included a set of configurable Southern region headcode discs and the Hengist rear damper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8437df5a52e9e8feb3a5a832741701471dfc933","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+Just+Trains+BR+Clan+Advanced+%26amp%3B+Mk.1+Coaches","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8437df5a52e9e8feb3a5a832741701471dfc933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,67,125,245,165,46,158,143,235,58,90,131,39,65,112,20,113,223,201,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
