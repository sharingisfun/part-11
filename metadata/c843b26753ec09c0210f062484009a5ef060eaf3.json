Led by Will EvansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rich, soulful vocals the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrangements incorporate catchy hooks and dynamic tempo shifts while giving the music room to breathe. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoll If You FallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe OceanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ get the crowd on its feet with infectious sing-along choruses and headlong momentum, and mid-tempo gems ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMisledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDrink to YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ carry an emotional weight that adds to their impact. The band reveals its range with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChanges in the Weather,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a pair of moving ballads featuring swelling strings that intertwine with the melodies. Sax and trumpet add grit and texture to the piano showcase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHesitationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the reggae-inflected ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEagle Front,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is solid roots rock buoyed by Weissenborn slide and bluesy harmonica bends. The song here that perhaps best illustrates Barefoot TruthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diversity is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSolitude.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Starting with a searing guitar riff that digs in and holds on, the band lays down a bedrock of thick organ, dexterous drumming, and an agile bass line before leading to a fiery harmonica solo and some jazz-tinged keyboards.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
