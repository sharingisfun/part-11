In a series of brilliantly interlinked chapters he shows how an Afghani wedding party  and a gas station proprietor in Texas  and a planespotter in Mallorca have been affected, sometimes devastatingly, by the American response to the attacks on the Twin Towers. Streatfeild shows how the sleep of reason and good sense in successive US administrations post-9/11 has brought forth the monsters of extraordinary rendition, Guantanamo Bay, extrajudicial execution and wholesale contravention of international law. This is a work that informs as it entertains and induces outrage as it inspires.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a39627b5e74843489f7d9df5a9622f3e1c96cf","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+World+Since+9%2F11+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a39627b5e74843489f7d9df5a9622f3e1c96cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,163,150,39,181,231,72,67,72,159,125,157,245,169,98,47,62,28,150,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
