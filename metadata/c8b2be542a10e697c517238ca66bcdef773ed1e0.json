Keith rarely devastates as a singer, but he never overreaches, and there&amp;#039;s more than a bit of grit in his delivery of &quot;Should&amp;#039;ve Been a Cowboy&quot; and &quot;He Ain&amp;#039;t Worth Missing.&quot; His emotional triumph remains the obsessive &quot;Who&amp;#039;s That Man,&quot; in which Keith sees another man living the life he threw away. Keith also includes two songs not available elsewhere, complementing an appealing mainstream country set.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    Toby Keith\n? Title:     Greatest Hits Vol. 1\n?
