Although he is primarily remembered as a country music icon, his songs and sound spanned many other genres including rockabilly and rock and roll-especially early in his careerÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal led to Cash being inducted in the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n\nCash was known for his deep, distinctive bass-baritone voice; for the &quot;boom-chicka-boom&quot; sound of his Tennessee Three backing band; for his rebelliousness, coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor; for providing free concerts inside prison walls; and for his dark performance clothing, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Man in Black&quot;. He traditionally started his concerts by saying &quot;Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.&quot; and usually following it up with his standard &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.\n\nAn abundance of Cash's music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption. His signature songs include &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;Get Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Man in Black&quot;. He also recorded humorous numbers, including &quot;One Piece at a Time&quot; and &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called &quot;Jackson&quot;; as well as railroad songs including &quot;Hey, Porter&quot; and &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;.Late in his career, Cash covered songs by several rock artists, most notably &quot;Hurt&quot; by Nine Inch Nails.
