The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer).\nDespite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, the ambient sound of their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album influenced the same dance-oriented sound of their third album Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles,and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards.\nTheir fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and Paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synthpop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp are scheduled to release their sixth studio album, Tales of Us, in September of 2013.\n\n\nimage Review:\nGoldfrapp began recording their sixth studio album in April 2011. Recording took place in the English countryside, while the album was mixed in London.\nThe band announced the title of their upcoming album on 11 June 2013. All the song titles, with the exception of &quot;Stranger&quot;, are of singular names. Accompanying this announcement was the re-launch of the duo's website which features a trailer video directed by Lisa Gunning. Goldfrapp performed songs from Tales of Us at the Manchester International Festival in July 2013. The first single from the album is &quot;Drew&quot;. Lauren Laverne premiered a radio edit of the track, on her BBC Radio 6 show on 15 July 2013. Shortly afterwards the video featuring the full length track was uploaded onto the band's website. &quot;Drew&quot; is due for release on 2nd September 2013.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;Jo&quot; 4:38\n2. &quot;Annabel&quot; 4:01\n3. &quot;Drew&quot; 4:46\n4. &quot;Ulla&quot; 3:49\n5. &quot;Alvar&quot; 5:38\n6. &quot;Thea&quot; 4:50\n7. &quot;Simone&quot; 4:18\n8. &quot;Stranger&quot; 4:12\n9. &quot;Laurel&quot; 4:10\n10. &quot;Clay&quot; 4:20\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry:England\nGenre: Electronic\nStyles: Folktronica, dream pop, ambient, synthpop\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8ebcebbe65c3209293ee5dd081d6e10208e9583","amp;dn":"%282013%29+Goldfrapp+-+Tales+Of+Us+%40320+kbps+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8ebcebbe65c3209293ee5dd081d6e10208e9583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,235,206,187,230,92,50,9,41,62,229,221,8,29,110,16,32,142,149,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
