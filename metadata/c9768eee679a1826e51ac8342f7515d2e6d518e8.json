These groundbreaking advances have opened infinite fields of investigation into such areas as musical perception, brain development in utero, and faulty brain connections leading to psychiatric disorders and have raised unprecedented ethical issues. In Looking Inside the Brain, one of the leading pioneers of the field, Denis Le Bihan, offers an engaging account of the sophisticated interdisciplinary research in physics, neuroscience, and medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9768eee679a1826e51ac8342f7515d2e6d518e8","amp;dn":"Looking+Inside+the+Brain%3A+The+Power+of+Neuroimaging+%282014%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9768eee679a1826e51ac8342f7515d2e6d518e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,118,142,238,103,154,24,38,229,26,200,52,47,117,21,210,230,213,24,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
