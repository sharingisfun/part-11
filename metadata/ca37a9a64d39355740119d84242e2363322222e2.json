Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn&amp;#039;t exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.\n\nTo save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:\n\nSongs and Dances of the Middle Ages (Sonus)\nGregorian Chants, Eternal Chants (The Benedictine Monks of the Abbey at Ganagobie)\nMedieval English Music (Hilliard Ensemble)\nThys Yool- A Medieval Christmas (Martin Best Medieval Ensemble)\n\nBe certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca37a9a64d39355740119d84242e2363322222e2","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca37a9a64d39355740119d84242e2363322222e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,55,169,166,77,57,53,87,64,17,157,132,36,46,35,99,50,34,34,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
