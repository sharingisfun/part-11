As the nation faces the possibility of a loss with the Japanese military charging fearlessly to the capital of the nation, Admiral YI is reappointed as the Chief of Naval Operations and assembles a group of soldiers to defend the nation against Japanese attack. Japanese Chief Commander Kurushima (RYU Seung-ryong), notorious for his cruel personality and clever strategies, responds by destroying Joseon's one last hope, the Turtle Ship. With just 12 battleships and an army of doubtful soldiers, Admiral YI and his soldiers face 330 Japanese battleships in The Battle of Myeong-Nyang.\n\nDirector: Han Min Kim\n\nWriters: Han Min Kim, Chul Hong Jun\n\nActors: Min Sik Choi, Seung Ryong Ryu, Jin Woong Cho, Gu Jin, Jung Hyun Lee, Myung Gon Kim\n\nGenre: Foreign, Action and Adventure, Drama\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 7 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca73d0416225e14581a911c8afb4f94867d291fa","amp;dn":"The+Admiral%3A+Roaring+Currents.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca73d0416225e14581a911c8afb4f94867d291fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,115,208,65,98,37,225,69,129,169,17,200,175,180,249,72,103,210,145,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
