It was originally devised as a double-LP set to accompany a film project, but when plans for the movie were scuttled, the band salvaged parts of its potential score as a ten-song, single-LP album. Other tracks were drawn from writing sessions for a never-released follow-up to 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Thick as a Brick; another song dated as far back as the sessions for 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Aqualung.\n\nThis new edition of WarChild is dubbed the 40th Anniversary Theatre Edition and includes on a second CD many orchestral pieces written for the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soundtrack, most of which are unissued until now. Alongside the orchestral pieces on the second disc set some Ã¢â‚¬Ëœassociated recordingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from the original sessions.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa9ba4ac44b089c7ae14f9181b6e62a480141cf","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+War+Child+%5BThe+40th+Anniversary+Edition%5D+%282014%29+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa9ba4ac44b089c7ae14f9181b6e62a480141cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,169,186,74,196,75,8,156,122,225,79,145,129,182,230,42,72,1,65,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
