Villagers are convinced the wrong boy lived. Sure enough, Ned grows up weak and slow, and stays as much as possible within the safe boundaries of his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cottage and yard. But when a Bandit King comes to steal the magic that NedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, a witch, is meant to protect, it's Ned who safeguards the magic and summons the strength to protect his family and community.\n\nIn the meantime, in another kingdom across the forest that borders NedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s village lives Ãƒï¿½ine, the resourceful and pragmatic daughter of the Bandit King. She is haunted by her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last words to her: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The wrong boy will save your life and you will save his.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But when Ãƒï¿½ine and NedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paths cross, can they trust each other long enough to make their way through the treacherous woods and stop the war about to boil over?\n\nWith a deft hand, acclaimed author Kelly Barnhill takes classic fairy tale elements--speaking stones, a friendly wolf, and a spoiled young king--and weaves them into a richly detailed narrative that explores good and evil, love and hate, magic, and the power of friendship.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab0eb239403c4d42a333db3fbe4f6fde249f363","amp;dn":"The+Witch%27s+Boy+by+Kelly+Barnhill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab0eb239403c4d42a333db3fbe4f6fde249f363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,176,235,35,148,3,196,212,42,51,61,179,251,228,246,253,226,73,243,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
