This can mostly likely be put down to some wonderful developers such as DID, Jane's and Microprose which created PC games so realistic that they were picked up by Air Forces around the world and used to train pilots. Unfortunately, consoles gamers have usually received less simulator and more arcade styled flight sims resulting in less then stellar overall sales, and a perception of poor games. Namco's Ace Combat 4: Distant Thunder looks set to shake this trend with some stunning visuals and enough grunt from the Playstation 2 to create a realistic physics and flight engine. \n\nComplete review: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.futuregamez.net/ps2games/acombat4/review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.futuregamez.net/ps2games/acombat4/review.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamereactor.no/bilde/?productid=2797&amp;sid=79baf21ce7a46e1248d286af5a5ac00f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamereactor.no/bilde/?productid=2797&amp;sid=79baf21ce7a46e1248d286af5a5ac00f&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFiles saved with Nero Burning-room 8.0 .iso.\n\nIncludes Disc and Cover art.\n\nPlease help seeding after download, low upload speed :-).
