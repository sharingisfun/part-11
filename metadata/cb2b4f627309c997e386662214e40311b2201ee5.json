As voted for by the community, the\r\nversatile Israeli army and its extensive use of modified foreign\r\nequipment joins the fray with 96 new units to add further depth to Eugen\r\nSystems' spectacular RTS.\r\nIsrael is playable as a stand-alone nation, bringing a wide array of\r\nweapons and vehicles that make Tzahal able to stand against any of the\r\nmost-played decks. In addition to the legendary Merkava tank family, one\r\nof many of Israel's indigenous designs, the army also features heavily\r\nmodified import units. These include British Centurion, American M60s,\r\nFrench Mirages III &amp; V, as well as Soviet T-55 and PT-76 - salvaged from\r\nprevious wars.\r\nState-of-the-art weaponry connoisseurs will enjoy the Makmat, a huge\r\nself-propelled heavy 160mm mortar mounted on a World War 2 Sherman tank;\r\nthe monstrous Multiple Launch Rocket System MAR-290 is on Centurion\r\nchassis; or the Sholef, proudly mounting a Finnish gun on a heavily\r\narmored Merkava chassis.\r\nTruly versatile, Tzahal leans on its complete infantry roster and\r\neffective anti-tank guided missile designs to scout and deal damage from\r\nlong range. They are able to strike with extreme precision, thanks to\r\nthe Spike, MAPATS and LAHAT units as well as the renowned Nimrod missile.\r\nTzahal also makes use of aircrafts, such as the Lahatut and Tzefa\r\nhelicopters, to support their ground assaults.\r\nNOTE:\r\nGame is made standalone, fully updated and featuring all to date released\r\nDLC+Expansions.\r\n\r\nEdit steam_api.ini for changing language to other than english or use\r\nLauncher.exe, which are included with the crack!\r\n\r\nBurn/mount, install, copy crack, play!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2b4f627309c997e386662214e40311b2201ee5","amp;dn":"Wargame.Red.Dragon.Nation.Pack.Israel-TiNYiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2b4f627309c997e386662214e40311b2201ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,43,79,98,115,9,201,151,227,134,102,34,20,228,3,17,178,32,30,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
