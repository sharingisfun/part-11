ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clearly a revival of a certain type of folk; one imbued with the \n\ndeep green hues of an imagined Sherwood forest and with more than a hint of \n\nthe madrigal and ancient English and Celtic traditions.\n\nAll of which are filtered through the singer/songwriter sensibilities of Crosby, \n\nStills &amp; Nash and the soft-focus mystery dramas of the Moody Blues.\n\nOddly, most of these groups come from America, a country with its own folk \n\ntraditions, but in the case of the Smoke Fairies, these maidens are English \n\nthrough-and-through, but flecked with a few influences picked up on touring \n\ntravels through the United States.\n\nThis duo has it all down pat: a fruity harmonizing thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s has more than a \n\ntouch of LA singer-songwriter about it, but also something of EnyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ethereal \n\nwordless vocals; an influence that may be unintentional, but would have been \n\nunthinkable a decade ago.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a stripped-back, almost rural back-porch, bluesy aspect on a few \n\ntracks (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Strange Moon RisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ being a good example) and the totality hangs \n\ntogether beautifully.\n\nThe spare production works a dream, with guitar and bass textures caught well \n\nand the cymbals deliciously crisp.\n\nThe songs seem to be mostly about fleeting unions and partings, and they find \n\na way to breathe poetry into what amounts to young lust.\n\nDownbeat, elegaiac and often downright gorgeous, Through The Low Light &amp; \n\nTrees, like MidlakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Courage Of Others, is easy to unleash oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \n\ncynicism on. On this occasion, I would prefer to give in and submit to the \n\ncharm. \n\ncd ripped by  dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/smoke-fairies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/smoke-fairies/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6a08672a4fcc0a45378e1ce27dcd0906b3e014","amp;dn":"Smoke+Fairies...Through+Low+Light+and+Trees%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb6a08672a4fcc0a45378e1ce27dcd0906b3e014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,106,8,103,42,79,204,10,69,55,142,28,226,125,205,9,6,179,224,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
