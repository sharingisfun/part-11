He was at the forefront of the jazz world for decades and was involved in the evolution of bebop, cool jazz, modal jazz and jazz fusion amongst others. Miles Davis played many times at the Montreux Jazz Festival, especially after his return to performance in the early eighties. This DVD brings together some of the highlights of those Montreux shows stretching back to his first appearance in 1973 and up to his final concert there in July 1991, just a couple of months before his death in September of that year. Bonus Features: An insightful and personal interview with Carlos Santana talking about his memories of and relationship with Miles Davis and how he was influenced by him.\n\nThis musical release from legendary jazz trumpeter Miles Davis captures key performances by artist, recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival between 1973 and in 1991.
