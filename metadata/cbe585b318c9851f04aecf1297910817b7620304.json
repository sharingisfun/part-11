This volume lasted 15 years without interruption - and saw such luminaries as Chris Claremont and the underrated Larry Hama handle writing duties, while greats such as John Buscema, Marc Silverstri and Adam Kubert turns at the excellent artwork.\n\nThis torrent is all HQ scans of the entire run, thanks to DarthMedio+Novus+DCP. Other scanners included are Mediozo, Proliozo, and Minutemen-Morningstar+Syl3ntBob. This is the all noads versions of the issues; the files were previously collected along with the c2c versions by blackcanary - much thanks to him for that. All the scanners here do great work and deserve serious appreciation for how good this all looks. There are several assorted extras - all the annuals for this era, the -1 &quot;Flashback&quot; issue, The Night Man vs. Wolverine (Malibu/Marvel crossover), and three Wizard Magazine specials - issue 1/2 (1996), Wolverine Tribute Edition (1996) and Wolverine vs. The World (1999). Those are also by Darthmedio-DCP and some Minutemen-Megascanner as well as Anon for the rest. MASSIVE thanks to all for their efforts, and please seed and enjoy...THE WOLVERINE! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbe585b318c9851f04aecf1297910817b7620304","amp;dn":"Wolverine+v2+01-189+%2B+Ex+%281988-2003%7Cnoads%7CDarthMedio%2BNovus%2BDCP%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbe585b318c9851f04aecf1297910817b7620304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,229,133,179,24,201,133,31,4,174,207,18,151,145,8,23,183,98,3,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
