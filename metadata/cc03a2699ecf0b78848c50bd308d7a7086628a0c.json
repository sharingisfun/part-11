The band revolves around the songwriting partnership of brothers Jim and William Reid. They released a string of albums, singles and EPs from their formation in 1984 until their breakup in 1999. In 2007 the band reunited and began work on a new album.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPsychocandy is the debut album by the Scottish alternative rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain, released in November 1985 . Psychocandy utilised the then-radical notion of combining simple pop tunes, ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  la The Beach Boys, with searing guitar noise more akin to The Velvet Underground.\n\nThe album is considered to be a landmark recording, frequently appearing in &quot;best-ever&quot; album lists, such as Q magazine's list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, where it placed at number 88 in 2000. In 2003, the album was ranked number 268 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Allmusic described the album as one that &quot;created a movement without meaning to.&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Jim and William Reid.\n\n   1. &quot;Just Like Honey&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:03\n   2. &quot;The Living End&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:16\n   3. &quot;Taste the Floor&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:56\n   4. &quot;The Hardest Walk&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:40\n   5. &quot;Cut Dead&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:47\n   6. &quot;In a Hole&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:02\n   7. &quot;Taste of Cindy&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 1:42\n   8. &quot;Some Candy Talking&quot;- 1:39\n   9. &quot;Never Understand&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:57\n  10. &quot;Inside Me&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:09\n  11. &quot;Sowing Seeds&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:50\n  12. &quot;My Little Underground&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:31\n  13. &quot;You Trip Me Up&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:26\n  14. &quot;Something's Wrong&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:01\n  15. &quot;It's So Hard&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:37\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDarklands is the second album by Scottish alternative band The Jesus and Mary Chain. Unlike their previous album, drum machines were used in place of drummer Bobby Gillespie, who had left to pursue a successful career as the frontman with Primal Scream. The album marks a turning point in the band's music, going from the savage noise-pop of Psychocandy, to a more melodic Indie/Alternative rock sound.\n\nGillespie and Primal Scream later recorded a cover of the album's title track.\n\nLead vocals are by Jim Reid, with the exception of &quot;Darklands,&quot; &quot;Nine Million Rainy Days&quot; and &quot;On the Wall,&quot; sung by William Reid.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Darklands&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:29\n   2. &quot;Deep One Perfect Morning&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:43\n   3. &quot;Happy When It Rains&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:36\n   4. &quot;Down on Me&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:36\n   5. &quot;Nine Million Rainy Days&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:29\n   6. &quot;April Skies&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:00\n   7. &quot;Fall&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:28\n   8. &quot;Cherry Came Too&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:06\n   9. &quot;On the Wall&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:05\n  10. &quot;About You&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this isn't seeded, I will let it die.
