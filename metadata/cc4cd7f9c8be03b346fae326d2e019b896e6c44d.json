His architecture, simple yet powerful, incorporates elements of his country's architectural identity - including the use of wood and carefully picked Modernist influences - bringing it at the same time into the 21st century with excellent execution, carefully chosen materials and a hands-on approach. Saunders (he lives and works in Bergen, Norway) has successfully executed work in both Canada, Norway, and Finland, creating architecture with a strong sense of northern identity, an individual approach that is informed by the strongness of natural landscape. The most important projects: Aurland Lookout, Long Studio, Fogo Island, Tower Studio, Fogo Island, Squish Studio, Fogo Island and Villa G. The first reference monograph on a remarkable young architect working in Scandinavia and Canada. The monograph provides interesting unpublished documents, curated by Jonathan Bell (Architecture Editor, Wallpaper* magazine) and Ellie Stathaki (Deputy Architecture Editor, Wallpaper* magazine) as well as three interviews by Olaf Gipser, Zita Cobb, and Brian MacKay-Lyons. The artwork of the book is by the international renowned graphic designer Henrik Nygren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4cd7f9c8be03b346fae326d2e019b896e6c44d","amp;dn":"Todd+Saunders+-+Architecture+in+Northern+Landscapes+%28Art+Ebook%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4cd7f9c8be03b346fae326d2e019b896e6c44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,76,215,249,200,190,3,179,70,250,227,38,210,224,25,184,150,230,196,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
