Formed from the ashes of the group Radio Blank, Dalek I Love You was founded in November 1977 by guitarist Alan Gill and bassist David Balfe; while Balfe wished to call the band the Daleks, Gill preferred Darling I Love You. Upon reaching a compromise, the duo recruited keyboardist Dave Hughes, synth player Chris &quot;Teepee&quot; Shaw and a drum machine, completing the first of many fluid line-ups.\n\nAfter issuing a handful of singles experimenting with electronic pop sounds, Balfe exited to join Big in Japan (later settling in the Teardrop Explodes), and by the release of their 1980 debut Compass Kum&amp;#039;pass, Dalek I Love You was already splintering: Hughes soon departed to join Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and before long Gill reunited with Balfe in the Teardrop Explodes. However, in 1983 a line-up of Dalek I Love You comprising none of the original members issued a self-titled LP on the Korova label; as simply Dalek I, they also released the cassette-only Naive in 1985 before finally calling it a day.\n\nTracklisting\n\n01 The World\n02 Eight Track\n03 Destiny (Dalek I Love You)\n04 A Suicide\n05 This Kiss\n06 Trapped\n07 Two Chameleons\n08 Freedom Fighters\n09 You Really Got Me\n10 Mad\n11 Good Times\n12 We&amp;#039;re All Actors\n13 Heat\n14 Missing 15 Minutes\n15 Astronauts (Have Landed On Moon)\n16 Happy\n17 This Is My Uniform\n18 Heartbeat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc96686826412da4f590697df260f085b63f6f89","amp;dn":"Dalek+I+-+Compass+%5Bkum-pas%5D+%5B%5BNew+Wave+1980%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc96686826412da4f590697df260f085b63f6f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,150,104,104,38,65,45,164,245,144,105,125,242,96,240,133,182,63,111,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
