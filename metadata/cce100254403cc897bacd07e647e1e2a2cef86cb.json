The strength of this volume lies in its breadth - it looks at archaeology, language, literature, towns, warfare, rural life, art, religion and myth, trade and industry, political organisations, society and technology. \n\nThe Celtic World draws together material from all over pagan Celtic Europe and includes contributions from British, European and American scholars. Much of the material is new research which is previously unpublished.\nThe book addresses some important issues - Who were the ancient Celts? Can we speak of them as the first Europeans? In what form does the Celtic identity exist today and how does this relate to the ancient Celts?\nFor anyone interested in the Celts, and for students and academics alike, The Celtic World will be a valuable resource and a fascinating read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce100254403cc897bacd07e647e1e2a2cef86cb","amp;dn":"The+Celtic+World+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce100254403cc897bacd07e647e1e2a2cef86cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,225,0,37,68,3,204,137,123,172,208,126,100,126,30,42,44,239,134,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
