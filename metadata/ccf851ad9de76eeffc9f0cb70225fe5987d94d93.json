In some cases, this absence can be dangerous, but in others it can simply mean a different way of seeing the world.\nIn The Science of Evil Simon Baron-Cohen, an award-winning British researcher who has investigated psychology and autism for decades, develops a new brain-based theory of human cruelty. A true psychologist, however, he examines social and environmental factors that can erode empathy, including neglect and abuse.\n\nBased largely on Baron-Cohen's own research, The Science of Evil will change the way we understand and treat human cruelty.\n\nHardcover: 256 pages \nPublisher: Basic Books (May 31, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf851ad9de76eeffc9f0cb70225fe5987d94d93","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Evil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf851ad9de76eeffc9f0cb70225fe5987d94d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,248,81,173,157,231,110,239,252,159,12,183,2,37,254,89,135,217,77,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
