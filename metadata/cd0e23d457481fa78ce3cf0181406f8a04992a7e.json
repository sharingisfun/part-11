It was aired on Feb 8, 2013 on HBO HD Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8. \n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Transporter.The.Series.S01E07.Give.the.Guy.a.Hand.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            367,153,152 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             47:20.815\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              891 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              130 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0e23d457481fa78ce3cf0181406f8a04992a7e","amp;dn":"Transporter+The+Series+S01E07+Give+the+Guy+a+Hand+WS.XviD-err000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0e23d457481fa78ce3cf0181406f8a04992a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,14,35,212,87,72,31,167,140,227,207,1,129,64,111,138,4,153,42,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
