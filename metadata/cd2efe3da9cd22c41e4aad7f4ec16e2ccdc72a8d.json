He was born in Cologne, then Imperial Germany, and educated in political science at the University of Vienna. He became a teacher and then an associate professor of political science at the Faculty of Law. In 1938 he, with his wife, fled from the Nazi forces which had recently entered Vienna, emigrating to the United States, where they became citizens in 1944. He spent most of his academic career at the University of Notre Dame, Louisiana State University, the University of Munich and the Hoover Institution of Stanford University.\n\nAfter fleeing Nazi Germany, Voegelin worked throughout his life to account for the endemic political violence of the twentieth century in an effort variously referred to as a philosophy of politics, history, or consciousness. In VoegelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex Weltanschauung, he &quot;blamed a flawed utopian interpretation of Christianity for spawning totalitarian movements like Nazism and Communism.&quot; He provided a &quot;philosophical framework that reconciled [the] Roman Catholic faith with [. . .] conservative politics.&quot;\n\nVoegelin published scores of books, essays, and reviews in his lifetime. An early work was Die politischen Religionen (1938), (The Political Religions), on totalitarian ideologies and their structural similarities to religion. His magnum opus is the multi-volume (English-language) Order and History, which began publication in 1956 and remained incomplete at the time of his death 29 years later. His 1951 Charles Walgreen lectures, published as The New Science of Politics, is generally seen as a prolegomenon to this, and remains his best known work. He left many manuscripts unpublished, including a history of political ideas that has since been published in eight volumes.\n\nOrder and History was originally conceived as a six-volume examination of the history of order occasioned by Voegelin's personal experience of the disorder of his time. The first three volumes, Israel and Revelation, The World of the Polis, and Plato and Aristotle, appeared in rapid succession in 1956 and 1957 and focused on the evocations of order in the ancient Near East and Greece.\n\nVoegelin then encountered difficulties that slowed the publication down. This, combined with his university administrative duties and work related to the new institute, meant that seventeen years separated the fourth from the third volume. His new concerns were indicated in the 1966 German collection Anamnesis: Zur Theorie der Geschichte und Politik, and the fourth volume, The Ecumenic Age, appeared in 1974. It broke with the chronological pattern of the previous volumes by investigating symbolizations of order ranging in time from the Sumerian King List to Hegel. Continuing work on the final volume, In Search of Order, occupied Voegelin's final days and it was published posthumously in 1987.\n\nVolume I: Israel and Revelation\n\nEric Voegelin's Israel and Revelation is the opening volume of his monumental Order and History, which traces the history of order in human society. This volume examines the ancient near eastern civilizations as a backdrop to a discussion of the historical locus of order in Israel. \n\nVolume II: The World of the Polis\n\nThis second volume of Voegelin's magisterial Order and History, The World of the Polis, explores the ancient Greek symbolization of human reality.\n\nVolume III: Plato and Aristotle\n\nThis third volume of Order and History completes Voegelin's study of Greek culture from its earliest pre- Hellenic origins to its full maturity with the dominance of Athens. As the title suggests, Plato and Aristotle is principally devoted to the work of the two great thinkers who represent the high point of philosophic inquiry among the Greeks.\n\nVolume IV: The Ecumenic Age\n\nIn the fourth volume, The Ecumenic Age, Voegelin breaks with the course he originally charted for the series, in which human existence in society and the corresponding symbolism of order were to be presented in historical succession. The Ecumenic Age treats history not as a stream of human beings and their actions in time, but as the process of man's participation in a flux of divine presence that has eschatological direction.\n\nVolume V: In Search of Order\n\nThis final volume of Order and History is devoted to the elucidation of the experience of transcendence that Voegelin discussed in earlier volumes.\n\n***I have more Voegelin, if there's any interest.***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2efe3da9cd22c41e4aad7f4ec16e2ccdc72a8d","amp;dn":"Eric+Voegelin+-+Order+and+History+%28Vols.+I-V%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2efe3da9cd22c41e4aad7f4ec16e2ccdc72a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,46,254,61,169,205,34,196,30,74,173,127,78,193,110,44,205,199,42,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
