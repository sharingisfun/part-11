Either IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m hallucinating, or I just watched a movie in which a computer-generated swamp-dragon defecates onto squealing Japanese women. \n\nInstant Swamp may also include water sprites that resemble sea-turtles filmed through a mescaline gel cap, and a robotic King Tut that predicts futures marriages. Directed by Adrift in TokyoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Satoshi Miki, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the story of Haname (Kumiko Aso) a young woman searching to end her run of bad luck by digging up some childhood toys she dumped in a now non-existent swamp. Along the way, she finds her biological father Light Bulb, a hippie antique dealer played by a Japanese George Carlin, and develops a friendship with a punk rock electrician named Gas. \n\nWhile it embraces the same sense of joyful aimlessness as Adrift in Tokyo (read my review here), Instant Swamp is a much livelier film, primarily because Haname is sort of supercharged Hello Kitty when it comes to cuteness. That said, the humour in the film is a touch scattershot, which does make the story seem more like a trifle than a strong narrative. But for a lighthearted comedy, or a possible schizophrenic episode on my part, Instant Swamp definitely does the trick.[/quote] \n\n***\n\n[quote]Satoshi Miki's comedy about an endearingly flaky woman's search for her eccentric antique (i.e., junk) dealer dad is packed with small comic gems, delivered in Miki's trademark dry style of spot-on timing and blithe disregard for logic.\n\nAfter being forced to resign from her publishing company job when her magazine goes out of circulation, office worker Haname Jinchoge (Kumiko Aso) is given the name of her real father-Noburo Jinchoge when her mother (Keiko Matsuzaka) falls into a coma after nearly drowning in a pond while searching for kappa. Unsure if Noburo (Morio Kazama) is her father, Haname decides to visit him but tells him that she is a distant relative, he happens to be the shopkeeper at an odd antiquities shop called Light Bulb Co., working for her father is a punk rocker named Gas (Ryo Kase).\n\nHaname becomes fascinated with the various oddities and charm of Light Bulb Co., and discovers that she, like her father has a knack for selling things so she decides to become a shopkeeper herself. Customers are hard to come by, but she listens to her dad's strange advice.....[/quote]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h40m53s180.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h40m53s180.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h41m03s126.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h41m03s126.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h41m12s215.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/vlcsnap-2010-02-19-00h41m12s215.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----my rip------\n\n~~~~~~ Insutanto numa.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,609,390,080                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:00:19                \n\nFrame Count:....................................173062             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................368                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.913                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1582                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.255&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
