Detailed descriptions and color photographs for over 100 species are provided, as well as an exploration of their long-standing (and often religious) use by ancient peoples and their continued significance to modern-day culture. Some of the species included have just been discovered in the past year or two, and still others have never before been photographed in their natural habitats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8076cf7736b9bbaacc7de3540b1cfb90b02d3f","amp;dn":"Psilocybin_Mushrooms_of_the_World_-_Paul_Stamets.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8076cf7736b9bbaacc7de3540b1cfb90b02d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,128,118,207,119,54,185,187,170,204,125,227,84,11,28,251,144,176,45,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
