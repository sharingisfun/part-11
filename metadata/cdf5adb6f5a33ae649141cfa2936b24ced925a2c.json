They are the Britons, Byzantines, Celts, Goths, Teutons, Franks, Mongols, Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Saracens, Turks and the Vikings. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and ultimately defeat their enemies. There are five historically-based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained.\n\nAge of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion (sometimes abbreviated to AoC or AoK: TC) is the expansion pack to the 1999 real-time strategy game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. The Conquerors is the fourth installment in the Age of Empires series by Microsoft Game Studios and Ensemble Studios. It features five new civilizations (the Aztecs, Mayans, Spanish, Koreans, and Huns), four new campaigns, eleven new units, twenty-six new technologies, new gameplay modes, new maps and different minor tweaks to the gameplay.\n\nMINIMUM PC REQUIREMENTS\nWindows 98/98/ME/NT4/2000 Professional)\n\nInstallation of Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings\n\n32MB RAM (Windows 95/98/ME)\n\n64MB RAM (Windows NT/2000)\n\n200MB Hard Disk Space (additional to original game)\n\n4X CD-ROM Drive\n\n2MB SVGA Video Card @ 256-colors\n\nMouse\n\nKeyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf5adb6f5a33ae649141cfa2936b24ced925a2c","amp;dn":"Age+Of+Empires+II+%282%29+plus+The+Conquerors+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf5adb6f5a33ae649141cfa2936b24ced925a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,245,173,182,245,163,58,230,73,20,28,250,41,54,178,76,237,146,90,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
