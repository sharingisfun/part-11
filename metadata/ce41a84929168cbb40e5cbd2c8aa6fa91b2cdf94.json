Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nLike much of Roth's fiction, this book confronts the tenuous \nrelationship between an author and his artistic creations. It resumes \nthe story of Roth's fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman that was \ninaugurated in Roth's previous novel The Ghost Writer.\n\nThe novel parallels several real events in Roth's life, including the \npublication of his 1969 novel Portnoy's Complaint and the hoopla which \nsurrounded Roth in the wake of that novel's fame. By analogy, in \nZuckerman Unbound, Zuckerman has achieved meteoric acclaim and notoriety \nwith &quot;Carnovsky&quot;, a coming-of-age sex romp that differs remarkably from \nZuckerman's previously Jamesian fiction. The extent to which the details \nof the Zuckerman character can be safely compared to those of Roth has \nbeen a subject of zealous debate among Roth's readers. Roth himself has \nweighed in on the debate, both in interviews and within his fiction.\n\n - - -\nFrom Recorded Books:\n\nPhilip Roth is one of the most acclaimed American authors of the 20th \ncentury. His Zuckerman novels, based on the &quot;fictional&quot; exploits of \nemotionally conflicted Jewish novelist, Nathan Zuckerman, are a splendid \nmix of comedy and tragedy. Zuckerman Unbound considers the problem of \nartistic triumph born of domestic upheaval. RothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prose finds an \nextraordinary complement with George GuidallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s robust narration.\n\n* A New York Times Best Book of the Year\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n&gt;&gt;Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce41a84929168cbb40e5cbd2c8aa6fa91b2cdf94","amp;dn":"ZUCKERMAN+UNBOUND+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce41a84929168cbb40e5cbd2c8aa6fa91b2cdf94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,65,168,73,41,22,140,187,64,229,203,210,200,170,111,169,27,44,223,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
