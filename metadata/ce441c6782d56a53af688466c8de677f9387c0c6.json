Of the original tracks, only four date from prior to the Exodus album.\n\nThe cassette tape release of the album featured two extra songs, &quot;Punky Reggae Party,&quot; the b-side to the &quot;Jamming&quot; single, and &quot;Easy Skanking&quot; from the Kaya album. A second generation compact disc remastered by Barry Diament appeared in 1990 on the Tuff Gong label. Although the disc includes the same 14 songs, the tracks are in their original album lengths rather than the edited versions for single release.\n\nOn February 12, 2002, the expanded 14-track edition with songs at album lengths were remastered for compact disc with a bonus disc consisting of 1984-vintage remixes for extended dance club singles and dub versions. In 2004, the Legend double-disc deluxe edition was reissued with the music DVD of the same name in the sound + vision deluxe edition. In 2010, Legend was made available as downloadable content for Rock Band. However, it was released without &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot;, which was later included on Rock Band 3. In June 2012, a high fidelity audiophile version of the album was released on HDtracks.com in 24 bit / 96,000khz and 24 bit / 192,000khz resolutions.\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t5/5 stars\nRobert Christgau \t(A)\nSputnikmusic \t5/5 stars\n\nLegend holds the distinction of being the second longest-charting album in the history of Billboard magazine.
