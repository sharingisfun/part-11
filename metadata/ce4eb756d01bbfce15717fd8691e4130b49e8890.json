Mother Brain is trying to conquer Videoland. Kevin has been brought to defeat her, as foretold in an Ancient Prophecy. Kevin is given the title &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. He and Duke join the N Team, which consists of Princess Lana (the Ruler of Videoland), Simon Belmont (the hero from Castlevania), Mega Man, Kid Icarus, and Gameboy (a giant supercomputer). The N Team goes up against the evil Mother Brain (the villain from Metroid) and her minions, King Hippo (Punch-Out), the Eggplant Wizard (Kid Icarus), and Dr. Wily (Mega Man). These forces of good and evil go up against each other and often find themselves in comical, hilarious situations.\n\nBasically this is a reupload since the one I had before was missing a useless file and well It would be marked as incomplete. Enjoy and please seed. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4eb756d01bbfce15717fd8691e4130b49e8890","amp;dn":"Captain+N+The+Game+Master+%28Season+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4eb756d01bbfce15717fd8691e4130b49e8890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,78,183,86,208,27,191,206,21,113,127,216,105,30,65,48,180,158,136,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
