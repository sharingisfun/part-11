It now sounds like you've set up your chaise lounge right in the middle of Rudy Van Gelder's studio!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Blue Note President, Don Was.\n\nCelebrated jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan paved the way for the popularity of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s soul-jazz with the release of his definitive classic The Sidewinder. The title track and one of MorganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature tunes exemplified the soul-jazz genre, later becoming a jazz standard. Recorded in 1963 at Rudy Van GelderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s studio, the highly successful album would chart on both the Billboard 200 and BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top R&amp;B albums. Its provocative phrasing and innovative technique mesmerized audiences. The album includes the hard-bop tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“GaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Notebook,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hocus-PocusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boy, What a Night.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ An absolute essential. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This album is one of Blue Note's classics, coming at just the right time to attract fans who were interested in the burgeoning rock and soul scenes, and the music stands up just as well today.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - All About Jazz\n\n5 out of 5 stars - All Music Guide ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce6d31bedd7d2275ecbc8f02ea24e7cfd4bbf47a","amp;dn":"HDtracks%3A+Lee+Morgan+-+The+Sidewinder+%5B1963%5D+192kHz%2F24bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce6d31bedd7d2275ecbc8f02ea24e7cfd4bbf47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,109,49,190,221,125,34,117,236,188,143,2,234,36,231,207,212,187,244,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
