This is also the Criterion restored 2002 reissue of the original non-linear release cut.\n \n - The protagonist is only referred to as &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; in the title and not in the film itself (Colonel Blimp was a popular satirical cartoon at the time and the file was named after it; this isn't mentioned prominently in the IMDB record)\n \n - Already posted here ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3673600/Life_and_death_of_Colonel_Blimp_PAL_Eng-Spa_DVD9 ) and here ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3281485/%5BCiN%5DThe.Life.and.Death.of.Colonel.Blimp.1943 ) but both of these torrents have been dead for months if not years\n\n - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n \n - This is a long movie and I made it a higher-than-average quality; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so please BE PATIENT.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At &gt;1.1GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cea3463959d9eb636ccb711080d735f03c5d9d11","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Death+of+Colonel+Blimp+%281943%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cea3463959d9eb636ccb711080d735f03c5d9d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,163,70,57,89,217,235,99,108,203,113,16,128,215,53,240,60,93,157,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
