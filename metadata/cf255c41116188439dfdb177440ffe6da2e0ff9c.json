In fact, the rabbit is his only friend. His sister thinks he's lost his marbles and attempts to have him incarcerated in a sanitarium, but it's the mother who's incarcerated instead (albeit temporarily). \n\nThis film possesses sensitivity in terms of the use of &quot;pathos humor&quot;. Stewart is excellent as the man with the imaginary rabbit friend. He considered this film as one of his favorites that he made and is a great film for all ages (not necessarily for nostalgia buffs only).\n\nThe antics with Stewart and his rabbit are hilarious at times, but the viewer can also sympathize with him at times because he associates with this rabbit for most of the time and no one else (from the way he acts and associates with the rabbit, one can tell that he's a pretty lonely man). &quot;Harvey&quot; is also very educational as it presents the theme of &quot;tolerance&quot; very well. \n\nThe picture is still in mint condition for it's time and the direction (forget the director's name) is terrific; not one flaw did I see in this movie as this cast was well directed; the movie flows at a comfortable pace. I remember watching this movie with my dad once, many moons ago, so it does bring back memories (it was one of his favorites). Another trip down memory lane, how nice. Just call it a force of &quot;rabbit&quot; I guess. Don't miss this one in your library or video store.\n\n\nDirected by \nHenry Koster    \n  \nWriting credits \nMary Chase   (play)\n\n \nMary Chase   (screenplay) and  \nOscar Brodney   (screenplay)\n\n \nMyles Connolly   (screenplay) uncredited\n\n \n\nCast (in credits order) verified as complete\n\n James Stewart ...
