In the torrents that say LEV in the file name, these have been enhanced for voice using the freeware audio program called The Levelator.  Leveling the audio makes the torrents more friendly to those who would view at night without having to adjust volume.  Media Player Classic Home Cinema player has few if any audio adjustments which would interfere with these enhancements.\n\nNotes written August 17th, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d031fc213fec734b525564b42a7de913ec4a3b2c","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+Theatre+On+Screen+Henry+IV+Part+Two+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d031fc213fec734b525564b42a7de913ec4a3b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,49,252,33,63,236,115,75,82,85,100,180,42,125,233,19,236,74,59,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
