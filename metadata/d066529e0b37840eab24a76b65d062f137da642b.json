During key moments of gameplay Shattered Dimensions switches to a first-person perspective. During these sequences the player uses the analog sticks to control the given Spider-Man\\'s arms, punching their opponent. Developers described these sequences as a reward for the player.\n Each universe\\'s Spider-Man has a unique fighting technique that distinguishes him from the others. Amazing Spider-Man uses a combination of melee and web-attacks, such as web hammers designed to combine webbing with the environment, mixing up-close and long range combat. Spider-Man Noir uses stealth and timing to silently defeat his enemies in combat . When the player is in the shadows the screen turns black and white, signifying concealment. When the player is exposed in light the screen becomes colored meaning the character can be seen.\n Spider-Man 2099 uses acrobatics and his suit\\'s advanced abilities in combat. He has talons which give him a close combat advantage. He has accelerated vision similar to a spider-reflex which allows him to dodge attacks quickly, much like the Spider-Man 3 video game. Ultimate Spider-Man uses the powers of the symbiote suit to devastate enemies, generating symbiotic spikes and tendrils which act like extensions of his own body. There is also a rage meter for the Ultimate universe, much like the Spider-Man 3 video game.[\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP:\n========================================\n \n3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers* \nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP with Service Pack 3  \nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® CoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 64 X2 3800+ or better \n1 GB of RAM \n14 GB of uncompressed hard disk space \nA 100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible computer system including: \nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c (Included) \n100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers \n100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers \n100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP-compatible DVD-ROM drive and drivers \n \n\n*Supported Chipsets for WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP\n\nAll NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7800 256 MB and better chipsets\n\nAll ATI RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X1800 256 MB and better chipsets\n\nMotherboard integrated video chipsets not supported\n\nMinimum System Requirements for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\n=====================================================\n\n3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers* \nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® with Service Pack 2 or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 \nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® CoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD AthlonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 64 X2 3800+ or better \n2 GB of RAM \n14 GB of uncompressed hard disk space \nA 100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible computer system including: \nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c (Included) \n100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers \n100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers \n100% Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7 compatible DVD-ROM drive and drivers \n \n\n*Supported Chipsets for Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7\nAll NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 7800 256 MB and better chipsets\n\nAll ATI RadeonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ X1800 256 MB and better chipsets\n\nMotherboard integrated video chipsets not supported\n\n \n\n*Important Note: Some 3D accelerator cards with the chipsets listed here may not be compatible with the 3D acceleration features utilized by Spider-ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢: Shattered \n\nDimensions.
