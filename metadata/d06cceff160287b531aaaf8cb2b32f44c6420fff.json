He wrote the song himself, but when it was released, Stan Lewis, the owner of Jewel/Paula Records, and Eleanor Broadwater, the wife of Nashville DJ Gene Nobles, were also credited as co-writers to give them shares of the royalties. Perhaps the most famous cover version is by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their debut album released in 1968. This song was one of their first big hits, and was the band's only Top 40 hit that was not written by John Fogerty, peaking at #11, but made the top ten on some charts. The album version clocks in at 8:37. The single version is split into parts one and two. One difference is that in the single version, the jam session during the coda is omitted in part one. Instead, it fades out with the guitar solo right before the coda which fades in in part two on the B-side. John Fogerty stated in a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone magazine that his purpose in recording &quot;Suzie Q.&quot; was to get the song played on KMPX, a funky progressive-rock radio station in San Francisco, which is why the song was extended to eight minutes in length\n\n              &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; is a hit rock 'n' roll song first recorded in 1958 by the American music legend Little Richard.  The song is ranked #94 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded the song in 1969 with slightly changed lyrics. Instead of the result of the gift of a diamond ring being &quot;When she hugs me, her kissin' make me ting-a-ling-a-ling,&quot; John Fogerty sang, &quot;Would you pardon me a kissin' and a ting-a-ling-a-ling?&quot;\n\n                &quot;Travelin' Band&quot; is a song written by John Fogerty and originally recorded by Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was included on their 1970 album &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot;. Backed with &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot;, it was one of three double sided singles from that album to reach the top five on the U.S. Pop Singles Chart and the first of two to reach the #2 spot on the American charts, alongside &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot;. &quot;Travelin' Band&quot; was also a hit in the UK, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart.It has been covered by a few artists, most notably Elton John, who recorded a cover of the song early in his career. Jerry Lee Lewis sang the song with Fogerty on the album Last Man Standing.\n\n                  &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; is a song written by John Fogerty and originally recorded by Creedence Clearwater Revival for their 1970 album &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot;. Backed with &quot;Travelin' Band&quot;, it was one of three double sided singles from that album to reach the top five on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and the first of two to reach the #2 spot on the American charts, alongside &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot;. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked it #188 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list.\n\n              &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; is a song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong for Motown Records in 1966, and made famous by Marvin Gaye in a single released in October 1968 on Motown's Tamla label.The Gaye recording has since become acclaimed a soul classic, and in 2004, it was placed on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008, Marvin Gaye's &quot;Grapevine&quot; was ranked 65th. It was also inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value.In addition to being recorded several times by Motown artists, the song has been covered by a range of musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival who recorded an eleven-minute version for their 1970 album, &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot;,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06cceff160287b531aaaf8cb2b32f44c6420fff","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+562","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06cceff160287b531aaaf8cb2b32f44c6420fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,108,206,255,22,2,135,181,49,170,175,140,178,179,47,68,198,66,15,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
