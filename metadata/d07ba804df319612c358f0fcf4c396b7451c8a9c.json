Montgomery and David Crystal\nEnglish | 2013 | ISBN: 0226535037 | 240 pages | PDF | 0,8 MB\n\nIn early 2012, the global scientific community erupted with news that the elusive Higgs boson had likely been found, providing potent validation for the Standard Model of how the universe works. Scientists from more than one hundred countries contributed to this discoveryÃ¢â‚¬â€proving, beyond any doubt, that a new era in science had arrived, an era of multinationalism and cooperative reach.\n\nGlobalization, the Internet, and digital technology all play a role in making this new era possible, but something more fundamental is also at work. In all scientific endeavors lies the ancient drive for sharing ideas and knowledge, and now this can be accomplished in a single tongueÃ¢â‚¬â€ English. But is this a good thing?\n\nIn Does Science Need a Global Language?, Scott L. Montgomery seeks to answer this question by investigating the phenomenon of global English in science, how and why it came about, the forms in which it appears, what advantages and disadvantages it brings, and what its future might be. He also examines the consequences of a global tongue, considering especially emerging and developing nations, where research is still at a relatively early stage and English is not yet firmly established.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07ba804df319612c358f0fcf4c396b7451c8a9c","amp;dn":"Does+Science+Need+a+Global+Language%3F%3A+English+and+the+Future+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07ba804df319612c358f0fcf4c396b7451c8a9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,123,168,4,223,49,150,18,195,88,240,252,244,195,150,183,69,28,138,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
