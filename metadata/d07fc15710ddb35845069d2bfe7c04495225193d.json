Yet on the isle of Galatea, an uprising against the ruling aristocrats has turned deadly. The revolutionariesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ weapon is a drug that damages their enemiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brains, and the only hope is rescue by a mysterious spy known as the Wild Poppy.\n\nOn the neighboring island of Albion, no one suspects that the Wild Poppy is actually famously frivolous aristocrat Persis Blake. The teenager uses her shallow, socialite trappings to hide her true purpose: her gossipy flutternotes are encrypted plans, her pampered sea mink is genetically engineered for spying, and her well-publicized new romance with handsome Galatean medic Justen HeloÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ is her most dangerous mission ever.\n\nThough Persis is falling for Justen, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t risk showing him her true self, especially once she learns heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding far more than simply his disenchantment with his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolution and his undeniable attraction to the silly socialite heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretending to love. His darkest secret could plunge both islands into a new dark age, and Persis realizes that when it comes to Justen Helo, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only risking her heart, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s risking the world sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn to protect.\n\nIn this thrilling adventure inspired by The Scarlet Pimpernel, Diana Peterfreund creates an exquisitely rendered world where nothing is as it seems and two teens with very different pasts fight for a future only they dare to imagine.\nGenre: Romance, Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07fc15710ddb35845069d2bfe7c04495225193d","amp;dn":"Across+a+Star-Swept+Sea+-+Diana+Peterfreund.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07fc15710ddb35845069d2bfe7c04495225193d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,127,193,87,16,221,179,88,69,6,157,43,254,124,4,73,82,37,25,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
