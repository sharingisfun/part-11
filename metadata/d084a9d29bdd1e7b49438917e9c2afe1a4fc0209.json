A Decade of Song &amp; Video is Celine Dion's sixth home video release. It's a collection of her English music videos, released on February 20, 2001. This retrospective anthology features videos and live performances of many CÃƒÂ©line Dion favorites, with nine signature singles and seven new tracks. The DVD/CD package containing All the WayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ A Decade of Song album was released on September 22, 2003. In February/March 2009, a Visual Milestones DVD edition was released in Europe and Australia. The classics include &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; &quot;Because You Loved Me,&quot; &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; (duet with R. Kelly). New tracks include a remake of the Roberta Flack classic, &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,&quot; &quot;If Walls Could Talk,&quot; a Mutt Lange tune featuring background vocals by Shania Twain (this video wasn't available before), and &quot;Then You Look at Me,&quot; title track from the Chris Columbus movie The Bicentennial Man which reunites James Horner and Dion. The DVD also includes a bonus video and other goodies. &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; and &quot;To Love You More&quot; were taken from the Live in Memphis home video. &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;All the Way&quot; were taken from the CBS TV special (1999). All the Way... A Decade of Song &amp; Video spent 47 weeks on the Top Music Video Chart in the United States, peaking at number 15. It was certified platinum for selling 100,000 copies. But it's undercertified, because according to Nielsen SoundScan it has sold 300,000 copies till May 2010, and should be 3x platinum. All the Way... A Decade of Song &amp; Video reached number 3 on the Australian Music DVD Chart and spent there over a year. It was certified 8x platinum (120,000). In Sweden, the DVD peaked at number 12.
