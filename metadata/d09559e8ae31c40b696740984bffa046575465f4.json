Delany - Babel-17\nHugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (1967)\nNebula Award for Best Novel (1966)\n\nThe commander of the Earthpeople's Alliance journeyed into the bizarre depths of Transport Town to seek Rydra Wong, the cosmic poetess whose words reached across space and whose mind could perceive the meaning of all the world's tongues. And his request placed her into the heart of the vile interstellar war between the Alliance and the Invaders.\nThe new weapon of the Invaders was Babel-17, a menacing hum clogging up Alliance space communications. Rydra had to decipher the communications power of Babel-17 before it could lead to intergalactic defeat. And to do that, she would have to be the target of the next outer-space attack.\n\nAuthor of the bestselling Dhalgren and winner of four Nebulas and one Hugo, Samuel R. Delany is one of the most acclaimed writers of speculative fiction.\n\nA fascinating tale of a famous poet bent on deciphering a secret language that is the key to the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly force, a task that requires she travel with a splendidly improbable crew to the site of the next attack.\n\nIn the far future, after human civilization has spread through the galaxy, communications begin to arrive in an apparently alien language. They appear to threaten invasion, but in order to counter the threat, the messages must first be understood.\n\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09559e8ae31c40b696740984bffa046575465f4","amp;dn":"Samuel+R.+Delany+-+Babel-17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09559e8ae31c40b696740984bffa046575465f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,149,89,232,174,49,196,11,105,103,64,152,75,255,160,70,87,84,101,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
