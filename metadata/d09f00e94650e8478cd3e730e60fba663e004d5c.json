I noticed that iTunes sometimes rejects certain mp3 files with other encoding, ..So by encoding (Converting) in iTunes, This problem is non existent as iTunes then accepts them as it's own..(so to speak!) ... Long story short, These should all work fine in iTunes &amp; all current versions of Windows Media Player &amp; all other media players that play MP3 files. ... Please comment if any problems Or to say thanks if U like ! ... Hope you enjoy !!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09f00e94650e8478cd3e730e60fba663e004d5c","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Band+of+Joy+%282010%29+MP3+%40+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09f00e94650e8478cd3e730e60fba663e004d5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,159,0,233,70,80,232,71,140,211,231,48,230,15,186,102,62,0,77,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
