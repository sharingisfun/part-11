However, there is one problem... he is not passionate about his job. As he is the son of the house of Kijima, great expectations had been heaped on him from young. Unfortunately for him, no matter what he did, he could never earn the respect and recognition from his father, Kawamura Sesaemon. Due to that, he dislikes the Kabuki world, skipping rehearsals and cutting corners where possible whenever on stage...\n\nSawayama Ichiya was born into a family that is totally unrelated to the Kabuki world, and as such has no hope of ever being the top leading actor. He is the disciple of Sawayama Sakugoro, the head of the house of Todoroki, another prominent Kabuki family. Ichiya is a stoic young man, and he is where he is today due to his talent and diligence. The only way for him to be the successor of Sakugoro, is for him to marry into the family. Incidentally, Sakugoro has only one daughter, Yuna, who loves Ichiya and supports him in his dream to be the top star of Kabuki.\n\nChiba Ayame loves the Kabuki world. Ten years ago, she was introduced to the world of Kabuki, by Ichiya. When her father lost his job, her family had to move away, but till today she holds firm to the words said by Ichiya to her back then; &quot;When I become the top star of Kabuki, I will come look for you&quot;.\n\nOne day, after watching Kyonosuke's pathetic performance, she gets really angry and shouts out asking for a refund. After getting to know her, Kyonosuke starts to fall in love with her. How will the love triangle end? --TBS\n\n\nVIDEO INFO:\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 167 MiB\nDuration : 46mn 30s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 501 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1a52737d725a5629342b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 46mn 30s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 306 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 17.5 Mbps\nWidth : 848 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.025\nStream size : 101 MiB (61%)\n\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 46mn 30s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 219 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\n\nSCREENSHOT:\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/6sDnzer.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/JOKUKOv.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/0xE1cOO.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1763e649a6bfe0ab56f023294427af9a857a4d9","amp;dn":"Pin+to+Kona+%282013%29+Complete+%28Hardsubbed%29+BANKAI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1763e649a6bfe0ab56f023294427af9a857a4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,118,62,100,154,107,254,10,181,111,2,50,148,66,122,249,168,87,164,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
