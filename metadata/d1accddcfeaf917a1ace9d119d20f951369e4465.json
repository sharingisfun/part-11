Your Spectrum\nchanged it's title to Your Sinclair in 1986 and became a more\ngaming-oriented magazine, with a decreasing amount of technical content.\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on\nwww.worldofspectrum.org . They've then been OCR'd to allow text\nsearching and copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair\narchivist who'd like to have their own local searchable archive.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by\nthe relatively low DPI of the source images. Your Spectrum didn't count\nthe front or inside covers as page numbers, so therefore &quot;page 1&quot; is\nusually the contents page - this throws off the page count inside PDF\nviewers. If in doubt, add two to the page number :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check \nfor more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their\nsupport.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.\n\nKen D \n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f2949390859a939199b2959f939b9edc919d9f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1accddcfeaf917a1ace9d119d20f951369e4465","amp;dn":"Your+Spectrum+magazine+complete+OCR%5C%27d+PDFs+%2Arework%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1accddcfeaf917a1ace9d119d20f951369e4465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,172,205,220,254,175,145,122,26,206,157,17,157,32,249,81,54,158,68,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
