The crisis triggered the deepest global recession in 70 years and prompted the US government to spend more than 1 trillion dollars in order to rescue its banking system from collapse. Today the full implications of the crisis in Europe and around the world still remain unclear. Nevertheless, should we accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market? Or is there another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life? Written and directed by Jason Barker - himself an experienced writer, lecturer, translator and doctor of philosophy - Marx Reloaded comprises interviews with the world's leading philosophers of Marxism, including those at the forefront of a popular revival in Marxist and communist ideas. The film also includes interviews with skeptics of this revival as well as light-hearted animation sequences which follow Marx's adventures through the matrix of his own ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d0d9ab1af556736e7d0bb71099f8c723bb35f3","amp;dn":"Marx+Reloaded+%282011%29+TVRip+German+French+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d0d9ab1af556736e7d0bb71099f8c723bb35f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,208,217,171,26,245,86,115,110,125,11,183,16,153,248,199,35,187,53,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
