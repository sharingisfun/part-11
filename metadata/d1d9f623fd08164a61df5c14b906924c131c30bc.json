Lafferty short story ever published. There is nothing else like it in existence.\n\nFor those who do not know, R.A. Lafferty wrote some of the best stories in the English language. His admirers range from Neil Gaiman to Bill Hader to Steely Dan. Shamefully, however, his work remains largely out-of-print. This book is meant to provide some remedy to that.\n\n'The Man Who Talled Tales' is a fully-formatted, rigorously proofed e-book with three active Tables of Contents. It contains 222 stories by R.A. Lafferty drawn from their prior publications.
