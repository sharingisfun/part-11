Black self awareness in Brazil triggered social conflicts that were a large part of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history. The film director wants to illustrate some of those conflicts through the prism of his characters. \n\nCompasso de Espera focuses on a black poet and advertising agent named Jorge de Oliveira (played by ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zimo Bulbul, who also collaborated on the script). Jorge publishes books of poetry - Compasso de Espera is the title of one of his collections - with the help of his sponsor, a childless white millionaire (an allusion to the Brazilian institution of the padrinho, the patron &quot;godfather&quot;). The impeccably dressed, dignified, articulate Jorge at first glance resembles a number of Sidney Poitier characters, but he lacks the moral stature of the Poitier persona. \n\nRomantically involved with an older white woman (Emma), Jorge feels sorry for her, but also resents his financial dependence on her. (Jorge's professional prestige is &quot;traded,&quot; as it were, for Emma's real wealth and for the cultural capital of her whiteness.) Emma's relatives suggest that the couple not appear too much in public, so as to avoid &quot;talk.&quot; Jorge's subsequent infatuation with the upper-class Cristina (Renee de Vilmond) leads to confrontations first with Emma and then with Cristina's family. When Cristina's parents encounter the couple in a restaurant, the mother sneeringly tells her daughter: &quot;I never thought you would stoop so low.&quot; \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Em Compasso de Espera.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 665 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 1 402 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.235\n      Stream size : 944 MiB (84%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 172 MiB (15%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n      Language : portuguese\n\nIMDB: tt0263314\n\nPortuguese audio; no subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by patinhofeio33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1fa3a27b0c3dc031a55002f169004f2be7fc9b5","amp;dn":"Em+Compasso+de+Espera+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1fa3a27b0c3dc031a55002f169004f2be7fc9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,250,58,39,176,195,220,3,26,85,0,47,22,144,4,242,190,127,201,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
