From the corpse factories of World War I where graveyard rats sharpen their teeth on human bones to the wind-blown cemeteries of the prairie where resurrection comes at an unspeakable price...from the compound of a twisted messianic cult leader and his army of zombies to a post-apocalyptic wasteland where all that stands between the living and the evil dead is sacrifice in the form of a lottery. Dead men do tell tales. And these are their stories. Zombie Pulp is a collection of 9 short stories and 2 never before published novellas from the twisted undead mind of Tim Curran.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d224197999c392606ea88aff6796a1ee248679fa","amp;dn":"Zombie+Pulp+-+Tim+Curran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d224197999c392606ea88aff6796a1ee248679fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,36,25,121,153,195,146,96,110,168,138,255,103,150,161,238,36,134,121,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
