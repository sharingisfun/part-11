Is it an artifact of our culture or written in our very DNA? In recent years, the leading linguists have seemingly settled the issue: all languages are fundamentally the same and the particular language we speak does not shape our thinking in any significant way. Guy Deutscher says theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re wrong. From Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, and through a strange and dazzling history of the color blue, Deutscher argues that our mother tongues do indeed shape our experiences of the world. Audacious, delightful, and provocative, Through the Language Glass is destined to become a classic of intellectual discovery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d275f6fd08c708f74c668c8c9e0f9ee9748ad906","amp;dn":"Through+the+Language+Glass+-+Why+the+World+Looks+Different+in+Ot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d275f6fd08c708f74c668c8c9e0f9ee9748ad906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,117,246,253,8,199,8,247,76,102,140,140,158,15,158,233,116,138,217,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
