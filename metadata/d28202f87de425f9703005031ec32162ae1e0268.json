Each conveys the tension and intensity of feeling in the founding period of Israel, a brand-new state with an age-old history. Some are love stories, more are hate stories, and frequently the two urges intertwine.\n\nAmos Oz (b. 1939) is an Israeli writer, novelist, and journalist. He is also a professor of literature at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba. His work has been published in some 41 languages, including Arabic, in 35 countries. Oz has received many honours and awards, among them the Legion of Honour of France, the Goethe Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature, the Heinrich Heine Prize and the Israel Prize. Since 1967, he has been a prominent advocate and major cultural voice of a two-state solution to the IsraeliÃ¢â‚¬â€œPalestinian conflict.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28202f87de425f9703005031ec32162ae1e0268","amp;dn":"Amos+Oz+-+Where+the+Jackals+Howl+%26amp%3B+Other+Stories+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28202f87de425f9703005031ec32162ae1e0268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,130,2,248,125,228,37,249,112,48,5,3,30,195,33,98,174,30,2,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
