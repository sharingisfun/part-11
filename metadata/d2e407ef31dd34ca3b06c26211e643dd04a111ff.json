Through the prisms of archaeology, theology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright's findings overturn basic assumptions about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and are sure to cause controversy. \n \n \nHe explains why spirituality has a role today, and why science, contrary to conventional wisdom, affirms the validity of the religious quest. And this previously unrecognized evolutionary logic points not toward continued religious extremism, but future harmony. \n \n \n\nNearly a decade in the making, The Evolution of God is a breathtaking re-examination of the past, and a visionary look forward.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e407ef31dd34ca3b06c26211e643dd04a111ff","amp;dn":"%5BPulitzer+finalist%5D+The+Evolution+of+God+-+Robert+Wright+%28Epub%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e407ef31dd34ca3b06c26211e643dd04a111ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,228,7,239,49,221,52,202,59,6,194,98,17,230,67,221,4,161,17,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
