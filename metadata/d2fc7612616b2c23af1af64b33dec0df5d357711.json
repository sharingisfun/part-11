Seemingly complex crocheting jargon and techniques are demystified with step-by-step photographs and instructions. Clear diagrams demonstrate how to hold a crochet hook and yarn, and form basic stitches to create a simple scarf. More advanced skillsÃ¯Â¿Â½such as shaping, working in rounds, motifs, and edgingÃ¯Â¿Â½lead into sophisticated projects, including an evening bag, a pillow, and an edged camisole. Designed for the extreme beginner, the manual also contains an index, a list of additional resources, and helpful charts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fc7612616b2c23af1af64b33dec0df5d357711","amp;dn":"Getting+Started+Crochet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fc7612616b2c23af1af64b33dec0df5d357711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,252,118,18,97,107,44,35,175,26,246,75,51,222,192,223,93,53,119,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
