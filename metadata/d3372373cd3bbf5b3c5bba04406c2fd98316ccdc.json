The name &quot;Doonesbury&quot; is a combination of the word doone (prep school slang for someone who is clueless, inattentive, or careless) and the surname of Charles Pillsbury, Trudeau's roommate at Yale University.\n\nDoonesbury is written and penciled by Garry Trudeau, then inked and lettered by his assistant Don Carlton. - wiki\n\nHappy New Year Folks.\n\nI'm looing for the 2010 strips.  Does anyone out there have them???","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3372373cd3bbf5b3c5bba04406c2fd98316ccdc","amp;dn":"Doonesbury+%281968-2009%2C+2011%2C2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3372373cd3bbf5b3c5bba04406c2fd98316ccdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,55,35,115,205,59,191,91,60,91,186,4,64,108,47,217,131,22,204,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
