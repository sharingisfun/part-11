This is particularly true in these days of constant security updates, as replacing operating system components not only increases file fragmentation, but also creates a more insidious problemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½over time, the operating system itself ends up scattered all over your disk.\n\nThis, of course, doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t show up as fragmentationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after all, the files themselves are probably contiguousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but nevertheless, it takes your machine longer to start up, it takes programs longer to start, and it takes longer to get your work done.\n\niDefrag solves these problems and more, by defragmenting and optimizing your MacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s filesystem.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNo serial needed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34846b0fa9d48b8678c6dea43d89a9d6ff47724","amp;dn":"iDefrag+2.1.1.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34846b0fa9d48b8678c6dea43d89a9d6ff47724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,72,70,176,250,157,72,184,103,140,109,234,67,216,154,157,111,244,119,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
