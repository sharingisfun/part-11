Believe me when I say this took quite some time to rip, download, tag, audiocheck and finally upload. Some of these are my own rips and some are taken from torrent sites. I used a program called audiochecker to validate how authentic the FLACs that I downloaded are and the log is included in this torrent (check in the Audiochecker folder). Of course there is no log or cue file with such a torrent but rest assured the rips that I did originally had them and many of the ones I downloaded had them too but I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bother including.\n\nAudiochecker isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t 100% accurate either. For instance, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Day in Your LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by 54-40 comes back as 95% MPEG. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand this at all since I ripped it myself into FLAC. Also, it shows that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack To ParadiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by 38 Special is 54% CDDA and the rest of the tracks are 100%. This is the same 38 Special Greatest Hits torrent I downloaded so why is one track at 54% and all the others at 100%? The ones that come up as ERROR IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure about either ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ many of them I ripped myself (Blue Rodeo, Luba and a few more) So use Audiochecker more as a guideline for quality rather than the absolute truth because I can guarantee its not 100% accurate with its results and can be misleading.\n\n\nAlso, I left the tracks as is. No equalization, no Replay Gain, no nothing. I figured if anyone wanted to &quot;fix&quot; the tracks to their liking they could do it on their end. Some tracks are from&quot;remastered&quot; sources so the volume is much louder than other tracks that haven't been. I don't really consider a lot of remastered music remastered since all they do is up the levels (compression and not in a mp3 sort of way) and brickwall the sound. Most Joe Six Packs prefer this type of sound but the rest of us that actually know what a good recording sounds like (something called Dynamic range that is all but dissappearing in modern recordings) hates this effect.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot more songs that could have been put into this torrent but after a month of working on it I just wanted to start uploading. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m hoping this will meet the needs of a great 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s FLAC torrent.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n\nKit\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks\n\n\n38 Special\tBack to Paradise\n38 Special\tBack Where You Belong\n38 Special\tCaught Up In You\n38 Special\tHold on Loosely\n54-40\tOne Day In Your Life\nABC\tThe Look Of Love\nABC\tWhen Smokey Sings\nAC/DC\tBack in Black\nAC/DC\tHells Bells\nAC/DC\tRock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\nAC/DC\tYou Shook Me All Night Long\nAdam Ant\tGoody Two Shoes\nAerosmith\tAngel\nAerosmith\tDude (looks like a lady)\nAerosmith\t\nA-Ha\tTake On Me\na-ha\tThe Sun Always Shines On T.V.\nAlannah Myles\tBlack Velvet\nAlannah Myles\tLove Is\nAldo Nova\tFantasy\nAlice Cooper\tPoison\nAlison Moyet\tInvisible\nAlphaville\tForever Young\nAmazulu\tMotego Bay\nAnimotion\tObsession\nApril Wine\tJust Between You And Me\nArcadia\tElection Day\nAshford &amp; Simpson\tSolid\nAsia\tHeat Of The Moment\nBad English\tWhen I See You Smile\nBaltimora\tTarzan Boy\nBananarama\tVenus\nBangles\tEternal Flame\nThe Bangles\tManic Monday\nBarney Bental And The Legendary Hearts\tSomething To Live For\nBarney Bentall And The Legendary Hearts\tCome Back To Me\nBeach Boys\tKokomo\nBeastie Boys\tGirls\nBeastie Boys\tNo Sleep Till Brooklyn\nBelinda Carlisle\tCircle In The Sand\nBelinda Carlisle\tHeaven is a Place on Earth\nBelinda Carlisle\tI Get Weak\nBerlin\tTake My Breath Away\nAssorted\tBig Country / In A Big Country\nBilly idol\tDancing with myself\nBilly Idol\tFlesh for Fantasy\nBilly Idol\tWhite Wedding\nBilly Joel\tIt's Still Rock And Roll To Me\nBilly Joel\tUptown Girl\nBilly Joel\tWe Didn't Start The Fire\nBilly Ocean\tCaribbean Queen (No More Love On The Rain)\nBilly Ocean\tLoverboy\nBilly Ocean\tWhen The Going Gets Tough\nBilly Squier\tEverybody Wants You\nBilly Squier\tIn The Dark\nBilly Squier\tMy Kinda Lover\nBilly Squier\tRock Me Tonight\nBilly Squier\tThe Stroke\nBlondie\tCall me\nBlondie\tHeart Of Glass\nAssorted\tBlondie / Rapture\nBlue Rodeo\tDiamond Mine\nBlue Rodeo\tTry\nBobby Brown\tMy Prerogative\nBobby McFerrin\tDon't worry be happy\nBon Jovi\tLivin' On A Prayer\nBon Jovi\tWanted Dead Or Alive\nBon Jovi\tYou Give Love A Bad Name\nBonnie Tyler\tTotal Eclipse of the Heart\nBoston\tAmanda\nBoys Don't Cry\tI Wanna Be A Cowboy\nBrighton Rock\tOne more try\nBronski Beat\tSmalltown Boy - Extended Mix\nBruce Cockburn\tIf A Tree Falls\nBruce Cockburn\tIf I Had A Rocket Launcher\nBruce Cockburn\tLovers In A Dangerous Time\nBruce Springsteen\tBorn in the U.S.A.\nBruce Springsteen\tBrilliant Disguise\nBruce Springsteen\tDancing in the Dark\nBruce Springsteen\tGlory Days\nBruce Springsteen\tMy Hometown\nBruce Springsteen\tTunnel Of Love\nBruce Springsteen\tHuman Touch\nBryan Adams\tHeaven\nBryan Adams\tRemember\nBryan Adams\tRun to You\nBryan Adams\tStraight From the Heart\nBryan Adams\tSummer of 69\nBryan Adams\tThis Time\nBuster Poindexter\tHot Hot Hot\nB.V.S.M.P.\tI need you\nCameo\tWord Up\nChaka Khan\tI Feel For You\nCheap Trick\tAll We Need Is A Dream\nCheap Trick\tIf You Want My Love\nCheap Trick\tThe Flame\nCher\tIf I Could Turn Back Time\nChicago\tAlong Comes a Woman\nChicago\tHard habit to Break\nChicago\tHard to Say I'm Sorry - Get Away\nChicago\tStay the Night\nChicago\tWill You Still Love Me\nChina Crisis\tWorking With Fire And Steel\nChris Isaak\tWicked Game\nChristopher Cross\tArthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\nCinderella\tBad Seamstress Blues / Fallin' Apart At The Seams\nCinderella\tComing Home\nClarence Clemons &amp; Jackson Browne\tYou're a Friend of Mine\nClub Nouveau\tLean On Me\nColin James\tJust Came Back\nCorey Hart\tA Little Love\nCorey Hart\tIt Ain't Enough\nCorey Hart\tShe Got The Radio\nCorey Hart\tSunglasses At Night\nCrowded House\tDon't Dream It's Over\nCrowded House\tSomething So Strong\nCrowded House\tWorld Where You Live\nCulture Club\tDo you really want to hurt me?\nCulture Club\tKarma Chameleon\nCutting Crew\t(I Just) Died In Your Arms\nCyndi Lauper\tAll Through The Night\nCyndi Lauper\tGirls Just Want To Have Fun\nCyndi Lauper\tShe Bop\nCyndi Lauper\tTime After Time\nCyndi Lauper\tWhen You Were Mine\nDan Hartman\tI Can Dream About You\nDan Hill ft.
