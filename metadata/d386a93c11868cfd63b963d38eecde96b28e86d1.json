Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems: A Consensus Region Approach offers a systematic framework for designing distributed controllers for multi-agent systems with general linear agent dynamics, linear agent dynamics with uncertainties, and Lipschitz nonlinear agent dynamics.\n\nBeginning with an introduction to cooperative control and graph theory, this monograph:\n\n    Explores the consensus control problem for continuous-time and discrete-time linear multi-agent systems\n    Studies the HÃ¢Ë†Å¾ and H2 consensus problems for linear multi-agent systems subject to external disturbances\n    Designs distributed adaptive consensus protocols for continuous-time linear multi-agent systems\n    Considers the distributed tracking control problem for linear multi-agent systems with a leader of nonzero control input\n    Examines the distributed containment control problem for the case with multiple leaders\n    Covers the robust cooperative control problem for multi-agent systems with linear nominal agent dynamics subject to heterogeneous matching uncertainties\n    Discusses the global consensus problem for Lipschitz nonlinear multi-agent systems\n\nCooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems: A Consensus Region Approach provides a novel approach to designing distributed cooperative protocols for multi-agent systems with complex dynamics. The proposed consensus region decouples the design of the feedback gain matrices of the cooperative protocols from the communication graph and serves as a measure for the robustness of the protocols to variations of the communication graph. By exploiting the decoupling feature, adaptive cooperative protocols are presented that can be designed and implemented in a fully distributed fashion.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (October 29, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1466569948\nISBN-13: 978-1466569942\n\nAbout the Author\n\nZhongkui Li holds a BS from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China and a Ph.D from Peking University, Beijing, China.
