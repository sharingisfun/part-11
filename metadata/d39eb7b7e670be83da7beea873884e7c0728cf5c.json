A nuclear exchange in the\nMiddle East kills 20 million people and cripples the\nworld's oil supply. Crude oil prices spike at $800 a\nbarrel.\n\nOne year later, the threat of world-wide nuclear war is\neliminated when the United States and Europe deploy a\ncomprehensive space-based anti-ballistic missile shield.\nRussia soon follows with an advanced missile defense\nsystem of its own. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are\nrendered obsolete.\n\nRussia becomes the world's primary supplier of energy and\nexperiences a massive economic boom. With its newfound\nriches, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a major\nsuperpower and restores her military might.\n\nWestern Europe, with the notable exception of the UK and\nIreland, unifies to create the European Federation. This\nnew nation is destined to be a formidable 21st-century\nSuperpower.\n\nIn 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing\nconstruction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital\nmilitary platform that will upset the balance of world\npower. The European Federation withdraws from NATO in\nprotest.\n\nTensions between the European Federation, the United\nStates, and Russia are building and will soon reach the\nbreaking point.\n\nThe EndWar is about to begin.\n\nINSTALL NOTES for Tom Clancy's End War (c) UBI SOFT.ViTALiTY-NoRarÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n\n~ Unpack Well already done for you!\n~ Burn or mount\n~ Continue to decompose","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39eb7b7e670be83da7beea873884e7c0728cf5c","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancys+End+War+VITALiTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39eb7b7e670be83da7beea873884e7c0728cf5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,158,183,183,230,112,190,131,218,123,238,168,115,136,78,124,7,40,207,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
