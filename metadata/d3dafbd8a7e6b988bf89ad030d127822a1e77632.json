He is uproariously funny, and it is hard to believe that he went from doing this to fluff like &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (a good show, but not anything like his early standup). \n\nChris Rock is also good. He is very young here, but he already has his &quot;born suspect&quot; act nailed. He is pretty good for an up-and-coming comedian, and any fan of his should watch this movie.\n\nAnd, of course, there's Bill Hicks, who outshines everyone else by far (Allen made me laugh the hardest, but Bill still has the better act). He was one hell of a comedian, and almost makes this DVD worth buying, ALMOST lol. What they were thinking when they they thought they could group a genius like Hicks with a hack the likes of Stephanie Hodge in one DVD is beyond me....but here it is.\n\nThe title doesn't lie either--these 12 performers really are comedy's dirtiest. The humor is vulgar, shocking, and totally filthy, but only the four names you know, know how to do it right. \n\n\n5/10 stars for the video as a whole, 8/10 for the names you know. \n\n\nFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFile size : 699 MiB \nDuration : 1h 29mn \n\nVideo \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Streaming Video@L1 \nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom \nCodec ID : XVID \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 1h 29mn \nBit rate : 951 Kbps \nWidth : 512 pixels \nHeight : 384 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4/3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nResolution : 24 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.161 \nStream size : 612 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01) \n\nAudio \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 1h 29mn \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : 120 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nStream size : 77.2 MiB (11%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 524 ms \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3dafbd8a7e6b988bf89ad030d127822a1e77632","amp;dn":"%5BChris.Rock.Tim.Allen%5D.Comedy%5C%27s.Dirtiest.Dozen.1988.DvDrip.Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3dafbd8a7e6b988bf89ad030d127822a1e77632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,218,251,216,167,230,185,136,191,137,173,3,13,18,120,34,161,231,118,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
