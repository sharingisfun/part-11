Gabey falls head over heels for &quot;Miss Turnstiles of the Month&quot; (he thinks she's a high society deb when she's really a 'cooch dancer at Coney Island); innocent Chip gets highjacked (literally) by a lady cab driver; and Ozzie becomes the object of interest of a gorgeous anthropologist who thinks he's the perfect example of a &quot;prehistoric man&quot;.\n\nAllmovie :Sailors Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie are very excited about getting a 24-hour leave and spending it in New York, New York - a wonderful town! They are especially concerned with the female inhabitants of the city, and each finds his own to cuddle up with. Chip tries but can't resist the horny advances of a cab driver, Ozzie gladly fills the role of a lovely anthropologist's &quot;prehistoric man,&quot; and after much desperate searching, Gabey finds the model who poses for the Miss Turnstiles advertisements, who isn't quite the glamorous celebrity he envisioned but nevertheless will do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3fa738741ca05e0e38b71c5e2f1e49508a7e449","amp;dn":"On+The+Town+1949+Musical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3fa738741ca05e0e38b71c5e2f1e49508a7e449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,250,115,135,65,202,5,224,227,139,113,197,226,241,228,149,8,167,228,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
