Lucinda (Danielle Cormack, Topless Women Talk About Their Lives) \nfears that the spark has gone out of her romance with Rob (Karl Urban, \nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers), a dairy farmer in lush New Zealand. \nA treacherous friend advises Lucinda to test her beloved's love, but the tests \nlead to the loss of their cows and possibly all hope for true love. \nThe Price of Milk  abounds with surreal touches (like an agoraphobic dog \nwho wears a cardboard box and a family of magical golfing Maori) and events \nthat may not make rational sense, but are absolutely perfect nonetheless. \nA wonderful film with an adorable cast. --Bret Fetzer (Amazon)\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
