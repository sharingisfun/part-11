This appears to be only the beginning of a string of suicides around the country. Does the new all-girl group Desert have anything to do with it? Detective Kuroda tries to find the answer, which isn't as simple as one could hope.  \n\nAmazing movie if you don't mind reading subtitles.\nRecommend to anyone looking for a good movie that's just off the beaten path.\nIts very intimidate and draws you in quick.\nDon't expect much closure in this story. In my opinion, the best movies leave you thinking. \n\nENJOY!\n\n\nPlease seed after dl'n. I will seed for only two weeks. If you are still interested after that, let me know and I'll do my best to accommodate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41a474ff4bfedd570345399014023d8023ba44e","amp;dn":"Suicide+Club+%5B2001%5D+%28Japan-Jisatsu+s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d41a474ff4bfedd570345399014023d8023ba44e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,26,71,79,244,191,237,213,112,52,83,153,1,64,35,216,2,59,164,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
