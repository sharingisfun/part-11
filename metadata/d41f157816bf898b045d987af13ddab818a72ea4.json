ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reason that deck building is the most popular do-it-yourself home improvement undertaking today: not only are decks an attractive, customizable component of classic American construction, they also allow for entertainment and relaxation in a way that indoor spaces simply canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. So if your house is already in top working order, and your lawn is looking mighty green this year, chances are thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one thing missingÃ¢â‚¬â€a deck. Fortunately, with all the innovative new products and materials coming onto the market, decks are easier to self-design and build than ever before. As it turns out, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re only one how-to book away from creating the deck of your dreams. In HomeSkills: Building Decks, the expert editors of Cool Springs Press join forces to cover every aspect of deck building, providing streamlined project descriptions with crystal-clear photos that leave no room for guesswork. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to plan and design, then select materials, dig postholes, hang joists, and install the decking itself. We even cover stairs, railings, overheads, and extra accessories like screens and arbors. With 300 illustrations and 10 supplementary diagrams, one thorough book prevents two things from collapsing: you and your shiny new deck. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good for all of us. Check out our five other HomeSkills guides on carpentry, landscaping, plumbing, tiling, and wiring.\n\nBy Editors of Cool Springs Press\nPublished by Cool Springs Press in 2013\nPDF, Retail, 128 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41f157816bf898b045d987af13ddab818a72ea4","amp;dn":"HomeSkills%3ABuilding+Decks%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d41f157816bf898b045d987af13ddab818a72ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,31,21,120,22,191,137,139,4,93,152,122,241,61,218,184,24,167,46,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
