See why charcoal is the best fuel for bladesmithing and how it's used in the Lively Forge that is specially designed for knifemakers. \n\nWithout the use of expensive machinery and large shop space a handmade knife is forged to finish with only muscle powered tools. This allows for more self reliance and the freedom needed for even a beginner to use the information here and create a one of a kind custom knife. The benefit of working so intimately with each piece is that it gives the finished knife your unique artistic signature!\n\nSince the most important part of finishing a blade is the heat treatment, it is shown and explained in great detail. \n\nYou'll also learn how to make a professional quality leather sheath with some unlikely but accessible tools.\n\n********************************************************\nThis info is brought to you by:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/KnifemakerC/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/KnifemakerC/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPositive comments and thanks are appreciated.  \nIt's my only payoff for all the time and money spent here.\n\n\nDemonoid members may PM related requests and interesting finds\nto account    LurkerLurker     (unable to post the link here)\n\n\nI choose to use full quality ISO files whenever possible.\n\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    ####\n####    See my other knife related torrents and please seed.    #### \n\n********************************************************\n\nTags\naustenite forging, subzero quench, vasco wear, braze rod, flat grind, grit marks, hardy hole, hot chisel, grind lines, belt grinder, temper line, anvil surface, surrounding strands, carbon migration, cross peen, final grind, grip material, green coal, hollow grind, welding temperature, pattern welding, first weld, blade cool, rough grinding, weld surfaces, Heat treat\n\nForge a frontier hawk, Hawk, Tomahawk, Bruce Evans, axe, make a tomahawk, make a hawk, forge, hot forge, quench, Sword, Blade, Blades, knifemaker, knife, Make a Knife, video, stock removal, abs, abs mastersmith, Metalwork, Steel, Tool Steel, Craft, Hobby craft, Heat Treat, Bowie, Daggar, Dagger, tpb knifemaking, tpb knife, tpb blade, tpb knifemaker, knifemaking torrent, knife torrent, bladesmith torrent, forge torrent, make a knife torrent, torrent, blade torrent, Grinder\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45597cf1bc183ed31f4bf95f8ff8101674b3811","amp;dn":"Knifemaking+Unplugged-Lively+Forge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45597cf1bc183ed31f4bf95f8ff8101674b3811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,85,151,207,27,193,131,237,49,244,191,149,248,255,129,1,103,75,56,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
