The ringleader of this cover-up, Masako Katori,\nemerges as the emotional heart of Out and as one of the shrewdest,\nmost clear-eyed creations in recent fiction.\n\nMasako's own search for a way out of the straitjacket of a dead end\nlife leads her, too, to take drastic action. The complex yet riveting\nnarrative seamlessly combines a convincing glimpse into the grimy\nworld of Japan's yakuza with a brilliant portrayal of the psychology\nof a violent crime and the ensuing game of cat-and-mouse between\nseasoned detectives and a group of determined but inexperienced\ncriminals. Kirino has mastered a Thelma and Louise kind of graveyard\nhumor than illuminators her stunning evocation of the pressures\nand prejudices that drive women to extreme deeds and the friendship\nthat bolsters them in the aftermath.\n\nOut\nBy: Natsuo Kirino\nLanguage: EN\nFormat: PDF\nPages: 520\nISBN13: 9781400078370","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4646af37594420dfa7910b70bb5d748e1b9299e","amp;dn":"Out+by+Natsuo+Kirino+%5BEnglish+version%5D+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4646af37594420dfa7910b70bb5d748e1b9299e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,100,106,243,117,148,66,13,250,121,16,183,11,181,215,72,225,185,41,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
