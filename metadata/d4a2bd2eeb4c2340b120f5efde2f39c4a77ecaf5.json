Theatre Works Audio Theatre Collection series recordings of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest starring Charles Busch, James Marsters, and Matthew Wolf and Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing starring Simon Templeman and Joanne Whalley. Each show is on two discs, divided into tracks by scenes for easy navigation. 4 discs, total.\n\nAbout Book:\n___\n\nOscar Wilde's madcap farce about mistaken identities, secret engagements, and lovers entanglements still delights readers more than a century after its 1895 publication and premiere performance. The rapid-fire wit and eccentric characters of The Importance of Being Earnest have made it a mainstay of the high school curriculum for decades.\n\nCecily Cardew and Gwendolen Fairfax are both in love with the same mythical suitor. Jack Worthing has wooed Gewndolen as Ernest while Algernon has also posed as Ernest to win the heart of Jack's ward, Cecily. When all four arrive at Jack's country home on the same weekend the &quot;rivals&quot; to fight for Ernest s undivided attention and the &quot;Ernests&quot; to claim their beloveds pandemonium breaks loose. Only a senile nursemaid and an old, discarded hand-bag can save the day!\n\nThis Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition includes a glossary and reader's notes to help the modern reader appreciate Wilde's wry wit and elaborate plot twists.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Library Access (2009)\nASIN: B004CMFKYI\n\n Simon Templeman (Narrator), Joanne Whalley (Narrator)\n\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
