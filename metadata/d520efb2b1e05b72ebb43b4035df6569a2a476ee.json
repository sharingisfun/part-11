Yancey Cravat (Glenn Ford) is an impulsive, short-fused cowboy who has married an immigrant woman, Sabra (Maria Schell). Together, Yancey and Sabra claim a homestead, and Yancey starts a newspaper. While he doesn't have much of a head for business, Sabra does, and when she takes greater control of the paper, it grows into a profitable and influential journal. Eventually, Yancey becomes a well-recognized figure, and it's suggested that he run for public office. However, Yancey finds himself unable to support legislation that would steal more land and mineral rights away from the Native Americans who first settled the land. Cimarron  was previously filmed in 1931; this version reduced the role of stereotyped black characters and has Native American actors playing the &quot;Indians,&quot; including Eddie  and Dawn Little Sky. \n\n# Actors: Glenn Ford, Maria Schell, Anne Baxter, Arthur O'Connell, Russ Tamblyn\n# Directors: Anthony Mann, Charles Walters\n# Writers: Arnold Schulman, Edna Ferber\n# Producers: Edmund Grainger\n\nFILE_NAME                      Cimarron.1960.Anthony.Mann.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.2Ch.avi\nFILE_SIZE                      2,342,604,800\nCONT_AUDIO_STREAM_COUNT        1\nCONT_BASETYPE                  AVI(.AVI)\nCONT_BYTES_MISSING             0\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_ALIGN          Split\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_PRELOAD        96\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_TIME           96\nCONT_SUBTYPE                   Multipart OpenDML AVI (2 parts), \nCONT_TOTAL_BITRATE             0\nVIDEO_BITRATE                  1921\nVIDEO_CODEC_NAME               XviD 1.1.2 Final\nVIDEO_CODEC_TYPE               XVID\nVIDEO_DAR                      2.368\nVIDEO_DURATION                 2:27:31\nVIDEO_FRAME_COUNT              212212\nVIDEO_FRAMES_PER_SEC           23.976\nVIDEO_MPEG4                    MPEG-4\nVIDEO_MPEG4_BVOP               B-VOP\nVIDEO_PAR                      1.000\nVIDEO_PICS_PER_SEC             23.976\nVIDEO_QF                       0.366\nVIDEO_SAR                      2.368\nVIDEO_SIZE_X                   720\nVIDEO_SIZE_Y                   304\nAUDIO_BITRATE                  192\nAUDIO_BITRATE_TYPE             CBR\nAUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT            2\nAUDIO_CODEC                    0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE              48000\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d520efb2b1e05b72ebb43b4035df6569a2a476ee","amp;dn":"Cimarron+-+Anthonny+Mann+%281960%29+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d520efb2b1e05b72ebb43b4035df6569a2a476ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,32,239,178,177,224,91,114,235,180,59,64,53,223,101,105,162,164,118,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
