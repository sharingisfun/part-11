This documentary traces the life and career of the young man dubbed the unofficial &quot;Mayor of Harlem.&quot; Business smarts and hard work led to street fame and enormous fortune for the friends, but when flashy Porter neglected to pay money he owed to the more unassuming Alpo, the rift in their partnership led to betrayal, murder and prison.\nEagerly anticipated story about the most popular guy in the most trend-setting part of the world...Harlem. As a young boy growing up in Harlem, Alpo and his friends (AZ &amp; Rich Porter from GAME OVER) took advantage of a power vacuum in the drug game after the head kingpins from the '70s were either killed or incarcerated. Through business savvy (offering the lowest drug prices in town), hard work (on the streets at 5:30am), and charismatic public relations (their civic generosity included bi-annual bbq's and 4th of July celebrations that everyone was invited to) Alpo became the unofficial &quot;Mayor of Harlem&quot;. Watch as ambition turns to greed, which leads to murder.\n\nScreenshots\n[IMG]http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/961/snapshot20110303011452.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/9702/snapshot20110303011548.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/5237/snapshot20110303011627.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/8792/snapshot20110303011649.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/8919/snapshot20110303011701.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/9297/snapshot20110303011721.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAudio/ Video\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 624x406 29.97fps 2016Kbps [Video 0]\nAudio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 256Kbps [Audio 1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d558d8a6e3505e61d26c30a4d862d84892174d1f","amp;dn":"The+Alpo+Story+%5B2007%5DDvdrip+-GOD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d558d8a6e3505e61d26c30a4d862d84892174d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,88,216,166,227,80,94,97,210,108,48,164,216,98,216,72,146,23,77,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
