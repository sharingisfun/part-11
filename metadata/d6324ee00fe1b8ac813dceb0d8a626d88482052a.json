One of the defining albums of 70s hard rock from one of the 60s most successful bands, the original album includes some of The Who's best-known work, such as the anthemic &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, the by turns sorrowful and angry &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, and perennial favorite &quot;My Wife&quot;. The new tracks on this album are equally worth hearing, including &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; (an alternate edition of which is available on Odds &amp; Sods) and the original version of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;. A hard rock classic, Who's Next is required listening for rock fans of all ages.\n\n\n\n1 \tBaba O'Riley \t\n2 \tBargain \t\n3 \tLove Ain't for Keeping \t\n4 \tMy Wife \t\n5 \tThe Song is Over \t\n6 \tGetting in Tune \t\n7 \tGoing Mobile \t\n8 \tBehind Blue Eyes \t\n9 \tWon't Get Fooled Again \t\n10 \tPure and Easy [#] \t\n11 \tBaby Don't You Do It [#] \t\n12 \tNaked Eye [Live] \t\n13 \tWater [#][Live] \t\n14 \tToo Much of Anything \t\n15 \tI Don't Even Know Myself \t\n16 \tBehind Blue Eyes [#] \t\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 178 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 17mn 55s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Who's Next [Bonus Tracks]\nAlbum/Performer                          : The Who\nPerformer                                : The Who\nComposer                                 : John Entwistle\nPublisher                                : Polydor\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1971\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 1h 17mn 55s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel count                            : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n***FRONT COVER***\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GfDCloF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GfDCloF.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***BACK COVER***\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XlJgsnl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XlJgsnl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6324ee00fe1b8ac813dceb0d8a626d88482052a","amp;dn":"The+Who.1995.WHO%27S+NEXT.%28Bonus+Tracks%29.%5BMp3%5D.320Kbps.-ROSTROMASC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6324ee00fe1b8ac813dceb0d8a626d88482052a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,50,78,224,15,225,184,172,129,61,206,176,216,166,38,216,132,130,5,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
