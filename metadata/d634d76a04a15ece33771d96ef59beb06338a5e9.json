Lead singer Freddie Garrity (born November 14, 1940) began playing in skiffle groups in the late '50s, switching to rock &amp; roll in the early '60s. After the Beatles broke the American market wide open, Freddie &amp; the Dreamers followed in the flood of acts that tried to duplicate the overwhelming success of the Beatles. The group's hits were more numerous in the U.K. than in America, where they had only one Top Ten hit, the number one &quot;I'm Telling You Now.&quot; As 1965 turned into 1966, the group stopped charting in the U.S. and the hits began to dwindle in the U.K.; by 1968 the original group disbanded. Garrity continues to tour with a new version of the Dreamers.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqe5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqe5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nYes, &quot;I'm Telling You Now&quot; is here, and so is &quot;Do the Freddie,&quot; an absurd attempt at fashioning a dance craze, but so are &quot;How About Trying Your Luck With Me,&quot; &quot;When I'm Home With You,&quot; and &quot;Brown and Porters (Meat Exporters) Lorry.&quot; In other words, it's more than a definitive collection, with 25 tracks (many previously unreleased in the U.S.) and a comprehensive discography.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:jifuxqy5ldde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:jifuxqy5ldde&lt;/a&gt;\nExcept the picture and track list are incorrect\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008FSJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008FSJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
