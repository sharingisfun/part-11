The film chronicles the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird that began with the 1979 NCAA Basketball Championship Game and lasted throughout their lengthy Hall of Fame careers in the NBA. The film makes an argument that without the massive media attention that was placed on the rivalry that Magic and Bird had, the NBA might not have made it through the 1980s following the merger with the ABA, among other things.\n\n[b][color=red]Video[/color][/b]\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 3 476 Kbps\nLength : 2.13 GiB for 1h 27mn 49s 317ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 3 151 Kbps\nAspect : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 60.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 317 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ca6c0c1aeaf4c2126af7e40a715e1ccecdec5b","amp;dn":"Magic+%26amp%3B+Bird+-+A+Courtship+of+Rivals+HDTV+%5BKNIX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ca6c0c1aeaf4c2126af7e40a715e1ccecdec5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,202,108,12,26,234,244,194,18,106,247,228,10,113,94,28,206,205,236,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
