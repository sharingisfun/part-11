In the first film, Stanley Banks was forced to endure the chaotic events leading up to the wedding. This time, he must comes to grips with the prospect of becoming a grandfather. Once he's reconciled himself to this jolt of mortality, Stanley must contend with the little bundle of joy, who screams his head off every time Grandpa comes near him. Father's Little Dividend was remade in 1994 as Father of the Bride II, with Steve Martin assuming the Spencer Tracy role, and with the added complication of discovering that his own wife (Diane Keaton) is also pregnant. The copyright for Father's Little Dividend was not renewed in 1978; thus the film has lapsed into public domain. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043526/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043526/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nVincente Minnelli\n\n\n\n\n\tSpencer Tracy\t... \tStanley Banks\n\tJoan Bennett\t... \tEllie Banks\n\n\tElizabeth Taylor... \tKay Dunstan\n\tDon Taylor\t... \tBuckley Dunstan\n\n\tBillie Burke\t... \tDoris Dunstan\n\n\n\nVideo #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.109\n      Stream size : 581 MiB (83%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 - 192 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 112 MiB (16%)\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f220eec50406c9a62e8f836b59eec68d7f4eb4","amp;dn":"Father%5C%27s+Little+Dividend+%281951%29+Spencer+Tracy+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f220eec50406c9a62e8f836b59eec68d7f4eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,242,32,238,197,4,6,201,166,46,143,131,107,89,238,198,141,127,78,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
