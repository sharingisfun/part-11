Her name is Hundra, the finest warrior of her people. \n\nHundra seeks out her elder, she leads a valiant tribe of women who dares to be free. \n\nWritten by Anthony Pereyra {&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c9a1b0b9acbbbaa6a7a0aaf0f889b0a8a1a6a6e7aaa6a4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;} \n\nthanks hypersonic\n\n\nThis is another misplaced adventure film from the dvd box set Sci- Fi Invasion.  I'm not torrenting all of them and certainly not in one folder but Hundra kept me\nwatching. The cast of the tribe of women seems totally engaged in the fight scenes\nearly in the film.  It looks liek it could have been from Game Of Thrones save for \nmore limited budget.  And Laurene Landon seems to be enjoying acting the character \nimmensely.  Not all of the film is even and there are many of the usual cliches.  But Hundra was made at a time-- 1983  the same year or close to it when another Women of power film was made that reappeared at the beginning of the Occupy movement.  It is called Born In Flames by Lizzie Borden which is an independent near future  after the Revolution pic.I am also torrenting &quot;Born In Flames&quot; and am adding it to various indexes.\n  These years were a time of experimenting with new ideas. They are valuable more for what was accomplished rather than being berated for limited production style.\n\n  Enjoy Hundra and seed along with me as part of your permanent collection.\n\n The supply of these B-pictures is not inexhaustible, it just seems that way.\nHelp me in the search to find some more.  Example:  I'm a big Abby Dalton fan from \nwhen she was on tv in a program called Hennessy with Jackie Cooper.  There's a Hundra style primitive girl tribe picture called   The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent (1957) Please get this on the torrents if you can find it.\n\nUpdate:  I have acquired The Saga of the Viking Women....&quot;  and it is now going.\n\n\nNotes written for TPB November 2, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d70cc8221c2aad23b9c33d359b951d6000a6715d","amp;dn":"Hundra+%281983%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d70cc8221c2aad23b9c33d359b951d6000a6715d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,12,200,34,28,42,173,35,185,195,61,53,155,149,29,96,0,166,113,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
