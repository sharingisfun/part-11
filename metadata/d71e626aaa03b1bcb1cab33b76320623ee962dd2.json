Of these you could easily imagine A Heart Needs A Home or The Dimming Of The Day becoming an X Factor staple in the same way that DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s To Make You Feel My Love has (note to X Factor contestants: youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re never going to do it better than Adele. Do one of these songs instead). Meanwhile, the most thrilling moments are when, newly divorced and living in America after spending some of the later 70s in a Sufi commune, RT discovers New Wave and lets rip on a particularly savage Shoot Out The Lights and She Twists The Knife Again. Thompson occupies a very rare position, shared perhaps only by Lindsay Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac, of being a virtuoso guitarist able to solo endlessly without ever resorting to clichÃƒÂ© but also being able to write incredible songs to put the solos in. Curiously, his later career peak of 1999s Mock Tudor album is neglected entirely in favour of songs from its follow up Old Kit Bag of which Outside Of The Inside (essentially a modern Muslim taking the piss out of the Taliban) is a particular standout.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71e626aaa03b1bcb1cab33b76320623ee962dd2","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson+-+Live+at+the+BBC+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71e626aaa03b1bcb1cab33b76320623ee962dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,30,98,106,170,3,177,188,177,202,179,59,118,50,6,35,238,150,45,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
