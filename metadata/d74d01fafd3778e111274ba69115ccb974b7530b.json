Based upon a series of short bite-sized chapters, his approach allows us to safely navigate through the constant chatter of emails, text messages, phone calls, and endless meetings that prevent us from focusing our time on those things that are truly important to us. \n\nMixing first-person insights along with unique case studies, Bregman sprinkles his charming book with pathways which help guide us -- pathways that can get us on the right trail in 18 minutes or less.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74d01fafd3778e111274ba69115ccb974b7530b","amp;dn":"Peter.Bregman.18Minutes.epub+FFAY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74d01fafd3778e111274ba69115ccb974b7530b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,77,1,250,253,55,120,225,17,39,75,166,145,21,204,185,116,183,83,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
