While on the subject of catchy tunes, all ears should be directed to the biblically-derived title &quot;Shadrack,&quot; which had been a signature piece for Louis Armstrong. \n\nThis early incarnation of the Sonny Rollins Quartet have rarely sounded as cohesive as they collectively percolate with their definitive execution. Of particular note is the inclusion of Miles Davis' &quot;I Know&quot; -- an extension of Charlie Parker's &quot;Confirmation&quot; -- which features Davis on piano accompanying Rollins with solid chord progressions that allow the burgeoning player to lead his first-ever quartet with Heath and Roy Haynes (drums). \nLindsay Planer\n\n\n01 Time on My Hands   (Adamson, Gordon, Youmans)   2:38\n02 This Love of Mine   (Parker, Sanicola, Sinatra)   2:22\n03 Shadrack   (MacGimsey)   2:29\n04 Slow Boat to China   (Loesser)   2:38\n05 Scoops   (Rollins)   2:13\n06 With a Song in My Heart   (Hart, Rodgers)   3:06\n07 Newk's Fadeaway   (Rollins)   3:10\n08 I Know   (Davis)   2:33\n\nRecorded on January 17, 1951 (track 8) and December 10, 1951\n\n\nSonny Rollins tenor sax\nKenny Drew piano (track 1-7)\nMiles Davis piano (track 8)\nPercy Heath bass\nArt Blakey drums (track 1-7)\nRoy Haynes drums (track 8)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7657623e6d847d21bba7762e88e3e77258f115e","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+-+Sonny+Rollins+Quartet+%40320+%281951%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7657623e6d847d21bba7762e88e3e77258f115e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,101,118,35,230,216,71,210,27,186,119,98,232,142,62,119,37,143,17,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
