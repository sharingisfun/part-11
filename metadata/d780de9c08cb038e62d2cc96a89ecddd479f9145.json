Orcish hordes invaded human territory and the king of the land needed a lot of ore to forge enough weapons, should his army stand against this threat. Whoever breaks the law in these darkest of times is sentenced to serve in the giant penal colony of Khorinis, mining the so much needed ore.\n\nThe whole area, dubbed &quot;the Colony&quot;, is surrounded by a magical barrier, a sphere two kilometres diameter, sealing off the penal colony from the outside world. The barrier can be passed from the outside in Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but once inside, nobody can escape. The barrier was a double-edged sword - soon the prisoners took the opportunity and started a revolt. The Colony became divided into three rivalling factions and the king was forced to negotiate for his ore, not just demand it.\n\nYou are thrown through the barrier into this prison. With your back against the wall, you have to survive and form volatile alliances until you can finally escape.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\nDaikatana\nMessiah\nChildren of the Nile Complete\nStill Life 1\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d780de9c08cb038e62d2cc96a89ecddd479f9145","amp;dn":"Gothic+1+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d780de9c08cb038e62d2cc96a89ecddd479f9145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,128,222,156,8,203,3,142,98,210,204,150,168,158,205,221,71,159,145,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
