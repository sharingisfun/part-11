Most notably, some have suggested that a scene depicting preparation for the bombing of the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the FBI national headquarters, served as the inspiration for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 by Timothy McVeigh, who had promoted the book.[5][6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d786d020932a5b294d55ca9f16fd22290d6bcc3c","amp;dn":"William+Pierce+-+The+Turner+Diaries++Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d786d020932a5b294d55ca9f16fd22290d6bcc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,134,208,32,147,42,91,41,77,85,202,159,22,253,34,41,13,107,204,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
