The Age of Globalization (previously published as Under Three Flags) is an account of the unlikely connections that made up late nineteenth-century politics and culture. In particular, Benedict Anderson examines the links between militant anarchists in Europe and the Americas and the anti-imperialist uprisings in Cuba, China, and Japan. Told through the complex intellectual interactions of two great Filipino writersÃ¢â‚¬â€the political novelist JosÃƒÂ© Rizal and the pioneering folklorist Isabelo de los ReyesÃ¢â‚¬â€The Age of Globalization is a brilliantly original work on how global networks shaped the nationalist movements of the time.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;A curious yet riveting history Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ both exciting and important.&quot; -Guardian\n\n&quot;Fiercely, movingly local, concentrated on a handful of remarkable men and fateful years, but also expansively global.&quot; -T.J. Clark, London Review of Books\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
