Even if there were other galaxies with planets very similar to earth, life could only be there if the Creator had fashioned it. If God had done that, and if these beings were going to visit us one day, then He would surely not have left us unenlightened about this.\n\nGod has given us rather specific details of the futureÃ¢â‚¬â€for example, the return of Jesus, and some details about the end of the world. The universe will, at some future point, be rolled up like a scroll (Isaiah 34:4, Revelation 6:14). If God had created living beings elsewhere, this would automatically destroy their dwelling place as well. Adam's sin caused all of creation to be affected by the Curse, so why would a race of beings, not of Adam's (sinful) seed, have their part of creation affected by the Curse, and then be part of the restoration brought about by Christ, the last Adam? All of this would seem exceedingly strange.[1]\n\nSome have claimed that the nephilim, or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of God,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both mentioned in Genesis 6:2-4, were aliens. This is a wild extension of a common view that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who married the Ã¢â‚¬Å“daughters of menÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were fallen angels, and that the nephilim were products of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“marriages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is clearly used of angels in Job 38:7. The Septuagint (LXX) here translates Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Ã¢â‚¬Å“angels of God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This need not mean that evil angels, or demons, actually cohabited with womenÃ¢â‚¬â€Jesus made it clear that angels do not engage in sexual activities, at least not angels in heaven (Matthew 22:30). Nevertheless, evil angels on earth could have used the bodies of ungodly men, by demonic possession, to achieve their evil purpose of producing an evil generation of people (Genesis 6:12).[2]\n\nThere are other reasonable suggestions as to the identity of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Nephilim. Interestingly, the word nephilim is only used here and in Numbers 13:33, where it clearly refers to the descendants of Anak, who were big people, but still people. Furthermore, Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is not used exclusively of angelsÃ¢â‚¬â€the children of Israel are called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the sons of the living GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Hosea 1:10 (see also Psalm 73:15; 80:17).\n\nBible scholars such as H.C. Leupold believe that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were descendants of Seth, the godly line who are detailed in the preceding chapter (Genesis 4:25-5:32). Leupold wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But who were these Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsons of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢? Without a shadow of a doubt, the Sethites.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[3] In this view, the descendants of Seth became wayward and married the Ã¢â‚¬Å“daughters of menÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ indiscriminately, basing their choice only on appearance, without concern for godliness, and the nephilim were their offspring.\n\nEgyptian (photo copyrighted) (Courtesy of Films for Christ).Rulers in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia often proclaimed themselves as Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to enhance their power and prestige. So, another view with much support is that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were power-hungry rulers and despots, who, in their hunger for power and influence, took many wives in polygamy. They, and their offspring, through tyranny, became Ã¢â‚¬Å“mighty men.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Nimrod was described as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“mighty oneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Genesis 10:8.)\n\nSo, there is no need to resort to fanciful suggestions involving aliens to understand this passage of Scripture.\n\n\n\nThe Nephilim\n\n\nThe term &quot;Nephilim&quot; occurs just twice in the Hebrew Bible, both in the Torah. The first is Genesis 6:1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 NAS, immediately before the story of Noah's ark:\n\n  Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.&quot; The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\n\nThe second is Numbers 13:32Ã¢â‚¬â€œ33 NAS, where the Twelve Spies report that they have seen fearsome giants in Canaan:\n\n  So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, &quot;The land through which we had gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.\n\nThe nature of the nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis 6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the &quot;sons of God&quot; or their offspring who are the &quot;mighty men of old, men of renown&quot;. Richard Hess in The Anchor Bible Dictionary takes it to mean that the nephilim are the offspring,[11] as does P. W. Coxon in Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible.[12]\n\n\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 01 - The Real Truth - Noahs Ark DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 02 - The Real Truth - Noahs Ark DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 03 - The Real Truth - The Watcher Angels DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 04 - The Real Truth - The Watcher Angels DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 05 - The Real Truth - The Nephilim - Genesis 6 DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 06 - The Real Truth - The Nephilim - Genesis 6 DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 07 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 08 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 09 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 10 - The Real Truth -  Aliens - Fallen Angels - Demons - UFOs  DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 11 - The Real Truth - The Blood Moons and The Archon Invasion\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 12 - The Real Truth - The Nephilim Giants of Genesis  6 - The Aliens are Already Here\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 13 - The Real Truth - The Watchers - The Book of Enoch - DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 14 - The Real Truth - U F O s - Aliens - Fallen Angels - Nephilim - Whats The Connection\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 15 - The Real Truth - A T L A N T I S - Fallen Angel Technology and Genetic Abominations\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 16 - The Real Truth - A T L A N T I S - Fallen Angel Technology and Genetic Abominations\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 17 - The Real Truth - Did Giants or Angels Build Them - Mystery of The Pyramids DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 18 - The Real Truth - Did Giants or Angels Build Them - Mystery of The Pyramids DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 19 - The Real Truth - Did Giants or Angels Build Them - Mystery of The Pyramids DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 20 - The Real Truth - Did Giants or Angels Build Them - Mystery of The Pyramids DVD\nB I B L E - L I E S - Part 21 - The Real Truth - The Return of The Nephilim Giants Fallen Angels Demons - DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7cf5225414ffb19fe73b6f8a34c4091caa9b824","amp;dn":"B+I+B+L+E+-+L+I+E+S+-+Part+05+-+The+Real+Truth+-+The+Nephilim+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7cf5225414ffb19fe73b6f8a34c4091caa9b824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,207,82,37,65,79,251,25,254,115,182,248,163,76,64,145,202,169,184,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
