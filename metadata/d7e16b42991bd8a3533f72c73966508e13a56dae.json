Marked from the start by curious coincidence, each boy is forced to make his own way in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€a world of dodgy deals and big business, of criminal gangs and crooked landlords, of newspaper magnates, backbiters, and petty thieves.\n\nLondon is the backdrop and the connecting fabric of these three lives, reinforcing Ackroyd's grand theme that place and history create, surround and engulf us. From bustling, cut-throat Fleet Street to hallowed London publishing houses, from the wealth and corruption of Chelsea to the smoky shadows of Limehouse and Hackney, this is an exploration of the city, peering down its streets, riding on its underground, and drinking in its pubs and clubs.\n\nEverything is possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€not only in the new freedom of the 1960s but also in London's timeless past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e16b42991bd8a3533f72c73966508e13a56dae","amp;dn":"Three+Brothers+-+Peter+Ackroyd.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e16b42991bd8a3533f72c73966508e13a56dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,225,107,66,153,27,216,163,83,63,114,199,57,102,80,142,19,165,109,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
