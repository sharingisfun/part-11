Those words donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t comfort Emily, because she was born Christopher and her insides know that her outsides are all wrong.\n\nThey say that it gets better, be who you are and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be fine. For Emily, telling her parents who she really is means a therapist who insists Christopher is normal and Emily is sick. Telling her girlfriend means lectures about how God doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make that kind of mistake.\n\nEmily desperately wants high school in her small Minnesota town to get better. She wants to be the woman she knows is inside, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not until a substitute therapist and a girl named Natalie come into her life that she believes she has a chance of actually Being Emily.\n\nA story for anyone who has ever felt that the inside and outside donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t match and no one else will understand...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Powerful and empowering, with an optimistic message that we all need more of in our lives. I'm thrilled to see this book is out in the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Kate Bornstein, author of &quot;Gender Outlaw&quot; and &quot;A Queer and Pleasant Danger&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8266d3033413b4caa5ec0097c23728cd034b7eb","amp;dn":"Being+Emily+%28Rachel+Gold%29+Retail+epub+mobi+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8266d3033413b4caa5ec0097c23728cd034b7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,38,109,48,51,65,59,76,170,94,192,9,124,35,114,140,208,52,183,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
