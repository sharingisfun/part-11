Elizabeth Taylor stars as Alexandre Del Lago, a fading, alcoholic, drug-dependent movie star. Mark Harmon co-stars as Chance Wayne, a shiftless would-be actor who romances Alexandre in hopes of getting a few producer's doors opened for him in Hollywood. Assuming that it'll be a simple task to unload Alexandre when he's through with her, Chance has not reckoned with the star's smothering ego. Chance must also contend with Tom Finley (Rip Torn), the fire-breathing political boss who is the father of Chance's hometown sweetheart (Cheryl Paris). The TV remake of Sweet Bird of Youth was first broadcast October 1, 1989.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098418/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098418/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nNicolas Roeg\n\n\n\tElizabeth Taylor\t... \tAlexandra Del Lago\n\n\tMark Harmon\t... \tChance Wayne\n\n\tValerie Perrine\t... \tMiss Lucy\n\n\tKevin Geer\t... \tTom Junior\n\n\tSeymour Cassel\t\t\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:31:36\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 496x384\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1519 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,33 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nHave a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year !\n=============================================\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87e04308c0798a1196a648f4c0ddf02f41dedd3","amp;dn":"Sweet+Bird+of+Youth+%281989%29+%28TV%29+Elizabeth+Taylor.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87e04308c0798a1196a648f4c0ddf02f41dedd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,126,4,48,140,7,152,161,25,106,100,143,76,13,223,2,244,29,237,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
