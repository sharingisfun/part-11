Walking in the Spirit (Bonus Track)\n\nRelease notes: 2006 issued fresh and thoroughly grown up album from the veteran rockers!. Heavily grooving, loudly rocking, emotionally bluesy and self-confident above all, the guys are still telling their Rock n Roll stories in songs like &quot;Midnite Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Angel Of My Dreams&quot; or &quot;Hangman&quot; like almost no one else is able to do. Produced by Dennis Ward (House of Lords, Pink Cream 69 etc). More than 30 years since the founding of the band Krokus have celebrated their ups and survived their downs. Limited edition digipak version.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a86601d29d2410f82ad85fd042a8ae1ea47253","amp;dn":"Krokus-Hellraiser-Ltd.Ed.-Digipak-2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a86601d29d2410f82ad85fd042a8ae1ea47253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,168,102,1,210,157,36,16,248,42,216,95,208,66,168,174,30,164,114,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
