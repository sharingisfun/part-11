There is another rip of this movie floating around but the audio is broken.\n\nPLOT:\n\nTom the Piper&amp;#039;s Son is about to marry Mary Quite Contrary. On the eve of their wedding, evil miser Barnaby hires two henchmen to drown Tom and steal Mary&amp;#039;s sheep, cared for by Little Bo Peep, thus depriving Mary and the children she lives with of their livelihood, forcing her to marry Barnaby. The sheep are stolen, but Gonzorgo and Roderigo, Barnaby&amp;#039;s henchmen, double-cross him by selling Tom to a band of gypsies instead, leaving Tom with the opportunity to escape and make his way with Mary, Bo-Peep, and other Mother Goose characters to Toyland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c37eef34080483d6080bf368c2a823b09c9cb5","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+Babes+in+Toyland+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c37eef34080483d6080bf368c2a823b09c9cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,195,126,239,52,8,4,131,214,8,11,243,104,194,168,35,176,156,156,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
