This film, featuring leading academics in fields such as climatology, oceanography, meteorology and biogeography, questions the science behind the accepted reasons for global warming and argues that other explanations ? including the effect of the sun?s radiation on the atmosphere ? are not being properly aired. It also asserts that the single-minded focus on reducing carbon emissions might have the unintended consequence of stifling development in the Third World, prolonging endemic poverty and disease.?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d99c84f0d1308279322885173954230c647495","amp;dn":"The+Great+Global+Warming+Swindle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d99c84f0d1308279322885173954230c647495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,217,156,132,240,209,48,130,121,50,40,133,23,57,84,35,12,100,116,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
