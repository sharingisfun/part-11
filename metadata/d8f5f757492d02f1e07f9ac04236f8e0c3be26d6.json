Rick Stein wants to find out.\r\n\r\n'We all love a Chinese - the sweet and the sour, the freshness, the crunchiness, the colours, the smell of five spice and soy. I'll be finding the pockets of traditional food still left in this city - the dishes that the Shanghainese long for away from home. I'm going to taste rich red braised pork, Chairman Mao's favourite, the city's cherished hairy crabs and mouthwatering dumplings, unique to Shanghai, so delicate they sag under the weight of the hot liquid inside and burst at the lightest touch. And I want to add a few more dishes to your Chinese repertoire. I'm going to share my favourite Shanghainese dishes from this trip. If, like me, you thought you knew Chinese food, you're in for a surprise.'\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 019 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 5s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 412 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f5f757492d02f1e07f9ac04236f8e0c3be26d6","amp;dn":"BBC+Rick+Stein%27s+Taste+of+Shanghai+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f5f757492d02f1e07f9ac04236f8e0c3be26d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,245,247,87,73,45,2,241,224,127,154,192,66,54,248,224,195,190,38,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
