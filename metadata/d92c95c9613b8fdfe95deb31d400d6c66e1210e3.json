While the book draws on sociology, psychiatry, and other related disciplines to explore the range of eating-related behaviors, its primary emphasis is on the psychology of eating, as viewed from a social, health, and clinical perspective. Topics addressed include the nature of a healthy diet, how we make choices around what to eat, dieting and body dissatisfaction, and the root causes and treatments of obesity, bulimia, and anorexia.\nWritten in a lively and accessible manner, The Psychology of Eating offers deep insights into why we eat and it is an invaluable source of information for lay readers and professionals alike who wish to broaden their understanding of eating-related behavior.\n\nTitle: The Psychology of Eating: From Healthy to Disordered Behavior\nAuthor: Jane Ogden\nPublisher: Wiley\nYear: 2010\nISBN: 1405191201\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
