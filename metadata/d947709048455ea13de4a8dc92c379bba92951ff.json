The plot centers on law and crime in a fictional underwater metropolis with the protagonist, Inspector Gill, trying to solve various, often Mafia-related, crimes while avoiding being seduced by the buxom Angel. The comic featured several marine species as its characters, while the plots and dialogue were reminiscent of film noir.\n\nIn this torrent...\n\nIssues 1a-6a Fishwrap Productions, 1985-1987\n\nFish Police Special, Comico, 1987\n\nIssues 5b, 7b and 8-17 Comico, 1988-1989\n\nIssues 18-26 Apple Comics, 1989-1991\n\nIssues 1c-6c Marvel Comics, 1992-1993\n\nIssues 1-6 of Fish Shticks, App Comics, 1992-1993\n\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Steven Moncuse for all publishers\n\nColors in the Comico issues by Tom Vincent, Matt Webb, Trishie Schutz\n\nAdditional Inking in the Apple Comics issues by Juanita van Koppenhagen\n\nColors in the Marvel issues by Tom Vincent\n\nColor for Fish Police Special by Tom Vincent\n\nFish Shticks Written by Steven Moncuse, Illustrated by Steve Hauk\n\nSome of the Comico issues feature new backup stories by people like Matt Howarth, Arthur Adams, Eric Shanower and more.

After 12 issues the title was picked up by Comico in 1987, which reprinted issues 1-4 in a trade titled Hairballs, followed by color reprints of the other 8 Fishwrap issues. After issue 17, Comico went bankrupt, but Fish Police was then acquired by Apple Press, which continued the numbering begun by Comico. Apple published the title until early 1991, stopping at number 26. In 1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993, Marvel Comics reprinted the first six issues of the original self-published series, this time in full color.\n\nApple also printed a six-issue spin-off, Fish Shticks, between 1992 and 1993. Written by Moncuse and drawn by Steve Hauk, this series was more gag-based than the original.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d947709048455ea13de4a8dc92c379bba92951ff","amp;dn":"The+Fish+Police+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d947709048455ea13de4a8dc92c379bba92951ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,71,112,144,72,69,94,161,61,228,168,220,146,195,121,187,169,41,81,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
