The Atlantic Soul Legends 20-CDs boxset gathers for the very first time 20 original albums recorded beetween 1959 and 1975, including Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and Solomon BurkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpieces, the classic Stax/Volt recordings by Booker T. &amp; The M.G.s, Rufus Thomas, Sam and Dave, Eddie Floyd and Ben E. King, Percy Sledge, Don Covay and Donny HathawayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary LPs.\n\nMore than a classic anthology, the Atlantic Soul Legends boxset sheds a new light on more than 200 cult recordings by relocating them in their original album configuration. The Atlantic Soul Legends boxset also includes several rare, deleted or unreleased albums on CD format such as Clarence Wheeler and The EnforcersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ What We Wanna (1971) and the masterful The Show Must Go On, Sam DeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-lost gem released in 1975, available on CD for the very first time.
