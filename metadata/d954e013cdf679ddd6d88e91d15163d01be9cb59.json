The first shot, which entered the right side of Gaye's chest, was fatal, having perforated his vital organs. Gaye was taken to the emergency room of the California Hospital Medical Center and was pronounced dead on arrival at 1:01 pm. Gaye died a day before turning 45. The gun with which Marvin Gaye, Sr. shot his son was given to him by Marvin as a Christmas present.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMarvin Gaye - Marvin Gaye In Concert (Live)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Marvin Gaye\nAlbum................: Marvin Gaye In Concert (Live) 1993\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 306kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
