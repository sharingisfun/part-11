Getz's grace and beauty of tone have rarely been as evident as they are on the 'Cool Velvet' tracks; ballads like 'The Thrill is Gone,' 'It Never Entered My Mind,' and 'Born to Be Blue' will leave no doubt in any listener's mind as to the level of his artistry. 'Early Autumn' and 'Round Midnight' get stunning renditions, and 'Whisper Not' picks up the pace ever so slightly, and the combination of Getz, vibraphone, and strings over the tune's catchy melody make for one of the most memorable moments in Stan's career. 'Voices' is another chance for Getz fans to indulge in his love of Bossa Nova; with the exception of a gorgeous, drowsily-swinging 'I Didn't Know What Time it Was,' every track gets a sensuous, Brazilian-influenced arrangement. What sets the project apart from others, however, is the inclusion of background singers; 'ooh's and 'aah's sing the parts that would more commonly be assigned to violins, and the idea works surprisingly well, providing a near-ethereal effect. The musical arrangements are simply perfect throughout, and the strongest work lies in the uptempo 'Nica's Dream' and the silky ballad 'Infinidad.' The end results simply cannot be beat: two albums, two distinct artistic approaches of a jazz legend, a top-notch remastering job, and extensive liner notes...all on one disc at a reasonable price. No fan of instrumental jazz could ask for more. ~ John Jones, Amazon.com\n\nTwo of tenor-saxophonist Stan Getz's lesser-known ( and least significant ) albums are combined on this single Verve CD. Just prior to recording his bossa-nova hits, Getz is backed by a string section arranged by Russ Garcia in 1960 on a variety of melodic standards ( the Cool Velvet portion of this disc ) while in 1966 he is joined by both a string section and a vocal choir arranged by Claus Ogerman. Some of the latter performances border on muzak. Although Getz's tone sounds as beautiful as ever, no fire is lit under his playing and his accompaniment is difficult to sit through. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nStan Getz ( Tenor Saxophone ) \nBlanchie Birdsong ( Harp ) - 1-10 \nDave Hildinger ( Vibraphone ) - 1-10 \nJan Johansson ( Piano ) - 1-10 \nFreddy Dutton ( Double Bass ) - 1-10 \nSperie Karas ( Drums ) - 1-10 \nRuss Garcia ( Arranger, Conductor ) - 1-10 \nHerbie Hancock ( Piano ) - 11-21 \nor Hank Jones ( Piano ) - 11-21 \nJim Hall ( Guitar ) - 11-21 \nRon Carter ( Double Bass ) - 11-21 \nArtie Butler ( Percussion ) - 11-21 \nBill Horwath ( Percussion ) - 11-21 \nBobby Rosengarden ( Percussion ) - 11-21 \nGrady Tate ( Drums ) - 11-21 \nClaus Ogerman ( Arranger, Conductor ) - 11-21 \nUnknown Strings \nUnknown Choir - 11-21 \n\nCool Velvet: 1-10 tracks, recorded March 1960 in Baden-Baden, West Germany\nVoices: 11-21 tracks, recorded December 2, 1966 at Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Yersey\n\nStan Getz - Cool Velvet &amp; Voices Tracks:\n01  The Thrill Is Gone ( Lew Brown/Ray Henderson ) 5:03 \n02  It Never Entered My Mind ( Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart ) 4:06 \n03  Early Autumn ( Ralph Burns/Woody Herman/Johnny Mercer ) 4:45 \n04  When I Go, I Go All The Way ( Russell Garcia ) 4:00 \n05  A New Town Is A Blue Town ( Richard Adler/Jerry Ross ) 2:42 \n06  'Round Midnight ( Thelonious Monk/Cootie Williams/Bernie Hanighen ) 3:07 \n07  Born To Be Blue ( Mel Torme/Robert Wells ) 3:53 \n08  Whisper Not ( Benny Golson ) 5:04 \n09  Good-Bye ( Gordon Jenkins ) 4:26 \n10  Nature Boy ( Eden Ahbez ) 3:02 \n11  Once ( Claus Ogerman/Guy Wood ) 2:50 \n12  I Didn't Know What Time It Was ( Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart ) 3:28 \n13  Nica's Dream ( Horace Silver ) 3:57 \n14  ( Little Rio ) Un Poco Rio ( Claus Ogerman ) 2:30 \n15  Keep Me In Your Heart ( Chiedilo A Chi Vuoi ) ( Giorgio Calabrese/Giancarlo Clonello/Sandy Crystal ) 4:01 \n16  Zigeuner Song ( Peter Kreuder/GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nther Schwenn ) 3:10 \n17  Barbara's Theme ( aka 'I Want To Live' ) ( Johnny Mandel ) 2:56 \n18  Where Flamingos Fly ( John Benson Brooks/Harold Courlander/Elthea Pearl Brooks ) 3:07 \n19  Midnight Samba ( Werner Bochmann/Martha Bergner/Sandy Crystal ) 2:13 \n20  Infinidad ( Stanley J.
