Page teased Rhapsody In Blue at the end of Halfway to the Moon. Free, Walls of the Cave, Bowie and YEM all contained Martian Monster quotes. Chalk Dust was unfinished. Toward the end of the YEM jam, Trey picked up his megaphone and began using the siren on it as he ran around the stage, eventually coming to Mike and holding it up to the bass. Mike then put his bass down and began playing his fight bell with drum sticks while Trey went and started drumming along with Fishman.  Eventually Mike and Page joined in, so that all four were playing on Fish's kit. Moma Dance was played for the first time ever as an encore.\n\n\n***Please Seed As Long As Possible To Help Others Out.
