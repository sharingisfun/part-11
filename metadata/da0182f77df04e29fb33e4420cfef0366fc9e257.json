When she was captured, tortured, and ultimately executed by the English, she was made a Catholic saint. Bergman's Joan is a strong and spiritual figure who proves her devotion to the Dauphin (Jose Ferrer), later to become the King of France. Joan is compelling as she wins an alliance with the Governor of Vaucouleurs and the courtiers at Chinon, leads her army in the Battle of Orleans, is betrayed by the Burgundians, and edicts that &quot;our strength is in our faith.&quot; \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040491/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040491/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nVictor Fleming\n\n\n        Ingrid Bergman\t ... \tJoan of Arc\n\tFrancis L.
