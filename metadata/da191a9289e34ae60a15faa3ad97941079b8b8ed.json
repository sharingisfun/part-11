The documents, historical works and essays offer an unprecedented, wide-ranging look at the man and his career as the United States' top intelligence official and one of its most important diplomats during a crucial decade of the Cold War. From mid-1966, when he became DCI, to late 1976, when he left Iran, Helms dealt directly with numerous events whose impact remains evident today and which are covered in the release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da191a9289e34ae60a15faa3ad97941079b8b8ed","amp;dn":"CIA+Richard+Helms+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da191a9289e34ae60a15faa3ad97941079b8b8ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,25,26,146,137,227,74,230,10,21,250,163,173,151,148,16,121,184,184,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
