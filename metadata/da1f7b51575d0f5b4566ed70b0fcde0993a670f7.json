From the earliest known performances in the small bars of Texas to the first sessions with Big Brother to her mesmerizing live shows, Janis never left behind her raw roots. She drew upon them to impel emotional performances as if by exposing her pain she gained power over her past and transformed it into a gift. In these newly sourced pearls, we can hear as never before the birth and fast burning flame of Janis Joplin. \n\nIncluded are outtakes and unreleased songs from the 1968 &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; studio sessions, demos for the 1969 Kozmic Blues album and vast improvements on all existing vintage (1962-65) live recordings. \nThe vintage recordings, in particular, are wonderful and although we had some of this material from the long out of print &quot;Janis&quot; movie soundtrack vinyl release, this collection has 39 (!) tracks recorded between 1962-65 including the ubiquitous &quot;Typewriter Tapes&quot; made by Jorma. The fourth CD unchains the urgent expression and lets it be heard in a complete Big Brother concert from 1967.\n\nSit down by your window, put this set on, and blow all your blues away.\n\n****************************************************\nJanis Joplin: Blow All My Blues Away 1962-1970\n****************************************************\n\nCD#1 (66:28) The Early Years 1962-63\n\nJohn Riley's Home, Austin, Texas 1962\n01.
