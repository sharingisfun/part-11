Master Poisoner, Ghoroob of Mashad, has so perfected his craft that it is considered an honor to die from his meals. These are stories of magic and wonder in which ordinary people endure astonishing extremes in a world of bloodshed and brotherhood, miracles and catastrophes.\n\nWith lyrical wit and profound simplicity, The Honey Thief reveals an Afghanistan of greater richness and humanity than is conveyed in newspaper headlines; an Afghanistan not of failure and despair, but of resilience and fulfillment.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Short Story/General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2215b09c58df5cfc7435e051be626a19db8a1b","amp;dn":"The+Honey+Thief+by+Najaf+Mazari","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2215b09c58df5cfc7435e051be626a19db8a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,34,21,176,156,88,223,92,252,116,53,224,81,190,98,106,25,219,138,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
