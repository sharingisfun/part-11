I hate 'em, but sometimes they're necessary. \n\nI previously uploaded issues 1-18.5, here we have...\n\n\nIssues 19-20 of 'The Acme Novelty Library'\n\nSelf-Published, Distributed by Drawn &amp; Quarterly, 2008 &amp; 2010\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Chris Ware\n\nIssue 19 continues the Rusty Brown story and contains a few short stories as well\n\nIssue 20 is one full-length Jordan Lint story, and it's a good one. Powerful storytelling. I just sat quietly when I was done, thinking back over what I had just read, and how wondering how much of it had actually happened to the author (if any.. or all?).
