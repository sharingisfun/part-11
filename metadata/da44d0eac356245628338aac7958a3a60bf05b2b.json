Its state-of-the-art cinematography creates an intimate sense of place and captures a world of wonder, transporting viewers to isolated, undisturbed corners of the globe so pure they remind us of how the ancient world once was.\n\n\nTasmania - Land of the Devils\nOff the southeast coast of Australia is the island refuge of Tasmania. Safe from the forces that have changed much of the Australian continent, Tasmania is an Eden of magnificent forests, snow-capped mountain ranges, giant waterfalls, wild rivers and pristine coastlines. Tasmania is also the home of the largest marsupial carnivore - the Tasmanian Devil. Voracious eaters with powerful jaws, they often leave behind only the jawbone of their prey. Some of the oldest trees on earth, Huon pines over 2,000 years old, and the tallest flowering tree, the Swamp Gum, share this unique island with wallabies, bettongs, quolis, tiger snakes and ground parrots. Off the coast, giant kelp forests and sponge gardens host the prehistoric handfish, king crab, sea dragons, red velvet fish and deep sea anglerfish, many of which are found nowhere else on earth.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 2050 KB/s\nAverage Quants:\n* I:16.50 to 17.50\n* P:17.50 to 18.50\n* B:19.00 to 20.00\nVideo Resolution 1 - 14: 640 x 464 (4:3)\nVideo Resolution 15 - 24: 688 x 368 (16:9)\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 24\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Planet Earth\n* Greatest Places\n* The Living Planet\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Living_Edens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da44d0eac356245628338aac7958a3a60bf05b2b","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+The+Living+Edens+19of24+Tasmania+DVB+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da44d0eac356245628338aac7958a3a60bf05b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,68,208,234,195,86,36,86,40,51,138,172,121,88,163,166,11,240,91,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
