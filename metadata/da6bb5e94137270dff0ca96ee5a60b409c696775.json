Formulas have been figured out. Fonts are in place. It's all ready to go. Just choose one of the 30 templates to use for home, work, and school and make it your own. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re starting with a blank sheet, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy, too. Spreadsheets are built on a flexible, free-form canvas. So you can move tables, charts, graphics, and text anywhere you want on the page. Effortlessly create formulas using an intuitive browser with more than 250 functions. Add interactive controls such as sliders, steppers, and checkboxes that let you play Ã¢â‚¬Å“what ifÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in real time. Scale your document with a drag of the mouse or trackpad to create the perfect printout using the interactive print view. You can even add photos, movies, and music to your spreadsheet with just a few clicks.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 2.2\n\nThis update includes the features listed below.
