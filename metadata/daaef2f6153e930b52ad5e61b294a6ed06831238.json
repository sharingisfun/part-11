Marilyn Monroe, Angie Dickinson,\nJuliet Prowse, and Shirley MacLaine were often referred to as the &quot;Rat Pack Mascots&quot;, a title\nwhich reportedly made these ladies feel like &quot;one of the boys&quot;. The post-Bogart version of the\ngroup was reportedly never called that name by any of its members ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they called it the\nSummit or the Clan. &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it\nremains the lasting name for the group.\n\nLawford was a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy, and the group played a role in\ncampaigning for him and the Democrats. Sinatra expected that he would be part of Kennedy's\ncircle after the election but was excluded, which in turn led to Peter Lawford's exclusion from\nthe group after 1962. Lawford's role in Robin and the Seven Hoods was given to Bing Crosby\nand spiced up with several songs. (It wasn't the first time Sinatra had treated a Rat Packer\nthat way; Davis's role in Never So Few was given to Steve McQueen when Sinatra and Davis\nhad a temporary falling-out.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n\n1.
