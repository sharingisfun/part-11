It is currently published 10 times each year by the Mathematical Association of America.\n\nThe American Mathematical Monthly is an expository journal intended for a wide audience of mathematicians, from undergraduate students to research professionals. Articles are chosen on the basis of their broad interest and reviewed and edited for quality of exposition as well as content. In this the American Mathematical Monthly fulfills a different role than typical mathematical research journals.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not a Mickey-mouse math magazine; it's a genuine journal with original and expository papers aimed at graduate and smart undergraduate math majors. Authors included in the text include the likes of Donald Knuth and Paul Halmos. There are nearly 1000 issues spanning the years 1894 to 1995. The collection is not complete, however -- please message me if you have any issues missing in this collection.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dafb71a16ad290480d41fdd83a4891155f0fc824","amp;dn":"American+Mathematical+Monthly+--+Large+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dafb71a16ad290480d41fdd83a4891155f0fc824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,251,113,161,106,210,144,72,13,65,253,216,58,72,145,21,95,15,200,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
