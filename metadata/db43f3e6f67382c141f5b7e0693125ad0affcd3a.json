He receives a welfare check for $150,000 due to a misplaced decimal point, and uses his new-found wealth to buy lavish gifts for his family. Lois is upset when she discovers his welfare application after receiving a new welfare check in the mail. Peter attempts to make her happy by dropping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII. Peter and Brian are arrested by security guards and prosecuted for welfare fraud. At the courthouse, Lois pleads with the judge not to imprison Peter.

Distraught, Peter resolves to steal the transmitter so he can have television in his house and convinces Meg to take the blame for the outage. The device is stolen by Stewie, who intends to use it to control the weather. Peter attaches a cardboard cutout in front of his face to pretend that the world is a television program. Meg, tired of public scorn, reveals the truth behind the cable outage; the citizens of Quahog threaten Peter with violence, but he is saved by Lois. Peter takes his family on recreational outings, but the family grows tired of the constant physical activity, prompting Peter to go on the outings with William Shatner.

Meanwhile, Stewie misinterprets the meaning of &quot;birthday&quot; and assumes that the same mysterious &quot;Man in White&quot; who delivered him as an infant will be returning to force him back into Lois' womb. Peter fails to put together a party in time for Stewie's birthday, and reroutes a circus parade into the Griffins' backyard. Peter gives Meg permission to go to a &quot;party&quot; at her friend's house, not realizing that it is a cult meeting where the members will commit mass suicide by drinking poisoned punch. Peter retrieves Meg before the cult members drink the punch. The cult leader notices that Meg did not drink; he puts on his white robe and goes to the Griffins' house. Stewie traps and kills the cult leader, thinking he is the &quot;Man in White&quot;.\n\nS01E04 - Mind Over Murder\nStewie has begun teething; Lois explains to him that the pain will pass with time, so he decides to build a time machine. Lois asks Peter to take Chris to a soccer game. At the game, Peter punches a pregnant woman, and is put under house arrest. Peter decides to open a bar in his basement so that his friends will come to visit. The bar becomes a hot spot and Lois becomes upset until she has the opportunity to sing at the bar.

Meanwhile, Lois meets the Griffin family's new neighbors, the Swansons. Peter is initially annoyed by Joe Swanson and has no interest in becoming his friend, but convinces Joe to play for the softball team once Lois mentions that he played baseball in college. Next morning at the game, Peter is surprised to learn that Joe is wheelchair-bound. Joe's experience helps the team win.

Although Chris dislikes scouts and prefers drawing, he fears telling Peter. When Peter finds out, he drives the family to the scout headquarters in Manhattan to get Chris readmitted.

Since each Native American receives a share of the casino profits, Peter pretends to be a Native American, and he is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage. Chris accompanies Peter to explain that he only likes drawing. Delirious from hunger, Peter begins talking to anthropomorphic trees and has a vision of his spiritual guide, the Fonz.
