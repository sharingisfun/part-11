No ship can traverse the void without them. Only linesmen can work with them. But only Ean Lambert hears their song. And everyone thinks heâ€™s crazyâ€¦\r\n\r\nMost slum kids never go far, certainly not becoming a level-ten linesman like Ean. Even if heâ€™s part of a small, and unethical, cartel, and the other linesmen disdain his self-taught methods, heâ€™s certified and working.\r\n\r\nThen a mysterious alien ship is discovered at the edges of the galaxy. Each of the major galactic powers is desperate to be the first to uncover the shipâ€™s secrets, but all theyâ€™ve learned is that it has the familiar lines of energyâ€”and a defense system that, once triggered, annihilates everything in a 200 kilometer radius.\r\n\r\nThe vessel threatens any linesman who dares to approach it, except Ean. His unique talents may be the key to understanding this alarming new forceâ€”and reconfiguring the relationship between humans and the ships that serve them, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Brian Hutchison\r\nLength: 12 hrs and 41 mins\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:06-30-15\r\nPublisher: Recorded Books\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nAlliance (Linesman #2)\r\n\r\nAs the Linesman series continues, linesman Ean Lambert finds himself facing an alien ship he doesnâ€™t understandâ€”and a terrifying political threat he cannot fightâ€¦\r\n\r\nThe lines. The soul of every ship. It was once thought there were only ten, but that was before an alien vessel appeared at the edge of spaceâ€”before Ean Lambert heard more lines singing. Eanâ€™s ways of communicating with lines is strange. But his abilities make him a valuable toolâ€”or weaponâ€”to command.\r\n\r\nCaptain Selma Kari Wang has lost everythingâ€”her ship, her crew, her legs. But the New Alliance of Worlds is not done with her yet. After they rebuild her broken body, they send her to captain one of the new alien ships, teaming her up with Ean, the only one who can understand the alien lines.\r\n\r\nKari Wang and Ean are poised on the threshold of discoveries that could change the world. But not everyone wants the New Alliance to control the secrets they uncoverâ€”and those who oppose wonâ€™t hesitate to do whatever it takes to stop themâ€¦\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Brian Hutchinson\r\nLength: 13 hrs and 17 mins\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:02-25-16\r\nPublisher: Recorded Books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db43f6ed370dc11806da431808ba495f1dade7be","amp;dn":"S.K.+Dunstall+-+Linesman+and+Alliance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db43f6ed370dc11806da431808ba495f1dade7be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,67,246,237,55,13,193,24,6,218,67,24,8,186,73,95,29,173,231,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
