As such it lacks real insight into human potential and its\nproper rule through judicious use of power that is motivated by the greatest\nidealism rather than the expediencies of what is the status quo - fraught\nwith inadequacies as has generally always been so.\n\nMen must be taught what is right rather than what has generally worked well\nenough to keep them going. That is the ultimate failing in his message\n(see title of chapter 16 in particular)and of many others that continue to\nthink this way today everywhere we look on the world stage.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n3CD converted from 256k source to clear crisp 80k vocal bitrate  as the\ncontent is all reading from a text so no loss of any quality is Germain or\nreally perceptible - however the savings in bandwidth are a necessity in such\na clear case of wiser decisions.\n\nChapter 1 - Types of territories\nA very short chapter that names the types of territories ruled by\na prince and how he acquires them.\n\nChapter 2 - Hereditary states\nDescribes the ease and difficulties of holding hereditary states\n\nChapter 3 - Mixed principalities\nDescribes how new mixed principalities (principalities that are members of\na state) are to be taken and held.\n\nChapter 4 - Governing principalities\nContrasts the benefits and drawbacks of governing principalities using either\nservants or barons.\n\nChapter 5 - Free principalities\nSuggests three ways to govern cities and principalities that were used to live\nunder their own laws.\n\nChapter 6 - New principalities\nDescribe how to acquire new principalities using armies or your own abilities.\n\nChapter 7 - Armies of others\nExplains the dangers of using the armies of others or good fortune to get and\nkeep principalities.\n\nChapter 8 - Be wicked!
