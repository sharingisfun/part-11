Only this time, Lisbeth must return to the\ndarkness of her own past (more specifically, an event coldly\nknown as &quot;All the Evil&quot;) if she is to stay one step ahead--and\nalive. The Girl Who Played with Fire is a break-out-in-a-cold-\nsweat thriller that crackles with stunning twists and dismisses\nany talk of a sophomore slump. Fans of Larsson's prior work\nwill find even more to love here, and readers who do not find\ntheir hearts racing within the first five pages may want to\nconfirm they still have a pulse. Expect healthy doses of\nmurder, betrayal, and deceit, as well as enough espresso\ndrinks to fuel downtown Seattle for months.\nSeed Please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8951f209414588765c8862c1069a6e0cd90d38","amp;dn":"The+Girl+Who+Played+With+Fire+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8951f209414588765c8862c1069a6e0cd90d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,137,81,242,9,65,69,136,118,92,136,98,193,6,154,110,12,217,13,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
