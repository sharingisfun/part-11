Rarities, B-Sides &amp; Other Stuff, Vol. 2 led the pack in April, followed by a deluxe edition of Fumbling Toward Ecstasy several months later. Closer: The Best of Sarah McLachlan brought up the rear, arriving in October and compiling McLachlan's greatest hits along with two new songs. &quot;Don't Give Up on Us&quot; and &quot;U Want Me 2&quot; are standard McLachlan tunes, mixing adult contemporary songcraft with the soothing, evergreen vocals that helped her rise to prominence. As always, producer Pierre Marchand helms both of those new songs, and his presence throughout this compilation -- not to mention McLachlan's steady songcraft -- helps make Closer a consistent, unified work. Casual fans will find what they need in the regular 16-track version, while diehards might want to look at the two-disc version, which includes additional songs and several remixes. -  Review by Andrew Leahey  \n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Vox\n[02] The Path Of Thorns (Terms)\n[03] Into The Fire\n[04] Possession\n[05] Hold On\n[06] Good Enough\n[07] Building A Mystery\n[08] Sweet Surrender\n[09] Adia\n[10] Angel\n[11] I Will Remember You\n[12] Fallen\n[13] Stupid\n[14] World On Fire\n[15] Don't Give Up On Us\n[16] U Want Me 2\n[17] Silence (Niels Van Gogh Vs Thomas Gold Remix Radio Edit) - Delerium Featuring Sarah McLachlan\n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:11m:13s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 171mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
