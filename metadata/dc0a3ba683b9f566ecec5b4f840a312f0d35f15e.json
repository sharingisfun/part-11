Proving the existence of a viable market for &quot;small&quot; films that are also intellectually rewarding, their work has exploded generic conventions amid rich webs of trans-textural references. In Joel and Ethan Coen, R. Barton Palmer argues that the Coen oeuvre also forms a central element in what might be called postmodernist filmmaking. Mixing high and low cultural sources and blurring genres like noir and comedy, the use of pastiche and anti-realist elements in films such as The Hudsucker Proxy and Barton Fink clearly fit the postmodernist paradigm. Palmer argues that for a full understanding of the Coen brothers unique position within film culture, it is important to see how they have developed a new type of text within general postmodernist practice that Palmer terms commercial/independent. Analyzing their substantial body of work from this &quot;generic&quot; framework is the central focus on this book.\n\nPublisher: University of Illinois Press (June 18, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0252071859\nISBN-13: 978-0252071850","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0a3ba683b9f566ecec5b4f840a312f0d35f15e","amp;dn":"Joel+and+Ethan+Coen+%28Contemporary+Film+Directors%29%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0a3ba683b9f566ecec5b4f840a312f0d35f15e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,10,59,166,131,185,245,102,236,236,91,79,132,10,49,47,13,53,241,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
