Tougher and more durable than their rigid counterparts, these inflatable modules are perfectly suited for use in the space, where Bigelow plans to link them together to form commercial space stations. This book describes how this new breed of space stations will be built and how the link between Bigelow Aerospace, NASA and private companies can lead to a new economyÃ¢â‚¬â€a space economy. Finally, the book touches on Bigelow's aspirations beyond low Earth orbit, plans that include the landing of a base on the lunar surface and the prospect of missions to Mars.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (13 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319051962\nISBN-13: 978-3319051963","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1608f9b18dd59361adbe9db484c82a35dc9993","amp;dn":"Bigelow+Aerospace+Colonizing+Space+One+Module+at+a+Time%28pdf%29%7BZzz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1608f9b18dd59361adbe9db484c82a35dc9993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,22,8,249,177,141,213,147,97,173,190,157,180,132,200,42,53,220,153,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
