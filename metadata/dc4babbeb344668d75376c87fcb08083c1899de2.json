Since 1993, Chesney has recorded thirteen albums, eleven of which have been certified gold or higher by the RIAA. He has also produced more than thirty Top Ten singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, fifteen of which reached Number One. In addition, Chesney has received six ACM (including four consecutive Entertainer of the Year Awards),  as well as six CMA awards. Chesney is also one of the most popular touring acts in country music, regularly selling out the venues at which he performs; his 2007 Flip-Flop Summer Tour was the highest-grossing country road trip of 2007.  He was awarded his 4th consecutive ACM Entertainer of the Year award on May 18, 2008.\n\nMe And You is the third album released by country music singer Kenny Chesney. It was released in 1996. Although its lead-off single &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; failed to make Top 40, the album's title track and &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot; both reached #2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in 1996. The title track was reprised from Chesney's previous album. &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; is a cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single from his album Simple Life, while &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot; was previously recorded by Restless Heart lead singer Larry Stewart on his 1993 debut album Down the Road.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4babbeb344668d75376c87fcb08083c1899de2","amp;dn":"Kenny+Chesney+Me+and+You+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4babbeb344668d75376c87fcb08083c1899de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,75,171,190,179,68,102,141,117,55,108,135,252,176,128,131,193,137,157,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
