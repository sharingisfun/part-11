Influence of stress on natural killer (NK) cells.\n2. Poorer repair of damaged DNA.\n3. Modulation of apoptosis.\n4. Oxidative stress: aggravated by\npsychological stress\nStress and natural killer cells\nNK cells are the surveillance cells of immune\nsystem, capable of destroying tumor cells and infected\ncells. Stressors have been demonstrated to decrease\nlymphocyte proliferation and reduce NK cell\ncytotoxicity(1). Also, the cytokines- interferon ? and\ninterleukin -2 (IL-2) which otherwise enhance NK cells\nand lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cell activity get\nsuppressed due to stress(2). Smoking may play a\nsynergistic role (in conjunction with psychological\nfactors) and may further reduce NK cell cytotoxicity.\nSuppression of NK cells and its functions may lead to\nonset and/or progression of cancer.\nStress and DNA repair\nCarcinogens induce tumors by damaging cellular\nDNA(3). BodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defense processes repair this damage\nso as to prevent the occurrence of cancer. Ability to\nrepair damaged DNA, however is impaired in those\nwith depression(4). Some of the animal studies have\nalso suggested that stress may alter the DNA repair\nprocesses(5). Thus, inability to repair DNA damage may\nlead to cancer.\nStress modulates apoptosis\nApoptosis is a genetically programmed process,\nwhich leads to alteration in cell structure and eventual\nsuicide. This process helps elimination of damaged\ncells, which would otherwise induce carcinogenesis;\nstress, however, impairs this process(6).\nOxidative stress: aggravated by psychosocial stress\nThough oxygen is the most critical nutrient of\nlife, it is also the source of free radicals or reactive\noxygen species (ROS). ROS are generated either during\nthe normal metabolic processes of the body or due to\nexternal agents such as radiation, ultraviolet light,\ncigarette smoke, and environmental pollutants such\nas asbestos, pesticides etc(7,8). ROS provide a state\ncalled as oxidative stress, which is aggravated by\npsychosocial stress(9), and leads to many diseases\nincluding atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease\n(CHD), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.\nAn antioxidant is a substance that scavenges\nROS. The body is equipped with antioxidant defense\nin the form of glutathione and antioxidant enzymes\nsuch as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and\nglutathione peroxidase. Balance between the levels of\nROS and antioxidant defense in the body would\ndetermine as to whether a person remains healthy or\nsuffers from one of the chronic diseases including\ncancer, as mentioned above.\nFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that\npsychologic stress could induce cancer and/or may\ncause its progression through a variety of mechanisms\nincluding suppression of immune system, faulty repair\nof DNA, modulation of apoptosis and through\naggravation of oxidative stress.\nBehavioral interventions\nBehavioral interventions in the form of\nrelaxation techniques have been studied to see if these\ncould improve immune functions and/or antioxidant\ndefense and may have positive effects on patients\nsuffering from cancer. NK cell activity has been\ndemonstrated to increase by many researchers(10, 11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc73dffd1bc5e7af2489d2cd5ffbb6ac42c95cb0","amp;dn":"Sudarshan+Kriya+-+Sri+Sri+Ravi+Shankar+-CANCER+TREATMENT.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc73dffd1bc5e7af2489d2cd5ffbb6ac42c95cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,115,223,253,27,197,231,175,36,137,210,205,95,251,182,172,66,201,92,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
