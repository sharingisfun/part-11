The book is structured as a logical progression through acoustic interactions. Beginning with an architectural history, it reviews the fundamentals of acoustics, human perception and reaction to sound, acoustic noise measurements and noise metrics, and environmental noise. It then moves into wave acoustics, sound and solid surfaces, sound in enclosed spaces, sound transmission loss, sound transmission in buildings, vibration and vibration isolation, noise transmission in floor systems, noise in mechanical systems, and sound attenuation in ducts.\nChapters on specific design problems follow including treatment of multifamily dwellings, office buildings, rooms for speech, sound reinforcement systems, rooms for music, multipurpose rooms, auditoriums, sanctuaries, and studios and listening rooms. While providing a thorough overview of acoustics, it also includes the theory of loudspeaker systems and sound system modeling as well as an in-depth presentation of computer modeling, ray tracing and auralization. It will be particularly beneficial for architects and engineers working in fields where speech intelligibility, music appreciation, and noise isolation are critical.\n* Comprehensive guide to the basics of acoustical science and its applications to architectural design.\n* Author is renowned expert engaged in acoustical engineering for 20 years\n* Covers the latest environmental regulations and health and safety research related to sound inside and outside of buildings.\n\nReview\n&quot;A very comprehensive compendium of information that would be a valuable resource for an acoustical consultant. For me the major feature of Architectural Acoustics is the comprehensive range of useful information compiled into one book. The book is a valuable new contribution and seems to be a bargain for the immense amount of material it includes.&quot; - John Bradley, Institute for Research in Construction, Journal Acoustical Society America, July 2006 &quot;Marshall Long's new book is a welcome addition to the general acoustical iterations as well as to the desktop reference collection of practicing acousticians. It is voluminous, full of clear figures, and written in a rigorous but comfortable style. Long is an established consultant in Los Angeles with a thirty year plus practice in most aspects of architectural and structural acoustics. In this book he literally pours forth the broad extent and depth of his knowledge.&quot; - John Eargle, J. Audio Eng. Soc., Vol 54, No. 7/8. 2006 July/August &quot;This is one of those useful 'compilation' books which collate information from many other texts, resulting in the typical response to a design office query: &quot;It's probably in Marshall Long.&quot; This will be a very useful reference book by industry practitioners and a readable and informative student text. Its main value is painstakingly bringing together much useful data and knowledge from a multitude of reputable sources.&quot; - Journal of Sound and Vibration, 22 December 2006","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca5392f68fe7b3b22bec4686fdd17da106afc81","amp;dn":"Architectural+Acoustics+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca5392f68fe7b3b22bec4686fdd17da106afc81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,165,57,47,104,254,123,59,34,190,196,104,111,221,23,218,16,106,252,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
