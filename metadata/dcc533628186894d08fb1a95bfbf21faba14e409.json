Using long-buried archival material and a wealth of newly translated documents, Madden has weaves a spellbinding story of a place and its people, tracing an arc from the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humble origins as a lagoon refuge to its apex as a vast maritime empire and Renaissance epicenter to its rebirth as a modern tourist hub.\n\nMadden explores all aspects of VeniceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breathtaking achievements: the construction of its unparalleled navy, its role as an economic powerhouse and birthplace of capitalism, its popularization of opera, the stunning architecture of its watery environs, and more. He sets these in the context of the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire, the endless waves of Crusades to the Holy Land, and the awesome power of Turkish sultans. And perhaps most critically, Madden corrects the stereotype of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money-lending Shylock that has distorted the Venetian character, uncovering instead a much more complex and fascinating story, peopled by men and women whose ingenuity and deep faith profoundly altered the course of civilization.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc533628186894d08fb1a95bfbf21faba14e409","amp;dn":"Venice+-+A+New+History+-+Thomas+F.+Madden.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc533628186894d08fb1a95bfbf21faba14e409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,197,51,98,129,134,137,77,8,251,26,149,191,191,33,250,186,20,228,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
