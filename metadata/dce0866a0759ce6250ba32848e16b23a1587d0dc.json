Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria (1837Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1901), called the Victorian era, during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed &quot;Victorian&quot; architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign. The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles mixed with the introduction of middle east and Asian influences. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it follows Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture, and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce0866a0759ce6250ba32848e16b23a1587d0dc","amp;dn":"Victorian+Architecture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce0866a0759ce6250ba32848e16b23a1587d0dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,224,134,106,7,89,206,98,80,186,50,132,142,22,178,58,21,135,208,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
