While her social life is almost non existent, she does have one skill: while wearing shapewear and with her reading glasses perched on her nose, she can out-research the best of them, especially when her caffeine levels are high. When sent to England to write articles about alchemists of the past, Misty has no sooner arrived than she finds the body of her elderly Aunt, and at once inherits her Aunt's feisty cat, Diva. Misty is suddenly drawn into a web of intrigue, secret societies, and the mystical. What secret of her aunt's gave someone a motive for murder? As time runs out, Misty races to put the pieces together before she becomes the next victim.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Reason for Murder.

Morpeth, once an early river port of Australia but now famous for its ghosts, plays host to Misty's latest mystery. Misty Sales, journalist for a paranormal magazine, is back from London, having been made Keeper of a Society about which she knows nothing. Her caffeine habit is out of control, as is her job security, and her cat, Diva, is more unpredictable than ever. Even Misty's life is left in the balance, as her Editor sends her to write about the ghosts of Morpeth. In danger, in shapewear, and in debt, Misty matches wits against an unseen enemy. He attacks Misty with natural and unnatural means, while Misty hits back hard with facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Basis for Murder.
