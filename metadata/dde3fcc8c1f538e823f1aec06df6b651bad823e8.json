It\nhas a small amount of white noise mixed in to the final render to get rid of\nthose awkward silences that the MP3 format sometimes creates when there's not\nenough volume to compress. Talk Radio &amp; Podcasts sound much better, especially\nthru earbuds, with this edit. You will also find it easier to hear audio details\nin loud environments. If you have good speakers, or listen in a quite\nenvironment, you don't need this. This encode should also use considerable less\npower from your batteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde3fcc8c1f538e823f1aec06df6b651bad823e8","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+February+18%2C+2015+%5BALL-VERSIONS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde3fcc8c1f538e823f1aec06df6b651bad823e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,227,252,200,193,245,56,232,35,241,174,192,109,246,182,81,186,216,35,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
