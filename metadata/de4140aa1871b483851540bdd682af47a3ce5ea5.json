It was released just a few days ago, on June 15th, 2011, so many many thanks to the original uploader!\n \nEnjoy and seed!\n\n\nFrom Amazon.com\n\nThe Ibis, loaded to its gunwales with a cargo of indentured servants, is in the grip of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal; among the dozens flailing for survival are Neel, the pampered raja who has been convicted of embezzlement; Paulette, the French orphan masquerading as a deck hand; and Deeti, the widowed poppy grower fleeing her homeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­land with her lover, Kalua. The storm also threatens the clipper ship Anahita, groaning with the largest consignment of opium ever to leave India for Canton. And the Redruth, a nursery ship, carries ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFitcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Penrose, a horticulturist determined to track down the priceless treasures of China that are hidden in plain sight: plants that have the power to heal, or beautify, or intoxicate. All will converge in CantonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fanqui-Town, or ForÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­eign Enclave: a tumultuous world unto itÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­self where civilizations clash and sometimes fuse. It is a powder keg awaiting a spark to ignite the Opium Wars.\n\nSpectacular coincidences, startling reÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­versals of fortune, and tender love stories abound. But this is much more than an irresistible page-turner. The blind quest for money, the primacy of the drug trade, the concealment of base impulses behind the rhetoric of freedom: in River of Smoke the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries meet, and the result is a consuming historical novel with powerful contemporary resoÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­nance. Critics praised Sea of Poppies for its vibrant storytelling, antic humor, and rich narrative scope; now Amitav Ghosh conÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­tinues the epic that has charmed and comÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­pelled readers all over the globe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4140aa1871b483851540bdd682af47a3ce5ea5","amp;dn":"Amitav+Ghosh+--+Ibis+Trilogy+Part+2+--+River+of+Smoke+multiple+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4140aa1871b483851540bdd682af47a3ce5ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,65,64,170,24,113,180,131,133,21,64,189,214,130,175,71,163,206,94,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
