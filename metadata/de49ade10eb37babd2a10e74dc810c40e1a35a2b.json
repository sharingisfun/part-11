I have seen most versions.\n\nEnclosed are the closed captions in a text file for whomever has the time and\nability to create subtitles for this movie. This sort of thing used to be my\nspeciality, but I'm tired of the tedium. I would guess it would take two weeks at two hours a day to get the job done.\n\nThe subtitle files supplied, at first glance, seem to me to be about the same as my closed caption ones. Only one fourth of the movies seems supplied with proper subtitles.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de49ade10eb37babd2a10e74dc810c40e1a35a2b","amp;dn":"Jane+Eyre+%282006%29+BBC+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de49ade10eb37babd2a10e74dc810c40e1a35a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,73,173,225,14,179,123,171,210,161,14,116,220,129,12,64,225,163,90,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
