(Qaushiq Mukherjee) who has described the film as a &quot;rap musical&quot;.[2] It features Anubrata, Joyraj, Kamalika, Shilajit, and Rii in the main roles. The film's music is by the alternative rock band Five Little Indians.[3] Gandu previewed at Yale University before making its international premiere on October 29, 2010 at the 2010 South Asian International Film Festival in New York City.[2] Gandu was an official selection at the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival and was also screened at the Slamdance Film Festival.[4]\nGandu has received mainly positive reviews from critics. John Reiss called it &quot;a stunning visual and narrative feast&quot;[5] while Variety said it is &quot;a happily transgressive rhyme-fueled romp&quot;.[1] The film has caused some controversy because of language and scenes of full frontal sex. Media outlets have reported audience walkouts during sex scenes[6] and it has not been publicly released in India.\n\n[IMG]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/8400/30bmoviereel1.png[/IMG]\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nFrustrated with his life in a poor Kolkata neighborhood, aspiring rapper Gandu steals money from his mother to finance a trip with his friend Ricksha.
