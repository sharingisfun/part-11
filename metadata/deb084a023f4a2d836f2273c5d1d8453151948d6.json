Black is best known as the leader of the influential alternative rock band Pixies, performing under the stage name Black Francis. Following the band&amp;#039;s breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under his current pseudonym. After releasing several albums with 4AD, he left the label and formed a backing band, Frank Black and the Catholics. Black reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records whilst touring and recording with them.\n\nBlack&amp;#039;s vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodical style in later Pixies albums and solo career. Black&amp;#039;s cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and Biblical violence, along with dam collapses, science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud-quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in his career as a solo artist give him a unique style in alternative rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb084a023f4a2d836f2273c5d1d8453151948d6","amp;dn":"Frank+Black+-+2+Albums+%284AD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb084a023f4a2d836f2273c5d1d8453151948d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,176,132,160,35,244,162,216,54,242,39,60,93,29,132,83,21,25,72,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
