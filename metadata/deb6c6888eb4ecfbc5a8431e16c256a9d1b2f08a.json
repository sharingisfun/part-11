Kaufman play, Stage Door is a comedic portrait of the theatrical community in New York. Katharine Hepburn stars as Terry Randall a young woman who comes from a wealthy, socially connected family. Aspiring for a career on the stage, Terry opts to see if she can make it on her own gumption and moves into a boarding house with several other wannabe Broadway starlets attempting to make a mark for themselves in show business. Terry's sassy roommate Jean (Ginger Rogers) just might get the opportunity to do that when she meets a lecherous producer, but at what cost? Unamused by Terry's attempts to pull herself up by her bootstraps, her father offers her an opportunity for a starring role in a show that's sure to fail. Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, and Ann Miller are among the other residents of the boarding house. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029604/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029604/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-9436&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-9436&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nGregory La Cava\n\n        Katharine Hepburn\t ... \tTerry Randall\n\n\tGinger Rogers\t... \tJean Maitland\n\n\tAdolphe Menjou\t... \tAnthony Powell\n\tGail Patrick\t... \tLinda Shaw\n\tConstance Collier\t... \tMiss Luther\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:03\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x400\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1037 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 32000 Hz\nBitRate : 80 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb6c6888eb4ecfbc5a8431e16c256a9d1b2f08a","amp;dn":"Stage+Door+%281937%29+Katharine+Hepburn+%28Dual%29+Eng+%26+Span.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb6c6888eb4ecfbc5a8431e16c256a9d1b2f08a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,182,198,136,142,180,236,251,197,168,67,30,22,194,86,169,209,178,240,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
