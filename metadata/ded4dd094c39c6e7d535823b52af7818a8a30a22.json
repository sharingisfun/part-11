I've noticed there's Dogz and Catz 5 for torrent, but no 4 or Babyz so I'm going to upload those, sindce I think these great games need to be shared.\nNo serial code or anything. Just mount or burn the iso and the setup should come up in the autorun. Install the additional things if you want to speak to your petz through a microphone. Works on my Win7 setup if you run as administrator, will probably do the same on Vista. Definitely on XP and previous OS's.\n\nAdd-ons:\nPetzA - http://www.sherlocksoftware.org/page.php?id=6. Hax.\n\nEnjoy guys!\n\n~ Raven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded4dd094c39c6e7d535823b52af7818a8a30a22","amp;dn":"Dogz+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded4dd094c39c6e7d535823b52af7818a8a30a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,212,221,9,76,57,198,231,213,53,130,59,82,175,120,24,168,163,10,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
