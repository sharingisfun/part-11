Voila! C-A-G-E-D!\nRHYTHM GUITAR AND CHORD PROGRESSIONS\nKnowing these different chord positions will allow you to be more flexible and create many different voicings, rather than just playing the same group of chords. Take a simple 2-chord progression, like G to C. You can then easily spice things up by moving to higher or lower chord positionsÃ¢â‚¬â€ yet you are still playing the same 2 chords, G to C. It's as simple as that.\nLEAD GUITAR\nFor each chord position, you will also learn scale positions, which you can use to create lead fills as well as lead guitar solos.\nBy the end of this course you will have CAGED major, minor and 7th chords, along with major and minor pentatonic and diatonic scales. In other words, you will have a very thorough understanding of the entire fretboard!\nBONUS FEATURES: Easy-to-read, on-screen sheet music. Printable PDFs of the MJS CAGED Method in every key! Includes &quot;EASY CHEAT&quot; chords for beginners!\nRead more at http://www.heroturko.me/ebooks/2861791-mjs-easy-caged-guitar-fretboard-mastery-of-chords-and-scales-on-the-entire-neck-dvd-2011.html#mICFV1MomFhHcpci.99\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfba766176167be3cce6acfe48f342561a0f17a0","amp;dn":"MJS+-+Easy+Caged+Guitar+-+Fretboard+Mastery+of+Chords+and+Scales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfba766176167be3cce6acfe48f342561a0f17a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,186,118,97,118,22,123,227,204,230,172,254,72,243,66,86,26,15,23,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
