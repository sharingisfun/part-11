It brought about the air strike of Libya that President Reagan had promised-a strike that had three important consequences. First, it derailed a deal for the release of the American hostages in Lebanon, thus preserving the Hizballah (party of God) as the number one enemy in the eyes of the West. Second, it sent a message to the entire Arab world, telling them exactly where the United States stood regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict. Third, it boosted the Mossad's image of itself, since it was they who, by ingenious sleight of hand, had prodded the United States to do what was right.&quot; \nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 116\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the end of March, the Americans were already intercepting messages broadcast by the Trojan, which  was only activated during heavy communication traffic hours. Using the Trojan, the Mossad tried to make it appear that a long series of terrorist orders were being transmitted to various Libyan embassies  around the world (or, as they were called by the Libyans, PeoplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bureaus). As the Mossad had hoped, the transmissions were deciphered by the Americans and construed as ample proof that the Libyans were active sponsors of terrorism. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, the Americans pointed out, Mossad reports confirmed it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 115\n\nMossad Creates and Controls Islamic Extremist Groups and Uses Them As Patsies\n&quot;Supporting the radical elements of Muslim fundamentalism sat well witht he Mossad's general plan for the region. An Arab world run by fundamentalists would not be a party to any negotiations with the West, thus leaving Israel again as the only democratic, rational country in the region. And if the Mossad could arrange for the Hamas (Palestinian fundamentalists) to take over the Palestinian streets from the PLO, then the picture would be complete.&quot;\nVictor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception - pg. 197\n\nMossad Tests Chemical Weapons on Civilians\n&quot;It was Uri who enlightened me regarding the Nes Ziyyona facility. It was, he said, an ABC warfare laboratory-ABC standing for atomic, bacteriological, and chemical. It was where our top epidemiological scientists were developing various doomsday machines. Because we were so vulnerable and would not have a second chance should there be an all-out war in which this type of weapon wouldbe needed [Sampson Option], there was no room for error. The Palestinian infiltrators came in handy in this regard. As human guinea pigs, they could make sure the weapons the scientists were developing worked properly and could verify how fast they worked and make them even more efficient.&quot;\nVictor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception - pg. 188\n\nMossad Frames People as Nazis to Discredit Them\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRan had realized at some point in mid-1987 that trouble was on the horizon. There was growing dissatisfaction in the Mossad and in the right-wing elements of the Israeli government regarding the behaviour of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was defying direct Israeli warnings regarding his relationship with the Austrian leader Kurt Waldheim, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been branded a Nazi. (The branding was done by a field unity of Al that entered a UN building on Park Avenue South in New York and placed several incriminating documents that had been removed from other files into WaldheimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s file and the files of a few other individuals-for future use. The falsified documents were thenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½discoveredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ambassador to the UN, Benjamin Netanyhu, as part of a smear campaign against Waldheim, who was critical of Israeli activities in southern Lebanon.) [Uwe Barschel was assassinated later by Mossad]\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 228-229 \n\nMossad Control International Media\n&quot;He then wanted to hear as much as I could tell him about Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper magnate. His reason was that they were aware of the constant Mossad interest in purchasing media so that it could both influence public opinion and use journalism as a cover for inserting agents into countries.\n\n&quot;He identified Maxwell as a Mossad agent and also reminded me of other occasions on which the Mossad had been behind the purchase of newspapers in England. As an example, he gave the Eastern African, which was bought with Mossad money by an Israeli businessman. The purchase was made, he said, to assist the South African propaganda machine in making apartheid more palatable in the West....Maxwell was a sayan on a grand scale.&quot;\npage 203\n\n&quot;I explained to my host, as I had to the British, that in the beginning the Mossad would help Maxwell purchase the newspapers by lending him money and causing labour disputes and other problems, making the target purchases more vulnerable. Later, the tactics changed; they would target in advance a paper that he was to purchase and start it on a collision course with bankruptcy using all available strategies, starting with workforce agitation and ending with pullback of funds from the paper through bankers and advertisers sympathetic to the Mossad. Then, once the target was softened, they'd send Maxwell in for the kill.&quot;\npage 204\n\nMossad Made Saddam Hussein into a Villian Despite the Fact that Israel Considered Him a Moderate\nEphraim had spelled it out for me and confirmed some of the information IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d already known. He then went on. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAfter the bombing of Libya, our friend Qadhafi is sure to stay out of the picture for some time. Iraq and Saddam Hussein are the next target. We are starting now to build him up as the big villain. It will take some time, but in the end, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no doubt itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (spoken before the Gulf War)\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 117\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Mossad had all but saturated the intelligence field with information regarding the evil intentions of Saddam the Terrible, banking on the fact that before long, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d have enough rope to hang himself.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nIt was clear what the MossadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overall goal was. It wanted the West to do its bidding, just as the Americans had in Libya with the bombing of Qadhafi. After all, Israel didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t possess carriers and ample air power, and although it was capable of bombing a refugee camp in Tunis, that was not the same. The Mossad leaders knew that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf  oil supply, of which heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 254\n\nMossad Destabilizes Countries Through Various Means Including Civil Anarchy, Arming Religious Fanatics, and Assassinations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs long as it was political, it was fine, but now the Mossad is plunging headlong into this shit. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve decided that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to destabilize Jordan to the point of civil anarchy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDestabilize? How?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA high influx of counterfeit currency, causing distrust in the market; arming religious fundamentalist elements similar to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood; and assassinating leading figures who are symbols of stability, causing riots in the universities and forcing government to respond with harsh measures and lose popularityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the Mossad running weapons to the Egyptian fundamentalists through Afghanistan or something?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 143\n\nMossad Behind Privatization Initiatives\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe French wanted me to see what information I could gather on some people who, they were worried, were out to destabilize their South Pacific colonies. The plan of these supposed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdestabilizersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was to privatize a small country as a model for the world (in other words, create a small political system in which there is no government ownership and see if that model can be extrapolated to a wider setting). A subsidiary goal was to make money in various ways.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe first name on the list I was handed was Robert Pool, Jr. A prominent American, Pool was the leading advocate of privatization of the American aviation industry. He was the president of the Reason Foundation, located in Santa Monica, California.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThen there was a man called Harry Donald Schultz. He was living in the United States and, from time to time, in Monaco. SchultzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s partner was named Riner Dienharts. The Frenchman said that all these names tied in somehow with a Canadian foundation in Vancouver, British Columbia, called the Phoenix FoundationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPool was a member, if not a leader, of the Libertarian partyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 243-244\n\nMossad Conducts Sophisticated Pyschological Warfare Against All Nations, Especially the United States\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Operation Brush-Fire. This was an all-out LAP (LoAhma Psicologit - Israeli psychological warfare) attack aimed at getting the United States involved militarily in the Middle East in general and the Gulf area in particular.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Iran-Iraq war was over. It seemed that the Iranians had had enough and were happy to agree to end the war as the Iraqis wanted. The Mossad, for their part, pretended to the Americans that they wanted to topple Saddam Hussein, while at the same time passing on information to his Muchabarat from the Israeli embassy in Washington, warning him about various attempts on his life an don his regime. The Mossad regarded Saddam Hussein as their biggest asset in the area, since he was totally irrational as far as international politics was concerned, and was therefore all the more likely to make a stupid move that the Mossad could take advantage of.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMossad manipulated it so that Iraq looked as if it were the only country unwilling to talk, thereby convincing the Americans that Iraq had a different agenda.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy January 1989, the Mossad LAP machine was busy portraying Saddam as a tyrant and a danger to the world. The Mossad activated every asset it had, in every place possible, from volunteer agents in Amnesty International to fully bought members of the U.S. Congress.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 246-247\n\nMossad Armed and Supported the Kurds Against Iraq and Saddam\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSaddam had been killing his own people, the cry went; what could his enemies expect? The gruesome photos of dead Kurdish mothers clutching their dead babies after a gas attack by SaddamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s army were real, and the acts were horrendous. But the Kurds were entangled in an all-out guerrilla war with the regime in Baghdad and had been supported for years by the Mossad, who sent arms and advisers to the mountain camps of the Barazany family; this attack by the Iraqis could hardly be called and attack on their own people.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 247\n\nSayan (Secret Civilian Jewish Helpers) Break the Law to Help Mossad Carry Out Assassinations and Operations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey left the cars in an underground parking lot to be picked up the next day by a car sayan whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d rented the cars to them (Mossad assassins) without registering the rental.\n\nCanadian Judge Bars Discussion of OstrovskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s First Book After Pressure From Israeli Government\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Canadian judge had barred all discussions of the book for a period of ten days. I knew that this was the interval of time that the Mossad had to try to stop me.\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 264\n\nZionist Larry King and Guests Call Ostrovsky a Liar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jonathan Pollard Affair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Lavon Affair\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThen there was the Larry King Show, by which time the gag order was lifted, where I received somewhat rougher treatment. To build some contentiousness into the hour, the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s producers had invited Amos Perelmuter, a professor from the American University in Washington, D.C. to join King and me. From the start, it was clear that Perelmuter was an enthusiastic supporter of the state of Israel, and that what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d heard about my book-he admitted he hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t read it-he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like it/\nThere was never enough time on such shows to put Perelmuter and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdesignated champions of IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the spot. How did they know that everything I was saying was lies? I was the one whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d served in the Mossad, not they. Why was it that these loyal Americans were willing to accept any mud thrown at the CIA without even giving it a second though, but insisted on defending to the hilt an intelligence agency of a foreign country that had been known to spy on the United States (as in the Pollard case) and hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t refrained from attacking American interests (as in the case of the Lavon affair in Egypt, among others)\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 265\n\nOstrovsky Says Zionism and the State of Israel are a Racist, Prejudiced, and Oppressive Nightmare\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI had already realized for some time that I no longer shared that ideology that for me the state of Israel was no longer the fulfillment of an ancient dream. For me, it was more a nightmare of prejudice, wallowing in racism and waving the white and blue flag as a banner of oppression. I wanted no part of it. What I was doing now was showing the carriers of that banner their vulnerability, so that they would stop and reappraise their own purpose. Maybe then they could join the family of nations on an equal footing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 273\n\nMossad Planned an Assassination of George Bush Using Palestinian Patsies at the Madrid Peace Conference\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere was no doubt that Bush would be out of his element on October 30 when he arrived in Madrid to open the peace talksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nIt was clear from the start that the assassination would be blamed on the Palestinians-perhaps ending once and for all their irritating resistance and making them the people most hated by all Americans.\nThree Palestinian extremists were taken by a Kidon unit from their hiding place in Beirut and relocated incommunicado in a special detention location in the Negev desert. The three were Beijdun Salameh, Mohammed Hussein, and Hussein Shahin.\nAt the same time, various threats, some real and some not, were made against the president. The Mossad clique added its share, in order to more precisely define the threat as if it were coming from a group affiliated with a certain guarantee of getting attention and keeping it. So if something were to happen, the media would be quick to react and say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“We knew about it, and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget where you saw it first.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 278-279\n\nMossad Make Themselves Appear as the Heroes Even When They Murder (Bush Assassination Plot)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeveral days before the event, it was leaked to the Spanish police that the three terrorists were on their way to Madrid and that they were probably planning some extravagant action. Since the Mossad had all the security arrangements in hand, it would not be a problem for this particular clique to bring the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkillersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as close as they might want to the president and then stage a killing. In the ensuing confusion, the Mossad people would kill the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œperpetrators,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ scoring yet another victory for the Mossad. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be very sorry that they hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been able to save the president, but protecting him was not their job to begin with. With all the security forces involved and the assassins dead, it would be very difficult to discover where the security breach had been, except that several of the countries in involved in the conference, such as Syria, were regarded as countries that assisted terrorists. With that in mind, it would be a foregone conclusion where the breach was. As far as the Mossad clique was concerned, it was a win-win situation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 279-280\n\nMossad Used Their Media Control to Discredit Israeli Nuclear Whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut the Mossad had used its ace in the hole one time too many. Asking Maxwell to get involved in a matter of secondary importance (namely, the Vanunu affair) had been a big mistake, for which the media mogul would be made to pay the price.\nThat involvement caused suspicion in the British Parliament that there was no smoke without fire, particularly after the publication of a book by an American reporter claiming Maxwell was a Mossad agent. \nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky - The Other Side of Deception, page 284\n\nMossad Attempted Coup to Derail Democratization of Russia\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was Maxwell whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d helped created the ties with the now-defunct KGB. The right-wingers realized it would be a devastating blow to IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standing in the West of the world were to learn that the Mossad had participated in an way, as minute as that participation might be, in the attempted coup to stop the democratization of the Soviet Union. It would be perceived as treason against the WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nA small meeting of right-wingers at Mossad headquarters resulted in a consensus to terminate Maxwell.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated:\n\nBy Way of Deception - Victor Ostrovsky (Mossad Terrorism)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4274540/By_Way_of_Deception_-_Victor_Ostrovsky_(Mossad_Terrorism)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4274540/By_Way_of_Deception_-_Victor_Ostrovsky_(Mossad_Terrorism)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor el camino de la decepcion - Victor Ostrovsky y Claire Hoy (By Way of Deception in Spanish)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4280465/Por_el_camino_de_la_decepcion_-_Victor_Ostrovsky_y_Claire_Hoy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4280465/Por_el_camino_de_la_decepcion_-_Victor_Ostrovsky_y_Claire_Hoy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy public URL:\t &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy RSS feed:\t &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01c8bcd7f3882e2887dc97a7f13bf4230bdda98","amp;dn":"The+Other+Side+of+Deception+-+Victor+Ostrovsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01c8bcd7f3882e2887dc97a7f13bf4230bdda98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,28,139,205,127,56,130,226,136,125,201,122,127,19,191,66,48,189,218,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
