Scorned by the society of St. Petersburg for his trusting nature and naivety, he finds himself at the center of a struggle between a beautiful kept woman and a virtuous and pretty young girl, both of whom win his affection. Unfortunately, Myshkin's very goodness precipitates disaster, leaving the impression that, in a world obsessed with money, power, and sexual conquest, a sanatorium may be the only place for a saint.(Wikipedia) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0261a559cc2491aed28caad7aabccf3d5535b40","amp;dn":"The+Idiot+by+Fyodor+Mikhailovich+Dostoyevsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0261a559cc2491aed28caad7aabccf3d5535b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,38,26,85,156,194,73,26,237,40,202,173,122,171,204,243,213,83,91,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
