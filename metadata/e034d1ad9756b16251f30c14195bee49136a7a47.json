All it does is remove the ability for Windows to check if it needs activation and reminding you so. \n\nThe 4 original files are backedup with .backup extension in case you need to revert. You will also need to start the SL UI Notification service.\n\nWindows Server 2008 Bypass Activation v1.1\nReleased 3rd May, 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e034d1ad9756b16251f30c14195bee49136a7a47","amp;dn":"Windows+Server+2008+Activation+Bypass+Crack+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e034d1ad9756b16251f30c14195bee49136a7a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,52,209,173,151,86,177,98,81,243,12,20,25,91,238,73,19,106,122,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
