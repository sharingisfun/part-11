People over 45 aren't going to watch it. Louis (C.K.), to his credit - I think what he did was great - but he has a TV show. My demographic is, I think, wider spread than his, in that sense; my demographic is 15 to 90, it's crazy. What we're going to try to do, if all goes well, is pay-per-view, and that way if poor kids want to pay a few bucks apiece to watch me, great, and it puts it on the TV and it'll be done live. So, hopefully, that will work, and I'll find out if it works; it's what I wanted to do last time, we just couldn't get it done.&quot;\n\nWell, it's done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e05dc2587b95b11507355b8360901188f2fefb4a","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Lewis+Black+-+Old+Yeller+%28Live+at+the+Borgata%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e05dc2587b95b11507355b8360901188f2fefb4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,93,194,88,123,149,177,21,7,53,91,131,96,144,17,136,242,254,251,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
