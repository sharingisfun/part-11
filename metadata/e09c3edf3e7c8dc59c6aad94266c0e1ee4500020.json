A rip from a 2 CD set 'complete in verse and song'. About half are read, but, rather annoyingly, a few of the better known are not. I add a further selection from a variety of sources and also a bbc feature on the poem with Simon Russell Beale reading the poems.\n\nHousman is not as great a poet as his approximate contemporaries Thomas Hardy or W.B.Yeats. But he is perhaps valued as highly if only because, in the wake of the First War, the poetry acquired an added plangency. (The actual historical background is in fact the Boer War) A musical analogue is the emotion aroused by the Tallis Variations or the first movement of Elgar's Cello Concerto, both written at about the same time.\n\n(Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf. And if you want to know why poetry uploads are not in Audiobooks note that they used to be. But tpb banned texts and sundry interesting material I know you appreciate )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09c3edf3e7c8dc59c6aad94266c0e1ee4500020","amp;dn":"A.E.Housman+-+A+Shropshire+Lad+-+Alan+Bates+et+alia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09c3edf3e7c8dc59c6aad94266c0e1ee4500020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,156,62,223,62,124,141,197,156,106,173,148,38,108,14,30,228,80,0,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
