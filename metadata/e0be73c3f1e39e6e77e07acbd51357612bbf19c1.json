Bach - Brandenburg Concertos (Jean Pierre Rampal, Maurice Andre) \n\n\nFirst, I would not have known of this recording of the Brandenburgs were it not for Dark_Swordsman sharing it with us in 2009. I've listened to this countless times and the more I listen, the more I love it. Again, many thanks to Dark_Swordsman.\n\nI'm very excited to be able to share this copy of the Brandenburg Concertos after looking for a high quality version of it for the last couple years. I purchased my own copy about a year ago and the record seemed to be in great shape. The people at a high-end audio store - I won't say which one - actually let me listen to all four sides of it on their Wilson speakers and I was blown away. A guy who works there offered to rip it to HD 24/96... so here it is, converted to 320kbps mp3. \n\nI did not remaster or clean it up in any way and you can hear the pops and crackles of true vinyl. I'd say this rip sounds damn good; at the very least I can hear a lot of things in this rip that I don't notice in others.\n\n\n\nMay it bring you as much pleasure as it brings me ;)\n\n\n\n(I'm happy to upload the original HD 24/96 files as well if people want it. )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0be73c3f1e39e6e77e07acbd51357612bbf19c1","amp;dn":"J.S.+Bach+-+Brandenburg+Concertos%2C+Vinyl+Rip+%28Jean+Pierre+Rampal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0be73c3f1e39e6e77e07acbd51357612bbf19c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,190,115,195,241,227,158,110,119,224,122,203,213,19,87,97,43,191,25,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
