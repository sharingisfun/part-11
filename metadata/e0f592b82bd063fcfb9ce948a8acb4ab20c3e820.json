The team, a perennial loser and in financial trouble due to mill closings in the town, is due to be folded at season's end. Reggie Dunlop, the veteran player-coach (played by Newman), has no idea who the owner of the team is.\n\nThrough the course of regular business, the team picks up the Hanson Brothers, violent goons with child-like mentalities. Coach Dunlop, perceiving them to be eccentric and unreliable, initially chooses not to play them. Finally, in a moment of desperation and passiveness, he brings the trio of thugs into the game to see what they can do. Their big open-ice hits and overly aggressive - bordering on homicidal - style of play is greatly praised by the fans in desperate need of something for which to cheer.\n\nDunlop, seeing the potential in this style of play, retools the team in the Hansons' image. Most of the other players - including Dave &quot;Killer&quot; Carlson (Jerry Houser) - take a liking to this, with the exception of Ned Braden (Ontkean), used to a clean, flashy style of play from his college days. Meanwhile, Braden's wife, Lily (Lindsay Crouse), has difficulty adjusting to the life of a hockey wife and finds a sympathizer in Reggie Dunlop's long-estranged wife Francine (played by Jennifer Warren).\n\nAs a means of keeping his team motivated, Dunlop plants a story (which is an outright lie) that the Chiefs are being sold to a prospective buyer in Florida, who would move the team out of Charlestown. Finally, Dunlop blackmails the team's stingy General Manager Joe McGrath (played by Strother Martin) to tell him who the Chiefs' owner is. After finally meeting the owner (a widow living in a comfy suburb), she reveals to Reggie that she could easily sell the team now that he's turned them into winners, but that she won't, because she can make out better by folding the franchise and taking a tax write-off.\n\nThe whole idea turns around in the final playoff game when Reggie reveals to the players that he had been conning them; there is no buyer in Florida, the team is indeed folding, and most are about to play their last game. Reggie tells the players that if this is to be his last hockey game, he wants to go out with dignity and not like a goon. They all vow to play the game clean, going out playing good old-time hockey. However their vicious style of play down the stretch of the regular season and in the playoffs has provoked their final game opponents - the Syracuse Bulldogs - to put together the most infamous set of enforcers ever to disgrace a hockey rink, made up of legendary Federal League brawlers and a dreaded rookie goon, Ogie Ogilthorpe.\n\nThe clean playing Chiefs are out-matched and brutally battered by the Syracuse Bulldogs in first period, and in the locker room a furious McGrath tells the losing Chiefs that there are NHL scouts in the stands. The game then quickly degenerates into an on-ice slugfest. Suddenly, Ned Braden, who has been benched by Reggie Dunlop for not wanting to fight, spies his estranged wife Lily in the crowd, who has undergone a complete makeover by Francine and is wearing a sexy new dress and hairdo. He skates out to center ice and strips off his uniform - with the arena band getting into the act by playing &quot;The Stripper&quot;. Suddenly, the teams stop fighting and stare in amazement at Braden's striptease. Syracuse captain Tim &quot;Dr Hook&quot; McCracken demands that the referee stop Braden. When the official refuses, McCracken sucker-punches the ref, causing the referee to declare a forfeit by the Bulldogs, giving the game - and the Federal League championship - to the Chiefs. The team celebrates by parading around the ice with the championship trophy, carried by a jockstrap-only-clad Braden.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076723/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076723/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f592b82bd063fcfb9ce948a8acb4ab20c3e820","amp;dn":"SLAP-SHOT.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f592b82bd063fcfb9ce948a8acb4ab20c3e820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,245,146,184,43,208,99,252,251,156,233,72,168,172,180,171,32,195,232,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
