When a strange glacier appears in Tokyo Bay, Ken uses a ray of Chemical Z to break it apart, causing several black rays of light to fall through the city. When the rays strike objects, animals, or people, they turn into monsters. However three white lights also break away and strike three ordinary girls, who gain the power to transform into Powerpuff Z.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10de2dd3b7fbce4492d607559a29796fff01342","amp;dn":"Demashita%21+Powerpuff+Girls+Z+%5BDXO%5D+H264+Complete+1-26+English+Du","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10de2dd3b7fbce4492d607559a29796fff01342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,13,226,221,59,127,188,228,73,45,96,117,89,162,151,150,255,240,19,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
