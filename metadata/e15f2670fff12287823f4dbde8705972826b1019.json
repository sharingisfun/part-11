Now part 77 is dedicated to some sweet but darker synthwave/electrowave records. Some of you guys might still remember David Harrow's coolest song &quot;Our Little Girl&quot; or dark and moody tone of Experimental Products's &quot;Sweet Rejection&quot;! Hope you like'em! \n\n\nDavid Harrow - The Succession [1983]\n\nExperimental Products - Prototype  [1982]\n\nJohn Ruth - I Am A Model [1981]\n\nModern Art - Age of Lights [1986]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15f2670fff12287823f4dbde8705972826b1019","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+77%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15f2670fff12287823f4dbde8705972826b1019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,95,38,112,255,241,34,135,130,63,77,189,232,112,89,114,130,107,16,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
