Peter Egan (Bean: The Movie) plays the adult Pym, raised in part by his con-man father, Rick (Ray McAnally), and the latter's community of accomplices. Stranded in Vienna while working an angle for Rick that goes wrong, young Magnus (Benedict Taylor) makes a connection with a down-on-his-luck writer, Axel (Rudinger Weigang). That relationship will come back to haunt him when Axel--later a Communist spy--recruits Magnus to divide his loyalties between East and West.\n\nTypical of a Le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© drama, the role of nature versus nurture in the spy business is a complex and fascinating mystery. Magnus has always been a talented liar--it was part of his survival in childhood--and seems most comfortable infiltrating others' secrets and tempting danger. But he is slowly and effortlessly outsmarted by those who know how to maneuver a man into a corner before he realizes he has run out of options. The cast of this 1988 British television miniseries is the best thing about the production, especially McAnally (My Left Foot), who died the following year. Arthur Hopcraft's smooth adaptation of Le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s story keeps the sometimes complicated narrative accessible, --Tom Keogh\n\nProduct Description:\n\nWhat traits of nature and nurture go into the making of a master of deception? British agent Magnus PymÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s training begins in a chaotic childhood. His charismatic con man father trades secrets for love, bouncing in and out of jail and his sonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life. Schooled at Oxford and mentored by two masters of espionage, Magnus is poised for greatnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½except that his mentors are on opposite sides of the battle.\n\nWith characters drawn from his own life, le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© weaves a gripping tale of international intrigue brilliantly adapted for the BBC by Arthur Hopcraft, who also adapted le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy for television.
