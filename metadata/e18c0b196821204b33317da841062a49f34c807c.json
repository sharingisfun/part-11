Nazarov, Y. Blanter (CUP, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nThis textbook is a comprehensive introduction to the rapidly developing and diverse field of quantum transport, which is seemingly contains seemingly contradicting concepts - quantum and classical, conduction and insulating - within a single nanodevice.. The authors present the broad theoretical background, and explore the groundbreaking experiments that laid the foundations of the field. Ideal for graduate students, each section contains control questions and exercises to check readers' understanding of the topics covered. Its broad scope and in-depth analysis of selected topics will appeal to researchers and professionals working in nanoscience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18c0b196821204b33317da841062a49f34c807c","amp;dn":"Quantum+Transport+Introduction+to+Nanoscience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18c0b196821204b33317da841062a49f34c807c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,140,11,25,104,33,32,75,51,49,125,168,65,6,42,73,243,76,128,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
