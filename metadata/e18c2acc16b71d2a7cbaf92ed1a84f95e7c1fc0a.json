Tested it out and was able to use the program and save my progress.\n\n1) install Zbrush 4r5 full (MD5: 478c0ab9b8f7cdfe084d4ec685c0a90f)\n2) activate using xforce keygen\n3) copy Patch4r5.exe to same folder as ZBrush.exe\n4) run Patch4r5.exe\n\nenjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18c2acc16b71d2a7cbaf92ed1a84f95e7c1fc0a","amp;dn":"Zbrush+4R5+patchfix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18c2acc16b71d2a7cbaf92ed1a84f95e7c1fc0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,140,42,204,22,183,29,42,124,186,249,46,209,168,79,149,231,193,252,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
