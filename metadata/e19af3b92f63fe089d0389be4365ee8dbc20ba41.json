But nothing goes smoothly.\n\nEpisode 1:\n__\n\nEven their packing proves a trial for the trouble-prone J, Harris and George. On the eve of the trip they manage to oversleep, they struggle to find the right train from Waterloo to Kingston and get hopelessly lost in the maze at Hampton Court. They navigate their first lock successfully and end up at yet another hostelry 'for just one drink', but the evening ends on a dangerous note - Harris decides he will sing a comic song. Oh dear.\n\nEpisode 2:\n___\n\nHarris, unable to recollect words or tune, attempts a comic song - to the dismay of J, George and other revellers. J buys a round for the whole pub to compensate. After a meal of cold beef but no mustard, they cheer up at the prospect of pineapple - but they've forgotten the tin opener. And nothing - not the penknife, the scissors, the hitcher, a sharp stone or the mast - can break into that tin. Their last night on the river involves another sing-song at another pub of course, but not before Harris and Montmorency survive a serious encounter with swans.\n\nThree Men In A Boat has never been out of print since its first publication in 1889. In stark contrast to the adventure writers of the time - Kipling, Haggard and Stevenson - Jerome K Jerome gave us a story about three ordinary fellows having a jolly time down the river.\n\nCast:\n__\n\nJ -  Julian Rhind-Tutt\nGeorge -  Steve Punt\nHarris -  Hugh Dennis\nMrs P - Katherine Jakeways\nProducer - Melanie Harris\nProducer -  Polly Thomas\nAdaptor - Chris Harrald\nAuthor - Jerome K Jerome \n\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\n\n[TY 2 RA]\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
