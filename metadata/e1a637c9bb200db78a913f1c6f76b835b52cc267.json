However, he escapes before she sees him, when he hears that his current girlfriend has been murdered. The wife searches the slum area of Honolulu known as Hell's Half Acre for him, he searches for his girlfriend's killer, and his gangland associates are looking for the two of them\nThe drama related the tale of ex-racketeer Chet Chester (Corey) who is blackmailed by his former criminal partners.\nChester's girlfriend Sally (Nancy Gates) kills one of his enemies. But Chester takes the blame, assuming that he has still got enough clout to escape with a light sentence.\nMeanwhile, Dona Williams (Keyes) flies to Hawaii because she is certain that Chester is her long-lost husband who was thought to have died at Pearl Harbor.\n\nCritical response\nThe New York Times gave the film a positive review and wrote, &quot;Betwixt the start and the finish, an undemanding spectator will find enough sequences of merit to hold his interest. And the story of destined doom and back-alley murder is not entirely implausible. Miss Keyes, an innocent caught in the tangled web, is a luscious young thing who certainly earns her &quot;A&quot; in acting. She shines nicely in contrast to the denizens of Hell's Half Acre, ostensibly a very unsocial area of Honolulu. John Auer, the director, makes his camera capture the most in picture value of what appears to be some very dingy neighborhoods with a resultant atmosphere that creates a certain element of suspense. His method of direction, aided and abetted by Steve Fisher's economical script, is one of sensible brevity without unnecessary frills.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 90 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 90 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a637c9bb200db78a913f1c6f76b835b52cc267","amp;dn":"Hell%27s+Half+Acre+%281954%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Evelyn+Keyes%2C+Wendell+Corey+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a637c9bb200db78a913f1c6f76b835b52cc267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,166,55,201,187,32,13,183,138,145,63,28,111,118,184,53,181,44,194,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
