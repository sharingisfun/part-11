Originally known as AL6 (the 6th design of AC locomotives) under the earlier BR classification, the Class 86 was built to operate on the then newly-electrified West Coast Main Line, and formed part of the effort replace steam locomotives by 1968. Throughout the 1970s the Class 86 was used on express passenger services as well as freight but with the demand for electric locomotives increasing, by the 1980s the need for a standard fleet saw all the Class 86s fitted with improved suspension giving them greater operational flexibility. The Class 86 for Train Simulator comes with two Freightliner liveries as well as RailFreight Grey, Rail Express Services and BR Blue liveries, together with rolling stock. The Class 86 also features an accurate recreation of the tap changer power control found in the real locomotive: this realistic feature offers a lifelike driving experience but can be challenging for less experienced Train Simulator drivers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ please refer to the manual for full driving instructions\n\nIncludes:\nClass 86 electric locomotive in Freightliner Green, Freightliner Powerhaul, Rail Express Systems, RailFreight Grey (6 different sectors) and BR Blue liveries \nBritish Rail Mk2 First Corridor, Second Open and Brake Second Open coaches \nFSA container bogie wagons \n6 scenarios to drive on the West Coast Main Line route (available separately). \n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nFor questions, support and requests join here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nemail for support:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ee9a8b8f839a9e8cda8b988b9cae89838f8782c08d8183&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1df1b9bc92616a7e53f191ec3053dab1a2c0379","amp;dn":"Railworks+4+Class+86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1df1b9bc92616a7e53f191ec3053dab1a2c0379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,223,27,155,201,38,22,167,229,63,25,30,195,5,61,171,26,44,3,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
