Friday Night Dinner is a truly\n                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have\n                made an art form of their eccentricities. In the\n                third episode, Mum's excited about the new curtains,\n                but the boys and Grandma think they're horrible. Mum\n                is annoyed. Meanwhile, Dad drops Mum's beef casserole\n                all over the kitchen floor. It looks disgusting. Dad\n                scoops it back into the dish. The boys are not happy\n                about their meal. Later, the argument about the\n                curtains spreads, and Jonny leaves in a huff to go to\n                the pub. Adam joins him. At home, Mum and Grandma are\n                still not talking, so it rests with Adam to resolve\n                the family argument. But can Adam save the day?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e281d472b9a3240a170eb49c3193f74fca02b236","amp;dn":"Friday.Night.Dinner.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e281d472b9a3240a170eb49c3193f74fca02b236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,129,212,114,185,163,36,10,23,14,180,156,49,147,247,79,202,2,178,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
