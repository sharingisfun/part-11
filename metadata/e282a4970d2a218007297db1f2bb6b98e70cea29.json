Or it could be from his turn as Joe Garrelli on NEWS RADIO. Or as the host of the MAN SHOW. Or even more recently as the spokesperson for the UFC. What you may not know is that Joe Rogan is one of the top comedians in the country. He sells out big rooms from coast to coast on the strength of his fantastic comedy and this disc solidifies him as one of the most important voices in the country. Joe&amp;#039;s hard-edged, uncensored, and, yes, smart view of the world shines through on his new album (his first, I&amp;#039;m Gonna Be Dead Someday (Warner Bros.) received critical acclaim and solid sales). With sharp insights on the Middle East, sex, religion, and a host of other topics, there are no taboos.\n\nThis is some really funny shit!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e282a4970d2a218007297db1f2bb6b98e70cea29","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Shiny+Happy+Jihad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e282a4970d2a218007297db1f2bb6b98e70cea29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,130,164,151,13,42,33,128,7,41,125,177,242,187,107,152,231,12,234,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
