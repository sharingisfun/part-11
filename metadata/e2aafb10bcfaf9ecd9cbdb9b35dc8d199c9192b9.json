This would be the real Constitution (the one with invisible amendments), created by some of the Founding Fathers as a fall back for their great experiment. Along the way, McGill gains a polyamorous sidekick named Trix, gets scared to death by what men do with warm salty water, and descends into a world where crime, sex, and madness all seem to be the same thing.\n\nFull of mind-bending style and packed with a wild cast of characters, Crooked Little Vein infuses Robert B. Parker with Kurt Vonnegut and the madness of the graphic-novel world. A surprisingly surreal treat, it will appeal to hardcore comic fans, mystery aficionados, and anybody looking for a riotous adventure.\n\nThis is one of my favorites. It's absolutely hilarious","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2aafb10bcfaf9ecd9cbdb9b35dc8d199c9192b9","amp;dn":"Crooked+Little+Vein%3A+A+Novel+-+Warren+Ellis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2aafb10bcfaf9ecd9cbdb9b35dc8d199c9192b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,170,251,16,188,250,249,236,217,203,219,155,53,220,141,25,156,145,146,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
