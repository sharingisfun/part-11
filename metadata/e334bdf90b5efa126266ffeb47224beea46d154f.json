Yes, the cover is basically non-existent. Yes, it is still totally readable. In fact, it doesn't really get in the way at all, and this is still one of the best looking things Corben ever did. I have an even better looking version of this, but it's in French. If I feel like gettin' crazy with the Cheez Whiz one day I might go ahead and drop all the English text over the French word bubbles. For now, I hope you enjoy this one as is...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Arabian Nights'\n\nHeavy Metal Presents, 1979\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Jan Strnad and Richard Corben\n\nIntroduction by Harlan Ellison","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e334bdf90b5efa126266ffeb47224beea46d154f","amp;dn":"Richard+Corben+-+Arabian+Nights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e334bdf90b5efa126266ffeb47224beea46d154f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,52,189,249,11,94,250,18,98,102,255,235,71,34,75,238,164,109,21,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
