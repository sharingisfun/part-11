The original score was composed by the British big beat duo The Chemical Brothers. Initially, the album was only released digitally, but it was released on CD on July 4, 2011 by Sony Music.\nThe soundtrack received mostly positive responses from music critics, with many praising The Chemical Brothers for producing solid background music. However, a few critics have cited a lack of experimentation as its flaw. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album holds a score of 65, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, based on seven reviews compiled from critics. Chad Grischow of IGN reserved high praise for the soundtrack, feeling the &quot;duo nail the mix of violence and innocence&quot;.[\n\nCD  - Track Listings\n\n[01] Hanna's Theme\n[02] Escape 700\n[03] Chalice 1\n[04] The Devil Is In The Details\n[05] Map Sounds / Chalice 2\n[06] The Forest\n[07] Quayside Synthesis\n[08] The Sandman\n[09] Marissa Flashback\n[10] Bahnhof Rumble\n[11] The Devil Is In The Beats\n[12] Car Chase (Arp Worship)\n[13] Interrogation / Lonesome Subway / Grimm's House\n[14] Hanna Vs.
