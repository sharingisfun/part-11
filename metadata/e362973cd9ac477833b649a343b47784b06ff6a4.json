First appearing in 1924, this is a truly pioneering work of Catholic theology, one that had a major influence on subsequent theology.\n\nKarl Adam, one of the greatest of living theologians, was born in Bavaria in 1876, one of a family of ten. He received his education at the Classical Gymnasium at Amburg; the Philosophical and Theological Seminary at Regensburg; and received his Doctorate at the University of Munich in 1904. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1900 and spent the following two years doing parish work. His scholarly and theological interests soon became apparent and it was to this field that he naturally turned. In these early years his writing was specialized and was concentrated on the history of dogma. These earlier specialized works have never been translated but have been described by scholars in the field as outstanding.\n\nIn 1915 he became a professor at Munich and two years later assumed the Chair of Moral Theology at Strasbourg. In 1919 he went to the University of Tuebingen to take over the Chair of Dogmatic Theology. It was at Tuebingen that he delivered the famous lectures on the Church which brought him world-wide fame. He is also considered an outstanding authority of the theology of St. Augustine and is known for his great love for tradition and the Fathers of the Church.\n\nHis eminent position in the field of theology has been recognized for many years but his unswerving fidelity to his beliefs has often led him into great difficulties. A man of great dynamic force and personality, his style captivates readers and listeners alike, but any attempt to compromise or transmute his faith results in a forceful roar of protest.\n\nIn 1934 his integrity compelled him to deliver an outspoken denunciation of the so-called German religion in an address on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Eternal ChristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which led him into difficulties with the Nazi government. He was threatened with physical harm, his house was riddled with bullets, his life was threatened and his right to lecture was denied him. So strong were the feelings that he aroused that he was forced to flee to the Bishop of Rottenburg for protection. Despite all such threats and attempts at intimidation he steadfastly clung to his position, refusing to compromise what he believed were basic truths.\n\nHis writings have all revolved around the necessity for an understanding of our relationship with Christ Himself with particular stress on the doctrine of the Mystical Body. He feels strongly that the doctrine of the Mystical Body is particularly suitable to the problems of our modern day, when mankind is desperately seeking a principle of unity. He constantly stresses this approach for a solution of world problems and just as categorically condemns mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reliance on purely human or material bonds of unity.\n\nIt is this stress upon the common meeting place of all mankind which has resulted in his strong appeal to non-Catholics. For years he has been tremendously interested in and has been working tirelessly for a union of Christian faiths in one faith. This theme runs through all of his books. Even his earlier limited works such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“TertullianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Conception of the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eucharistic Teaching of St. AugustineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reflected this concern. His later books, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christ Our Brother,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Son of God,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Spirit of CatholicismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“One And HolyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were increasingly preoccupied with this all important phase of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life on earth.\n\nOf all his books Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Spirit of CatholicismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has probably been his most influential. Originally published in Germany in 1924, it has been translated into French, Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, Hungarian, Latin, Chinese and Japanese. Since publication in the United States it has appeared in eleven printings.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Spirit Of CatholicismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was written to provide a calm, dispassionate, clearly written consideration of the fundamental concepts of the Catholic faith which would explain to all, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, exactly what the Catholic Church is. Karl Adam has brilliantly succeeded in achieving his purpose and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Spirit of CatholicismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now stands as one of the finest introductions to the Catholic faith written in this century.\n\n--\n\nPlease seed!\n\nMore:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic/&quot;
