In the 1980's, Maryann Kinkade is behind in her mortgage payments and about to lose her small house in Placerville, a town in California's gold country in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Her son Thom, who's attended art school and is in his 20s, determines to make the transition from amateur to professional painter to help save the family's home. He seeks advice from an aging mentor. \n\nReturning home from college one Christmas, young artist Thomas Kinkade (Jared Padalecki) is dismayed to learn that attempts to promote local tourism have failed and his mother (Marcia Gay Harden) is dangerously close to losing the family cottage to foreclosure. Inspired by his mentor, Glen (Peter O' Toole), a famous artist who lives next door, Thom accepts a job painting a mural of his small, idyllic hometown. With Glen's help, Thom not only discovers his calling as the Painter of Light but also helps the town rediscover the true spirit of Christmas in this nostalgic, humorous and heartwarming true story destined to become a holiday classic. \n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nLove is the brightest light of all.     \n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18024275666995428005.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18024275666995428005.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13932093864053470615.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13932093864053470615.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/38341938518469943172.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/38341938518469943172.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91146876927324999811.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91146876927324999811.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/92768485923730916056.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/92768485923730916056.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72719139356298684370.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72719139356298684370.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73895367509863524135.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73895367509863524135.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players, XBox 360 &amp; PS3 compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
