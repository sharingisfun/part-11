The other member is Jason Buckle. It has been alleged that Jason Buckle is a pseudonym for Pulp guitarist Richard Hawley, but this is not the case - Hawley does contribute guitar to the album, however, under the pseudonym Wayne Marsden.\n\nRelaxed Muscle&amp;#039;s music is not similar to Pulp, it is closer to the Fat Truckers crude electro.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44dde4be81932dd492cdb9042c12a5c891dc065","amp;dn":"Relaxed+Muscle+-+A+Heavy+Night+With...+%28Jarvis+Cocker%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44dde4be81932dd492cdb9042c12a5c891dc065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,77,222,75,232,25,50,221,73,44,219,144,66,193,42,92,137,29,192,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
