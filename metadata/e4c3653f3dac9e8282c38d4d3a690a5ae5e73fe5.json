A respected resource for clinical faculty, it addresses the distinct requirements of clinical learning as opposed to classroom learning and provides proven strategies to maximize clinical education. The revision features expanded content on teaching graduate students, regulatory issues affecting distance education, and the use of social media. It covers establishing and using dedicated education units (DEUs), the challenges of student access to electronic health records and documentation of care, and reducing the demands of clinical staff members when multiple students rotate through a particular setting.\n\nAdditionally, this edition provides guidelines for using preceptors, evaluating multimedia, and observing students in practice; sample observation guidelines, learning assignments, and clinical learning activities; and sample policies for clinical evaluation and adherence to professional conduct standards.
