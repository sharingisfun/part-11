As he \n\ntakes us through the history of our modern comforts, Bryson demonstrates that \n\nwhatever happens in the world eventually ends up in our home, in the paint, the \n\npipes, the pillows, and every item of furniture. Bryson has one of the liveliest, \n\nmost inquisitive minds on the planet, and his sheer prose fluency makes At Home one \n\nof the most entertaining books ever written about private life.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4cbc5ea98385392fa7f1c4b0bcc12b9b34d3972","amp;dn":"%28Retail%29Bill+Bryson+%28Epub%29+-+At+Home+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4cbc5ea98385392fa7f1c4b0bcc12b9b34d3972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,203,197,234,152,56,83,146,250,127,28,75,11,204,18,185,179,77,57,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
