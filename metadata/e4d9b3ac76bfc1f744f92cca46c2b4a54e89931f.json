Kelsey Summers is no exception. She's having the time of her life . . . or that's what she keeps telling herself.\n\nIt's a lonely business trying to find out who you are, especially when you're afraid you won't like what you discover. No amount of drinking or dancing can chase away Kelsey's loneliness, but maybe Jackson Hunt can. After a few chance meetings, he convinces her to take a journey of adventure instead of alcohol. With each new city and experience, Kelsey's mind becomes a little clearer and her heart a little less hers. Jackson helps her unravel her own dreams and desires. But the more she learns about herself, the more Kelsey realizes how little she knows about Jackson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4d9b3ac76bfc1f744f92cca46c2b4a54e89931f","amp;dn":"Cora+Carmack_Finding+It+%28Losing+It+Series+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4d9b3ac76bfc1f744f92cca46c2b4a54e89931f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,217,179,172,118,191,193,247,68,249,44,202,70,194,180,165,78,137,147,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
