Some songs we couldn't even find, as they were     \n done on old computers that have long been obsolete, soaking up \n water under a leaky roof in my garage. Pretty early on I       \n realized the secret would be to bring in musicians far better  \n than ourselves and lots of them! Two weeks before the show the \n band had never even met each other, even though I had recorded \n some of them individually in my studio for previous Shpongle   \n albums. Pixel Addicts took care of the lights, showing me      \n complicated diagrams on their laptops which I pretended to     \n understand, having no clue how it would actually look on the   \n night. Meanwhile we all rehearsed in a darkened room, with no  \n air or daylight, getting to know each other by smell alone and \n perhaps sound. Reams of manuscript paper littered the floor,   \n everyone wore ear plugs, and all I could think was 'What the   \n hell am I doing?'. It is a testament to their talent, hard     \n work and skill that you are not holding a blank DVD in your    \n hands right now. We didn't know if we would ever repeat the    \n performance, so recorded it for posterity... Surely only an    \n idiot would actually release their first ever gig though,      \n right?  We hope you like it, it was made with love, sweat       \n and laughter...                                         \n                                                           \n    Link:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.twistedmusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.twistedmusic.com&lt;/a&gt;                  \n\n  Tracklist:                                         \n                                                       \n   01 - Ineffable Mysteries                           \n   02 - Beija Flor                                    \n   03 - Dorset Perception                            \n   04 - Periscopes of consciousness                  \n   05 - I am you                                   \n   06 - Star Shpongled Banner                       \n   07 - My head feels like a frisbee                 \n   08 - When shall I be free                          \n   09 - No Turn Un-Stoned                              \n   10 - Divine moments of truth                        \n   11 - Shpongle Interlude.                            \n   12 - Nothing is something Worth Doing               \n   13 - Once Upon The Sea of blissful awareness        \n   14 - Around the world in a tea daze                 \n   15 - Shpongle Interview                             \n   16 - Shpongled with Raja Ram                        \n   17 - Event Time Lapse                               \n   18 - Live at Rehearsals                             \n   19 - Raja's Extra                                   \n                                                       \n                                                    \n Enjoy this Psychedelic Baby!                       \n\n=================================================\n\n\nMediaInfo:\nComplete name                    : Shpongle_Concert.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.89 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 55mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 343 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 55mn\nBit rate                         : 2 013 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 088 pixels\nHeight                           : 592 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.125\nStream size                      : 1.62 GiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 55mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 264 MiB (14%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e550642e7b683b0c457d3c8ab7bd2ad339fdf157","amp;dn":"Shpongle+Live+at+the+Roundhouse+in+London+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e550642e7b683b0c457d3c8ab7bd2ad339fdf157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,80,100,46,123,104,59,12,69,125,60,138,183,189,42,211,57,253,241,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
