Turn off internet connnection\n2. Install from setup.exe, name doesn't matter, and serial is as follows: two capital letters then five random numbers, ex: SC54321\n3. turn off uptodate then go to the following directory: &quot;C:\\Users\\[yourname]\\UpToDate\\app&quot; then open &quot;param.xml&quot; using your notepad, then change SC54321 to SC54320 (i.e. keep changing the number randomly, a good method is to change the last number only 0-9 &quot;excluding 1 in our example&quot;)\n4. run uptodate, and press &quot;activate&quot;, if it doesn't work, try to activate again till it works or &quot;3-attempt&quot; message shows. in the latter case, go back to step 3, otherwise ENJOY!\n5. Still not working? uninstall and reinstall using other 2 Capital letters (ex. RE45321)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n* I claim no credit for this, I just want to share it!\n* There's a high possibility that you may fail to install uptodate!!\n* a patch for 18.1 is out there and could work for this version as well (or so they claim), but the method above worked for me.\n* I haven't compresssed this so that anyone who has the program already can seed it directly since my connection is so slow.\n\nThis is my first torrent, so be gentle please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e56c0fc30c1b420517593b767364bd4855648b9c","amp;dn":"UpToDate+18.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e56c0fc30c1b420517593b767364bd4855648b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,108,15,195,12,27,66,5,23,89,59,118,115,100,189,72,85,100,139,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
