Understanding the\nprinciples on which it is based is an important topic that requires a knowledge of both\ncomputational complexity and a range of topics in pure mathematics. This book provides\nthat knowledge, combining an informal style with rigorous proofs of the key results to\ngive an accessible introduction. It comes with plenty of examples and exercises (many\nwith hints and solutions), and is based on a highly successful course developed and\ntaught over many years to undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics and\ncomputer science.\nThe opening chapters are a basic introduction to the theory of algorithms: fundamental\ntopics such as NP-completeness, CookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorem, the P vs. NP question, probabilistic\ncomputation and primality testing give a taste of the beauty and diversity of the subject.\nAfter briefly considering symmetric cryptography and perfect secrecy, the authors introduce\npublic key cryptosystems. The mathematics required to explain how these work\nand why or why not they might be secure is presented as and when required, though\nappendices contain supplementary material to fill any gaps in the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s background.\nStandard topics, such as the RSA and ElGamal cryptosystems, are treated. More recent\nideas, such as probabilistic cryptosystems (and the pseudorandom generators on which\nthey are based), digital signatures, key establishment and identification schemes are also\ncovered.\njohn talbot has been a lecturer in mathematics, University College London since\n2003. Before that he was GCHQ Research Fellow in Oxford.\ndominic welsh is a fellow of Merton College, Oxford where he was Professor of\nMathematics. He has held numerous visiting positions including the John von Neumann\nProfessor, University of Bonn. This is his fifth book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b6391a2bcd55b32b74cf1cbf98f68846e61615","amp;dn":"Cambridge.University.Press.Complexity.and.Cryptography.An.Introd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b6391a2bcd55b32b74cf1cbf98f68846e61615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,182,57,26,43,205,85,179,43,116,207,28,191,152,246,136,70,230,22,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
