With Lightroom for mobile, you can sync photo collections effortlessly across devices (including your desktop), make over 40 one-click adjustments, or dive deep into the more fine-tuned editing controls. This overview is a fun exploration of the creative possibilities offered by the app. Chris Orwig, a teacher and professional photographer, shows how to view and rate images, select the &quot;keepers,&quot; crop photos and fine-tune color, change looks quickly with adjustment presets, share your photos online, and combine Lightroom for mobile with other photo editing apps such as Adobe Fix and Mix. \r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tImporting photos in the Lightroom mobile app\r\n\tâ€¢\tSynchronizing collections in Lightroom for desktop\r\n\tâ€¢\tRating and organizing photos with flags and stars\r\n\tâ€¢\tMaking photo adjustments\r\n\tâ€¢\tCropping photos\r\n\tâ€¢\tApplying presets\r\n\tâ€¢\tFine-tuning color\r\n\tâ€¢\tApplying a vignette\r\n\tâ€¢\tSharing photos from Lightroom for mobile\r\n\tâ€¢\tRetouching with Adobe Fix\r\n\tâ€¢\tCombining photos with Adobe Mix\r\n\tâ€¢\tEditing photos offline\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with gestures\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67599f29c6f120f16199db18e4e51924ba91d89","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Learn+Lightroom+Mobile%3A+The+Basics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67599f29c6f120f16199db18e4e51924ba91d89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,117,153,242,156,111,18,15,22,25,157,177,142,78,81,146,75,169,29,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
