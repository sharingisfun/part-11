C. Cole in her\nentrancing journey into the heart of Nothing. Every time\nscientists and mathematicians think they have reached\nthe ultimate void, new stuff appears: a black hole, an\nundulating string, an additional dimension of space or\ntime, repulsive anti-gravity, universes that breed like\nbunnies. Cole's exploration at the edge of everything\nis as animated and exciting as the void itself. Take\nCole's hand on this adventure into the unknown, and\nyou'll come back informed, amused, and excited.\n\nThe Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered Over\nthe Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything\nBy: K.C.
