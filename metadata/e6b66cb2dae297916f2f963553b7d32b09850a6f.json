Think about a simple idea for a comedy, put some musical numbers (mostly samba), don't care too much about the quality of the acting and remember, the good is always good and the bad is always bad (and is caught by the Justice in the end).\n\nSimple isn't? The best chanchadas were from a studio called AtlÃƒÂ¢ntida and if Oscarito was in one you knew that good laughs, and memorable moments of the comedy in the cinema, were ahead.\n\nAs in this movie, Oscarito (as BarnabÃƒÂ©) becomes the target of everybody else in the movie; the police, the crooks, the press AND an oriental princess who wants to marry him. The translation of the tittle is 'BarnabÃƒÂ©, You're Mine'. After a good one hour and a half of fun (alright there are some moments that are not really that fun but they are very few), you understand why Oscarito was the king of the chanchadas. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : BarnabÃƒÂ© Tu Ãƒâ€°s Meu.1952.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 214 Kbps\nLength            : 1.39 GiB for 1h 29mn 43s 211ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 010 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 540 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181972/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181972/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Portuguese\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b66cb2dae297916f2f963553b7d32b09850a6f","amp;dn":"Barnab%26eacute%3B+Tu+%26Eacute%3Bs+Meu.1952.DVDRip.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b66cb2dae297916f2f963553b7d32b09850a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,182,108,178,218,226,151,145,111,47,150,53,83,183,211,43,9,133,10,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
