But due\nsome sites unnuked their Release, we thought we'll waste more of our\nprecious time.\n\nFair and square - CODEX stole our Ubisoft emulation code. NO!, we wont\npost any more proofs, because it's rather silly to show more of our\ncode into the public. Furthermore, we wont give CODEX the oppetunity to\nget help in finding all of our &quot;stealth&quot; API calls inside the code.\n\nIf siteops want to keep our true proper Release nuked, so be it, but at\nthe least know why you're nuking - not because &quot;old legends&quot; tell you\nso.\n\nCODEX, we even wrote to you, about our little discovery, before we\npre'ed our true proper, but yet you have decided to keep silent.\n\nAnd yes, we could proper more of your shit, but that's not important to\nus. .\n\nWe just want your dirty hands to be kept in your own pockets, and not\ninside our cookie jar.\n\nAnd to all nukers - CODEX did set the wrong parameter for &quot;CreateFile&quot;\nAPI when it comes to &quot;folders&quot;. We do use &quot;GENERIC_READ&quot;, cause of an\nimportant point, Windows simply don`t allow &quot;GENERIC_ALL&quot; without admin\nrights. That's another valid nuke reason.\n\nEnd of story!\nRead changelog.txt for information on updated content!\n\nInstall Notes:\n1. Unpack Release\n2. Run Trials.Fusion.Update.1.exe\n3. Install\n4.
