This guy\\&amp;#039;s amazing, though-- recorded all of the parts himself at home in his studio, no small feat in 1970.  This is the first of his albums, occasionally available as imports on CD commanding a fairly high price, and damn hard to find anywhere.\n\nThis particular set of 320Kbps mp3\\&amp;#039;s is a conversion I did in my home studio from my stereo reel-to-reel deck to my hard drive.  The fidelity of the recording is preserved in its original form-- I didn\\&amp;#039;t tweak the sound, just split up the files for CD tracks and added some minor fade-ins-&amp;-outs.  Considering the age of the reels, I think it came off pretty well-- the tape itself is in excellent condition.\n\nIf you love 70\\&amp;#039;s British pop, you\\&amp;#039;ll love this!  It\\&amp;#039;s all good, but highlights are \n\\&quot;Live Till You Die,\\&quot; \\&quot;Somebody Made For Me,\\&quot; and \\&quot;You Take the Dark Out of the Night.\\&quot;  For more on Emitt Rhodes, visit: http://users2.ev1.net/~kryan73/emitt/themusic.html\n\n:::::Emitt Rhodes [self-titled, 1970, Dunhill Records]:::::\n1.
