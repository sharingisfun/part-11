Yes guitarist Steve Howe's son Virgil (aka &quot;the Verge&quot;) pulled apart some of the band's lesser-known works, adding trance beats and electronic blurps, in a sense recontextualizing this airy prog rock for the new millennium. While the experiment is well executed, the resulting tracks are not as interesting as the original album tracks, nor as inventive as much of what is being recorded in contemporary electronica, but landing somewhere in the middle of both. The idea is certainly interesting, and there may be no better source material than Yes' spacy, arty, super-prog, but Yes fans will only be inspired to bust out the old LPs, and ravers certainly won't crack open their glow sticks at the first beats of &quot;Starship Trooper.&quot; Good for a listen, but probably won't spawn an entire new genre.\nAll music Review by Zac Johnson  \n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Tempus Fugit\n[02] Arriving UFO\n[03] Heart Of The Sunrise\n[04] Starship Trooper\n[05] Awaken\n[06] Sound Chaser\n[07] Ritual\n[08] Siberian Khatru\n[09] 5 Per Cent For Nothing\n[10] No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\n[11] No Clowns\n\nPlay Time - 01h:02m:10s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 142mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
