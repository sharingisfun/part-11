Patched and Keygen-R2R [deepstatus]\r\n\r\nTDR VOS SlickEQ â€“ Gentlemanâ€™s Edition takes SlickEQâ€˜s concept to new heights and adds an exotic â€œTiltâ€-filter flanked by flexible low-pass and high-pass filters. Five distinct EQ models provide a rich set of predefined EQ curves and behaviours for the three main semi parametric filter bands.\r\n\r\nSlickEQ GE offers a switchable EQ non-linearity as well as six different output stages. These options offer subtle and interesting textures, from the typical â€œmojoâ€ often associated with high quality analogue audio gear, up to more obvious saturation.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate auto gain option automatically compensates for changes of perceived-loudness during EQ (within reasonable limits) and a gain-trim feature helps controlling peak overloads with ease. The 64bit multi-rate processing scheme (a.k.a. â€œinternal re-samplingâ€) practically eliminates typical problems of digital EQ implementations such as frequency-warping, quantization distortion and aliasing.\r\n\r\nBeside the primary controls, the plug-in comes with an array of additional helpers: Advanced preset management, a frequency magnitude plot, undo/redo, quick A/B comparison, copy &amp; paste, an online help, editable labels, mouse-wheel support and much more. Finally, SlickEQ GE allows to exclusively process the stereo sum or stereo difference without external sum/difference encoding (see â€œM/Sâ€ microphony).\r\n\r\nKey specs and features\r\nModern user interface with outstanding usability and ergonomics\r\nCarefully designed 64bit â€œdeltaâ€ multi-rate structure\r\nThree semi-parametric filter bands, each with two shape options\r\nFive distinct EQ models: American, British, German, Soviet and Japanese\r\nLow band offers an optional phase-lag able to delay low frequencies relative to higher frequencies\r\nHigh pass filter with optional â€œBumpâ€ mode\r\nLow pass filter with two different slopes (6dB/Oct and 12dB/Oct)\r\nParametric Tilt filter with optional â€œVâ€ mode.\r\nSix output stages: Linear, Silky, Mellow, Deep, Excited and Toasted\r\nAdvanced saturation algorithms by VoS (â€œStateful saturationâ€)\r\nHighly effective loudness compensated auto gain control\r\nStereo, mono and sum/difference (mid/side) processing options\r\nFrequency magnitude plot\r\nTool-bar with undo/redo, A/B, advanced preset management and more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INSTALLATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\r\nDelete old licenses for your sake.\r\n\r\n[WIN]\r\n%APPDATA%RoamingTokyo Dawn Labs*.conf\r\n%APPDATA%RoamingTokyo Dawn Labs*.tdr\r\n\r\n[OSX]\r\n~/Library/Tokyo Dawn Labs.conf\r\n~/Library/Tokyo Dawn Labs.tdr\r\n\r\n2.Install the plugin.\r\n\r\n3.Register with keygen or pre-generated *.tdr licenses.\r\n\r\n4.Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAM R2R 2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Thats it!
