He wrote a series of etude books for the violin which are still in common use today.\n\nBorn in Hamburg, he received his first violin lessons from his father, and made his first public appearance at the age of six. He studied under Hubert LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©onard, in Brussels, where he gained first prize. Afterwards he went to Leipzig, where he became a pupil of Ferdinand David. In 1863 he became a soloist at the Reinthaler concerts at Bremen. The following year he went to Moscow as Professor of the violin. In 1868 Schradieck returned to Hamburg, to take up the position of conductor of the Philharmonic Society, vacated by Auer. After six years he became concertmaster at the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig, professor at the Leipzig Conservatory, and leader of the theater orchestra. His reputation as a teacher became very great and his duties very onerous.\n\nExercises for promoting dexterity in Various Positions:\n\n    * Exercises on One String\n    * Exercises on Two Strings\n    * Exercises to be practised with wrist-movement only, keeping the right arm  \n      perfectly quiet\n    * Exercise on Three Strings\n    * Exericses on Four Strings\n    * Exercises in the Second Position\n    * Exercises in the First and Second Positions\n    * Exercises in the Third Positions\n    * Exercises in the First, Second and Third Positions\n    * Exercises in the Fourth Position\n    * Exercises in the First-Fourth Positions\n    * Exercises in the Fifth Position\n    * Exercises passing through Five Positions\n    * Exercises in the Sixth Position\n    * Exercises passing through Six Positions\n    * Exercises in the Seventh Position","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f219f6ca08b12a0a9f41cd631eb8c767b05a9a","amp;dn":"Schradieck+School+of+Violin+Technics-Book.1%28Dexterity%29Public+dom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f219f6ca08b12a0a9f41cd631eb8c767b05a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,242,25,246,202,8,177,42,10,159,65,205,99,30,184,199,103,176,90,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
