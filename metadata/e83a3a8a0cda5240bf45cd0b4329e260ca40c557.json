It has been updated to take account of changes introduced by BS 7671 : 2001 and Amendment 1 to the standard which included a new table of current-carrying capacities.\n\nThe book makes extensive use of worked examples with the minimum discussion of theory. Chapters cover:\n- cross-sectional areas of circuit live conductors\n- voltage drop under normal load conditions\n- earth fault loop impedances\n- protective conductor cross-sectional areas\n- short circuit conditions\n\nThe final chapter combines all the calculations of the previous chapters, to enable the reader to achieve the complete design of a circuit.\n\nPublished on behalf of the Electrical Contractors' Association, the book filled a significant gap when it was first published. It will continue to be invaluable for all electrical contractors, as well as for plant engineers and students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83a3a8a0cda5240bf45cd0b4329e260ca40c557","amp;dn":"Electrical+Installation+Calculations%2C+3rd+Edition+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83a3a8a0cda5240bf45cd0b4329e260ca40c557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,58,58,138,12,218,82,64,191,69,205,11,67,41,226,96,202,64,197,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
