It is about a contemporary terrorist group who set out to continue the work of the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang. The group consists of several young men, and a female leader named Gudrun (after Gudrun Ensslin). All of the characters are named after original members of the Baader-Meinhof Gang or revolutionaries such as Che Guevara.\n\nThey call themselves the \\&quot;Sixth Generation of the Baader-Meinhof Gang\\&quot; and \\&quot;The Raspberry Reich\\&quot;. \\&quot;Reich\\&quot; is a reference to communist sexologist Wilhelm Reich. In addition, the term \\&quot;Raspberry Reich\\&quot; was coined by RAF leader Gudrun Ensslin to refer to the oppression of consumer society.[3] An \\&quot;uncut\\&quot; version of the film has been released, titled The Revolution Is My Boyfriend, edited by the gay pornographic film company Cazzo Film including erotic scenes edited out in the original version.
