To help students gain a better understanding of the specific statistical hypothesis tests that are covered throughout the text, author David Howell emphasize conceptual understanding. Along with a significantly updated discussion of effect sizes and examples on how to write up the results of data analysis, this Sixth Edition continues to focus students on two key themes that are the cornerstones of this book's success: the importance of looking at the data before beginning a hypothesis test, and the importance of knowing the relationship between the statistical test in use and the theoretical questions being asked by the experiment.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid C.
