The good news is the rest of the westÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise is still on schedule. The bad news is America has now signed up for the same program, supersized. And, unlike AIG, Fannie Mae, Detroit and Greece, the United States is big enough to fail, and spectacularly so. If, like Mark, you want to avoid that fate, then After America is the book for you. It starts with the money, because it always does - for Washington, as for London and Rome before it. But it ends with a ruined and reprimitivized planet - and even liberals won't like that as much as they think.\n\nIf you enjoyed Mark's last apocalyptic blockbuster, you'll appreciate this one even more. From budgets to the border, diversity to disease, manufacturing to manhood, Steyn looks at the American undreaming, and provides a glimpse of the post-American world. There's laughs along the way, and a few suggestions as to how total civilizational collapse might be avoided.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e7b856b9d25c24ad5d5e4aeff2c843cb62be28","amp;dn":"Mark+Steyn+-+After+America%2C+Get+Ready+For+Armageddon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e7b856b9d25c24ad5d5e4aeff2c843cb62be28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,231,184,86,185,210,92,36,173,93,94,74,239,242,200,67,203,98,190,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
