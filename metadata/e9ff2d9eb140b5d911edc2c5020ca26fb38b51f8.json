Mr. Hoffman approaches mathematics as a storyteller, and a good one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ The New York Times Book Review\n\nAmazon.com Review:\n\nArchimedesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Revenge is an extremely accessible, lighthearted account of a number of mathematical topics, many with modern interest, such as complexity theory. Hoffman quotes living mathematicians extensively, giving the reader a feel for the nature of the mathematical community and insight into how this community attempts to resolve open questions. This book is low in mathematical rigor, making it suitable for any interested reader.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ff2d9eb140b5d911edc2c5020ca26fb38b51f8","amp;dn":"Archimedes%27+Revenge%3A+The+Joys+and+Perils+of+Mathematics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ff2d9eb140b5d911edc2c5020ca26fb38b51f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,255,45,158,177,64,181,217,17,237,194,197,2,12,162,111,179,139,81,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
