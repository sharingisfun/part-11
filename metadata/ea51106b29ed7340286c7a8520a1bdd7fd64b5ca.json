The album features sleevenotes written by the band's former press officer and compere, Phill Jupitus, and serves as a companion to the previously released BBC session tracks included on the 1988 compilation album &quot;Now That's What I Call Quite Good&quot;. With the exception of track 1, &quot;Drop Down Dead&quot;, all of the recordings included on the disc are exclusive to this album..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Drop Down Dead\n[02] Flag Day\n[03] Stand At Ease\n[04] Reverends Revenge\n[05] Shelter\n[06] People Get Ready\n[07] Over There\n[08] Caravan Of Love\n[09] Happy Hour\n[10] Heaven Help Us All\n[11] Pickin' The Blues (Peel Show Theme Tune)\n[12] Mercy\n[13] So Glad\n[14] He Brought Me Out\n[15] Sunday Isn't Sunday\n[16] Build\n[17] We're Not Deep\n[18] Me And The Farmer\n[19] The People Who Grinned Themselves To Death\n[20] The Light Is Always Green\n[21] The World's On Fire\n[22] We're Not Going Back\n[23] Johannesburg\n[24] Five Get Over Excited\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:11m:11s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 168mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
