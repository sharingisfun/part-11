Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-recordings-r224144&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-recordings-r224144&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033BY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033BY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
