A mix of chant styles and compositions by modern composers. \n\nAncient and Monastic Orthodox Chants (Drevnerousski Rospev). Concentrates on ancient Russian chant, znamenny and demestvenny. \n\nAncient Echoes (Chorovaya Akademia). Way over-produced but cool collection of pieces by 20th century composers.\n\nFeast of the Transfiguration. By the Byzantine Catholic monks of the dual-rite Monastery of Chevetogne.\n\nGeorgian Sacred Music, Georgian Voices, Sacred and Ritual Music of Georgia. Collections of Georgian liturgical and folk song.\n\nMatins of the Resurrection (Schola Cantorum of St Peter the Apostle). Carpatho-Russian chant in English.\n\nPutnik (Ensemble Sirine). Medieval Russian religious folksong. Deep and powerful stuff.\n\nRakhmaninov Divine Liturgy (Kansas City Chorale of all people!) A great rendition. Very beautiful. \n\nSeven Days of Passion. Settings of Holy Week hymns by Grechaninov, a prominent 20th century composer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea88c22778a1227e8382401e12ba67e6693d88dd","amp;dn":"Russian+and+Georgian+Church+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea88c22778a1227e8382401e12ba67e6693d88dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,136,194,39,120,161,34,126,131,130,64,30,18,186,103,230,105,61,136,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
