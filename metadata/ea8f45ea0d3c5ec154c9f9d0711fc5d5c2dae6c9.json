Are our bodies and brains truly at odds with modern life? Although it may seem as though we have barely had time to shed our hunter-gatherer legacy, biologist Marlene Zuk reveals that the story is not so simple. Popular theories about how our ancestors livedÃ¢â‚¬â€and why we should emulate themÃ¢â‚¬â€are often based on speculation, not scientific evidence.\nArmed with a razor-sharp wit and brilliant, eye-opening research, Zuk takes us to the cutting edge of biology to show that evolution can work much faster than was previously realized, meaning that we are not biologically the same as our caveman ancestors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea8f45ea0d3c5ec154c9f9d0711fc5d5c2dae6c9","amp;dn":"Paleofantasy%3A+What+Evolution+Really+Tells+Us+about+Sex%2C+Diet%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea8f45ea0d3c5ec154c9f9d0711fc5d5c2dae6c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,143,69,234,13,60,94,193,84,201,249,208,113,31,197,213,194,218,230,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
