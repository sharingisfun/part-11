Lydon is the sole constant member of the band.\nLydon emerged after the break-up of the Sex Pistols with PiL's Public Image: First Issue (1978). His new band had a more experimental sound: Wobble's &quot;droning, slow-tempo, bass-heavy noise rock, overlaid by Lydon's distinctive, vituperative rant&quot;.[1] Their early work is often regarded as some of the most challenging and innovative music of the post-punk era. Their 1979 album Metal Box was ranked number 469 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The NME described PiL as &quot;arguably the first post-rock group&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy PiL :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf7d4e6f0741ac1928315e739f7c829c2733301","amp;dn":"Public+Image+Ltd.+-+5+Albums+1981+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+%5Bh33t%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf7d4e6f0741ac1928315e739f7c829c2733301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,247,212,230,240,116,26,193,146,131,21,231,57,247,200,41,194,115,51,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
