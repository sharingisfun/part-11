India's peoples range from technocrats to hunter-gathers and its environments from dense forest to wasteland. The bookanalyses the use and abuse of nature on the sub-continent to reveal the interconnections of social and environmental conflict on the global scale. The authors argue that the root of this conflict is competition within different social groups and between different economic interests for natural resources.\nRadical both in its critique of the causes of crisis in India and in its proposals for ecological reform, Ecology and Equity is essential reading for all concerned for the Third World's in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0c982b6c1b6b5512daf99b5a447dee088df107","amp;dn":"Ecology+and+Equity+%28Gadgil+and+Guha%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0c982b6c1b6b5512daf99b5a447dee088df107","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,12,152,43,108,27,107,85,18,218,249,155,90,68,125,238,8,141,241,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
