Brands CEO David Novak learned long ago that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lead a great organization of any size without getting your people aligned, enthusiastic, and focused relentlessly on \n\nthe mission. But how do you do that? There are countless leadership books, but how many will actually help a Taco Bell shift manager, a Fortune 500 CEO, a new entrepreneur, or \n\nanyone in between? \n\nOver his fifteen years at Yum! Brands, Novak has developed a trademarked programÃ¢â‚¬â€Taking People with YouÃ¢â‚¬â€that he personally teaches to thousands of managers around the world. He \n\nshows them how to make big things happen by getting people on their side. No skill in business is more important. And Yum!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary success (at least 13 percent growth \n\nfor each of the last ten years) proves his point. \n\nNovak knows that managers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need leadership platitudes or business school theories. So he cuts right to the chase with a step-by-step guide to setting big goals, building \n\nstrong teams, blowing past your targets, and celebrating after you shock the skeptics. And then doing it again and again until consistent excellence becomes a core element of \n\nyour culture. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb62fafc709856cac2cdfb78ccb0a300fafe24ef","amp;dn":"Taking+People+With+You-+David+Novak+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb62fafc709856cac2cdfb78ccb0a300fafe24ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,98,250,252,112,152,86,202,194,205,251,120,204,176,163,0,250,254,36,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
