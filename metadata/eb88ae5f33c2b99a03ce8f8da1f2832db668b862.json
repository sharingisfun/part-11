Most people are familiar with tales of cocaine being an early ingredient of &quot;Coke&quot; tonic; it's an era the company makes every effort to bury. Yet coca leaf, the source of cocaine which has been banned in the U.S. since 1914, has been part of Coca-Cola's secret formula for over one hundred years\n\nAbout the Author\nRicardo CortÃƒÂ©s is best known for illustrating the number one New York Times best-selling Go the Fuck to Sleep and the G-rated follow-up Seriously, Just Go to Sleep.
