IF it is personal or confidential, it NEEDS protection!\nFiles and folders left unprotected can lead to theft, data-loss, and breaches of your privacy, costing you embarrassment, money, lost data, and maybe even your job!\nFolder Lock uses government-level 256-bit AES encryption for protecting your files. Unlike slow encryption programs, the program uses on-the-fly encryption, a technology that takes seconds to encrypt - even GBs of data. Using this technology, when Folder Lock opens the data contained in a Locker, it does not decrypt each and every file. Rather, only those files and folders are decrypted; that need access. And since files are decrypted into RAM instead of the Hard Disk, this gives you an added security benefit because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1) Recovery of files is not possible from the Hard Disk, as there was nothing there in the first place; and 2) Data decrypted in RAM is cleared automatically after a system shutdown or restart.\nFollowing is a list of the comprehensive and award-winning features and benefits that have made Folder Lock a revolutionary product in data protection and security.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ THE most comprehensive data protection and online backup suite.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Caters to the ever-growing data protection and storage needs in today's digital environment.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Option to either Encrypt or Lock, choices useful for both power users and casual users.

All locked items are listed in 'Lock Files'. This list not only helps to organize viewing of your Locked files, but also allows you to quickly edit files, with options to enable/disable the protection per item according to requirements. This removes the hassle of having to unlock and unhide each file and folder separately.\n\nImportant!\n\nEven though locking is fast, it is strongly advised to consider encryption for your most important data.\nFolder Lock is also one of the best data protection tools for protecting all your portable devices. USB Flash Drives, external hard drives, pen drives, Zip drives, floppy disks, even CDs/DVDs-RWs.

Additionally, select 'Move/Copy Locker' to move/copy an existing Locker to your external drive.
