Do women have better poker faces than men? Whats the most existential poker movie ever made? Is life more meaningful when you go all-in? Is online poker really still poker? \n\nPoker and Philosophy ponders these questions and more, pitting young lions against old masters as the brashness of Phil Hellmuth meets the arrogance of Socrates, the recklessness of Doyle Brunson challenges the desperation of Dostoyevsky, and the coolness of Chris Moneymaker takes on the American tradition of capitalist ingenuity. \n\nThis witty collection of essays demonstrates what serious card sharks have long known: winning big takes more than a good hand and a straight face. Stacking the metaphorical deck with a serious grounding in philosophy is the key to raking it in, because as Machiavelli proved long ago, its a lot better to be feared than loved, and lying is not the same as cheating.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , Philosophy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc3a0e7be01ac6db329430296a66b12847e27a5","amp;dn":"Poker+and+Philosophy+by+Eric+Bronson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc3a0e7be01ac6db329430296a66b12847e27a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,195,160,231,190,1,172,109,179,41,67,2,150,166,107,18,132,126,39,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
