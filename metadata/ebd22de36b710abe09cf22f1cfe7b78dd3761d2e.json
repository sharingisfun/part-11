Despite being Soviet propaganda at its time the film is really fascinating considering the time of production.\nMany of the films revolutionary features became standard, specially when Hollywood discovered the techniques used a decade later. The Odessa steps scene still serves as an example of excellent cinematography.\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN said it was his favourite movie.\n\n--------------------------------\nThis is for film enthuastics --ONLY--. Nobody else will probably have any interest in and excitement about this film\n--------------------------------\n\nPlot Outline (imdb.com):\n\nBased on the historical events the movie tells the story of a riot at the battleship Potemkin. What started as a protest strike when the crew was given rotten meat for dinner ended in a riot. The sailors raised the red flag and tried to ignite the revolution in their home port Odessa.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nNOTICE: I can only upload at a maximum of 32 kb/s.
