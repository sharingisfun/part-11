We hope that your work will lead to a product you can commercialise. If this is the case, before you can sell your work or your game, you must seek a development license for CryENGINE 3. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll offer a royalty-only license model for Independent Developers, where Crytek require only 20% of the developerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revenues from the commercial launch of their game.\n\nCryENGINE 3 for Independent Studios, Free To Play Games or Downloadable Games\nCrytek has attractive options for smaller games built with CryENGINE 3, with shorter development timescales. If you want to move your game onto platforms other than PC, or you need access to CryENGINE 3 source code, please contact Crytek to find out more about our licensing for Independent Studios. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd761b92a4d035f550aa7810ce005a0b269fbd1","amp;dn":"CryEngine+V3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd761b92a4d035f550aa7810ce005a0b269fbd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,215,97,185,42,77,3,95,85,10,167,129,12,224,5,160,178,105,251,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
