The 2 discs include highlights cherry-picked from 3 nights, mostly the last night (9/16).\n\nSorry, I don't have the bonus DVD that came with this set.\n\nVery goofy stuff, mastered so it sounds like it was recorded last week. It sounds best played loud through headphones.\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nDisc One\n01 Jack Straw\n02 Row Jimmy\n03 New, New Minglewood Blues\n04 Candyman\n05 Looks Like Rain\n06 Stagger Lee\n07 I Need A Miracle\n08 It's All Over Now\n09 Deal\n\nDisc Two\n01 Ollin Arageed (with Hamza El Din and Nubian Youth Choir)\n02 Fire On The Mountain\n03 Iko Iko\n04 Shakedown Street\n05 Drums\n06 Space\n07 Truckin'\n08 Stella Blue\n09 Around and Around\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec420a53a14ad006492078699c6d729b22c6b1d1","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Rocking+the+Cradle+-+Egypt+1978+%28Rhino%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec420a53a14ad006492078699c6d729b22c6b1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,66,10,83,161,74,208,6,73,32,120,105,156,109,114,155,34,198,177,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
