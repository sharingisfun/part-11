On the album, Getz embraced the rapidly expanding fusion sub-genre of the jazz world, but he succeeded where many other jazz-rock hybrids failed, largely by utilizing the same loose, organic approach that Miles Davis did on his legendary outings of the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s.\n\nWhile some other players of his generation were content to do (and re-do) what they'd done in the past, Getz got together with some of the best cutting-edge talent, all of whom (Chick Corea, Tony Williams, Airto Moreira) had been in the bands of fellow legend Miles Davis. Also featured is Stanley Clarke, here only 20 years old and about to become one of the jazz fusion movement's biggest stars. \n\nExcept for the lovely Billy Strayhorn ballad Lush Life, all the compositions are by Corea, and would later on be heard in his own Return to Forever band.\n \nThere's an infectious, joyous, Latin-tinged lilt to the tunes, which inspires Getz to some of the best playing of his career. His tone retains the &quot;cool&quot; by which he's been characterized - but he blows hot, too. Getz's playing on 500 Miles High is focused ferocity.\n \nThis album is one of Getz's (and Corea's) best. \n\n\nSTAN GETZ\n\nCaptain Marvel    1972\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 La Fiesta \n2 Five Hundred Miles High \n3 Captain Marvel \n4 Times Lie  \n5 Lush Life \n6 Day Waves \n\nBonus Tracks :\n\n7 Crystal Silence (*)\n8 Captain Marvel (alternate take)\n9 Five Hundred Miles High (alternate take)\n\n\nPersonnel: \nStan Getz, tenor saxophone\nChick Corea, Fender Rhodes piano\nStanley Clarke, acoustic bass\nTony Williams, drums\nAirto Moreira, percussion\n\n\nRecorded at A&amp;R Studios, New York, on March 3, 1972\n\n\nThis release of Captain Marvel was remastered and augmented with a trio of bonus cuts that include two stellar alternate takes (Five Hundred Miles High and the title track) plus a sterling interpretation of CoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant Crystal Silence.\nEven without the extra material, however, this album is a jazz masterpiece, one that turns Miles DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ new direction on its ear, mutating it into a wide-sweeping forum for the saxophone.\n\n:)\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd3f86750a1952c2093ea22749db291d99ed135","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+-+Captain+Marvel+1972+%27Expanded+2003%27+-+320Kbps+%23+DrBn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd3f86750a1952c2093ea22749db291d99ed135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,211,248,103,80,161,149,44,32,147,234,34,116,157,178,145,217,158,209,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
