Using examples from her private practice over fifteen years, Jenson demonstrates that twelve-step and similar programs, as well as traditional therapies, do not fully deal with the phenomenon of repressed pain. Until this pain is &quot;processed&quot; - retrieved from the unconscious, fully experienced, and grieved over - she believes adults will still be trapped in the patterns of childhood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecda128ce1d35ac09ab090dd2c832fb6f45c669e","amp;dn":"Jean+Jenson+-+Reclaiming+your+life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecda128ce1d35ac09ab090dd2c832fb6f45c669e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,218,18,140,225,211,90,192,154,176,144,221,44,131,47,182,244,92,102,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
