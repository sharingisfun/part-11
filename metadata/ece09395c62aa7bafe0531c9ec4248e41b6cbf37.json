A year later, survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting.\n\nIMDB      : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257106/\nWikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Movie_2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece09395c62aa7bafe0531c9ec4248e41b6cbf37","amp;dn":"Scary+Movie+2+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece09395c62aa7bafe0531c9ec4248e41b6cbf37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,224,147,149,198,42,167,186,254,5,49,201,236,66,72,228,27,108,191,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
