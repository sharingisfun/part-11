It is the first live album to feature Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks together, although both had appeared separately on previous live albums. It was recorded during the group's annual Beacon Theatre run in New York City on March 25 and 26, 2003, and released a year later.\n\nThe album features extended jams and guitar solos that showcase the virtuosity of Trucks and Haynes. While the original Allman Brothers Band focused both on jazz-based soloing and looser free jamming, the more modern version of the band is loud and tight throughout. Trucks and Haynes show a great respect for the legacy of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts while still managing to do something original with their guitars.\n\nOne Way Out [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n   1. &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; (McTell) - 5:22\n   2. &quot;Don't Keep Me Wonderin'&quot; (Allman) - 4:12\n   3. &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; (Allman, Payne) - 3:16\n   4. &quot;Rockin' Horse&quot; (Allman, Haynes, Pearson, Woody) - 10:12\n   5. &quot;Desdemona&quot; (Allman, Haynes) - 13:27\n   6. &quot;Trouble No More&quot; (Waters) - 3:45\n   7. &quot;Wasted Words&quot; (Allman) - 7:51\n   8. &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; (Williamson) - 9:01\n   9. &quot;Instrumental Illness&quot; (Burbridge, Haynes) - 16:42 (w/ 5:36 drum solo)\n\nDisc 2\n\n   1. &quot;Ain't Wastin' Time No More&quot; (Allman) - 6:29\n   2. &quot;Come and Go Blues&quot; (Allman) - 6:03\n   3. &quot;Woman Across the River&quot; (Crutcher, Jones) - 6:38\n   4. &quot;Old Before My Time&quot; (Allman, Haynes) - 5:37\n   5. &quot;Every Hungry Woman&quot; (Allman) - 5:21\n   6. &quot;High Cost of Low Living&quot; (Allman, Anders, Burgin, Haynes) - 8:42\n   7. &quot;Worried Down with the Blues&quot; (Haynes, Woody) - 7:58\n   8. &quot;Dreams&quot; (Allman) - 12:49\n   9. &quot;Whipping Post&quot; (Allman) - 15:31\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band\n\n    * Gregg Allman - Hammond B-3 organ, piano, acoustic guitar, lead vocals\n    * Jaimoe - drums (left side)\n    * Butch Trucks - drums (right side)\n    * Warren Haynes - lead and slide guitars (right side), lead and background vocals\n    * Marc Quinones - congas, percussion, background vocals\n    * Oteil Burbridge - bass\n    * Derek Trucks - lead and slide guitars (left side)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece9393d61c7cfe58cd5c50982f389bdeba9ab11","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+One+Way+Out+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece9393d61c7cfe58cd5c50982f389bdeba9ab11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,233,57,61,97,199,207,229,140,213,197,9,130,243,137,189,235,169,171,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
