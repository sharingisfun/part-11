Highlighting todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best practices, the authors show how to use both the core language and its standard library to write efficient, readable, and powerful code. C++ Primer, Fifth Edition, introduces the C++ standard library from the outset, drawing on its common functions and facilities to help you write useful programs without first having to master every language detail. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many examples have been revised to use the new language features and demonstrate how to make the best use of them. \n\nTitle: C++ Primer, 5th Edition\nAuthor(s): Stanley B.
