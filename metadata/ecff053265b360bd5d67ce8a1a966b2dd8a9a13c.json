A \n\nCovenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn. Captain Keyes initiates &quot;The Cole Protocol&quot;, a \n\nprocedure designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth. While Keyes prepares to land the \n\nship on Halo, the Master Chief and Cortana escape via an escape pod, which crash lands on the ring. Cortana and the \n\nChief are the only ones who survive the impact of the escape pod crash.\nKeyes survives the Autumn's crash landing, but is captured by the Covenant. In the second and third levels of the \n\ngame, the Master Chief and Cortana gather human survivors and rescue Captain Keyes, who is imprisoned aboard the \n\nCovenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Once rescued, Keyes orders the Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo's \n\ncontrol center and to discover its purpose. The Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent \n\nCartographer, which leads them to the control room. There, Cortana enters the systems and, discovering something \n\nurgent, suddenly sends the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind. While searching for his \n\ncommander, the Master Chief learns that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood, a parasitic alien race \n\ncapable of spreading itself by overwhelming and infesting other sentient life-forms. Keyes falls victim to them \n\nwhile looking for a cache of weapons. The release of the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to \n\nrecruit the Master Chief in retrieving the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from \n\nspreading beyond the facility.\nAfter the Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the \n\nactivation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the \n\ngalaxy, which the Flood requires to spread,a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.\nFaced with this information, the Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While \n\nfighting the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers that the best way to accomplish \n\nthis is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct.However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to \n\ndestroy the Autumn,forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to \n\nsearch for him. By the time that they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by \n\nthe Flood. The Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, \n\nwhere Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the \n\ncountdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. The Master Chief manually destabilizes the \n\nPillar of Autumn's fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter.\n\n[/i][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::PC Requirements::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][color=red]Minimum Requirements[/color]: [i]\nCPU:\tPC with 733 MHz equivalent or higher processor\t\nRAM:\t128 MB of system RAM\t\nVGA:\t32 MB T&amp;L capable video card required\t\nOS:\tMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98SE/Me/XP/2000\t\nHDD:\t1.2 GB available hard disk space\t\nSound:\tSound card, speakers or headphones required for audio\t\nODD:\t8x speed or faster CD-ROM drive\t\nNetwork:\t56.6 Kbps or better modem or LAN for online play; broadband to run a server\t\nRecommended peripheral:\tMicrosoft Mouse or compatible pointing device[/i][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Installation Instructions::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][color=red][i]How to Install Halo\n\n1&gt; Mount halo.iso using Daemon Tools.\n\n2&gt; Then use the following CD key to install the game - dlksafjweilfjwkjghwekf\n\n3&gt; Copy and replace the original file with the file in the crack folder.\n\n\n\nIf u want to play online then you need to update.[/i][/color][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Trackers::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][code] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\n\n[/code][/b]\n[b][color=red]Info Hash[/color]:[i]ECFF053265B360BD5D67CE8A1A966B2DD8A9A13C[/i][/b] \n\n\n[img]http://images.wikia.com/halo/images/d/da/1220238670_Menu.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://static.computergames.ro/cg/assassin/images/halo/halo062.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.counterfrag.com/screenshots/halo/2.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/114978-halo-combat-evolved-windows-screenshot-the-master-chief-\n\ntalks.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.programlar.com/files/img/prg/prg/64/12564/halo-combat-evolved,2,out.jpg[/img]\n\n(Note:The size of the screenshots may vary since i have taken it directly from the Internet.)\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iyXzMn9tYeK00.gif[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibg1o6jMcgIhji.png[/img][/center]\n\nWe are now also on FaceBook.
