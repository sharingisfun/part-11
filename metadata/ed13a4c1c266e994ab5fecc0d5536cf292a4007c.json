The original lineup of Alcatrazz featured two master guitarists before anyone outside of LA had heard of them. First up is a very young Yngwie Malmsteen, and to hear Yngwie's playing in a power-pop/metal band context is interesting...as is how developed his trademark style was even back then. Six of the songs feature Yngwie, including one of Alcatrazz's two pseudo-memorable originals (&quot;Island in the Sun&quot;) and three live songs including versions of Bonnet's oft-rerecorded two semi-hits with Rainbow (&quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; and &quot;All Night Long&quot;). To me, the live stuff with Malmsteen is worth the price of admission, but you also get several solid songs with a young fretboard burner and whammy-bar fanatic called Steve Vai...Vai was Yngwie's replacement post-Zappa before the DLR and Whitesnake gigs which led up to his eventual solo popularity. Following Vai's departure to work with Dave, Alcatrazz got a third shredder who remained obscure...before slipping ocne and forever into the dustbin of metal history around 1986-87. Bonnet went on to work with (Chris)Impelliteri -- and, tellingly, the best song they came up with was &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; version fiveor six. The complete Alcatrazz albums are fairly weak as well as hard to find, but a tiny label with the band's bassist involved in this project has put together a highly worthwhile and easy-to-acquire recap. Dated, yes. Cheeseball, you bet. But if you were 12-18 in 1983, or you've become a fan of Malmsteen or Vai since then, you will like this. \r\n\r\nTrack List\r\n\r\n1 \tIsland In The Sun \t\r\n2 \tGeneral Hospital \t\r\n3 \tHiroshima Mon Amour \t\r\n4 \tAll Night Long (Live) \t\r\n5 \tSince You've Been Gone (Live) \t\r\n6 \tNight Games \t\r\n7 \tStripper \t\r\n8 \tPainted Lover \t\r\n9 \tSons And Lovers \t\r\n10 \tGod Blessed Video \t\r\n11 \tMercy \t\r\n12 \tIt's My Life \t\r\n13 \tDangerous Games \t\r\n14 \tUndercover \t\r\n15 \tNo Imagination","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed13a4c1c266e994ab5fecc0d5536cf292a4007c","amp;dn":"Alcatrazz+%281996%29+-+The+Best+of+Alcatrazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed13a4c1c266e994ab5fecc0d5536cf292a4007c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,19,164,193,194,102,233,148,171,95,236,192,213,83,108,242,146,164,0,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
