Mathias told Leon that the monsters were related to a vampire named Walter Bernhard who lived in a castle in a forest named &amp;#039;Eternal Night&amp;#039;. Mathias said Leon&amp;#039;s betrothed, Sara Trantoul, was kidnapped by this vampire and brought to his castle. Leon traveled to this forest to slay the vampire. In the forest he met Rinaldo Gandolfi, an old alchemist who lived there. Rinaldo gave Leon a whip crafted by alchemy to assist him. Thanking him, Leon left with the Whip of Alchemy.\n\nWhen Leon reached WalterÃƒÂ¢??s quarters, he rescued Sara and tried to slay Walter with the whip. Unfortunately, it had no effect on Walter, so Leon was forced to flee. Concerned, Leon took Sara back to Rinaldo&amp;#039;s cottage. But after examining her, Rinaldo discovered bite marks on her neck. According to Rinaldo, the only way to undo the curse was to defeat Walter. Rinaldo knew a way to make LeonÃƒÂ¢??s whip effective against Walter, but it involved killing Sara. Knowing that she was changing into a vampire, she volunteered to be sacrificed if it would stop others from suffering the same curse. Despite Leon&amp;#039;s objections, he reluctantly completed the ritual. The Vampire Killer was created.\n\nLeon ran into the Castle&amp;#039;s Keep and confronted Walter. After Leon defeated Walter, Mathias appeared. Mathias had used everyone and orchestrated everything that happened to get Walter out of the way. After his wife died, Mathias felt betrayed by God. He defied mortal life and forever cursed God. Mathias then offered Leon to join him. Leon refused, vowing that he and his family would do all in their power to destroy Mathias.\n\nMathias escaped to foreign lands. Eventually, he would become known as &amp;#039;Dracula&amp;#039;, the series&amp;#039; main antoganist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed49d49cdb6fad9cf4e3e12fb6b19d0225fc13ed","amp;dn":"Castlevania+%3A+Lament+of+Innocence+%28PS2%29+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed49d49cdb6fad9cf4e3e12fb6b19d0225fc13ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,73,212,156,219,111,173,156,244,227,225,47,182,177,157,2,37,252,19,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
