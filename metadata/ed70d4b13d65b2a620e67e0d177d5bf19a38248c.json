It is very interesting to watch, and a good way to learn what Americans thought (or were supposed to think) at the time - but on its own this series does not provide an accurate account of the war.\n\nObviously, this was made before political correctness existed, and you can tell: there is talk of 'Japs', the Holocaust is largely ignored. Also, the movie is necessarily ambivalent about the Russian role, who were allies at the time. For example, the Molotov-Von Ribbentrop pact (especially the annex about the division of Eastern Europe) goes virtually unmentioned, and the Red Army's reasons for showing up in Eastern Poland are nebulous.\n\nOn the other hand, the movies are quite detailed about the people involved, the various Nazi leaders and so on - who would have been household names at the time, but would probably be left out of present day WWII documentaries. Also interesting is that one of the reasons, apparently, why Nazism must be fought was their union busting - surely a reflection of the post-Depression Roosevelt era.\n\nAll in all, well worth watching. I rate this highly both because it is essential viewing as an historical document, and because it is very well done propaganda (Frank Capra, animations by Disney)! Note that the US government has placed these movies in the public space, which means that perfectly legal, digital versions can be found on the internet. \n\n\nLanguage: English and German\nSubtitles: Deutsch, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese\n\n\nFile Name .........................................:\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 470,900,736 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 52:26.141\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 512x400 (AR: 1.280)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1084 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.177 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 100 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed70d4b13d65b2a620e67e0d177d5bf19a38248c","amp;dn":"Why+We+Fight+-+WW+II+-+Prelude+to+War+-+Frank+Capra+-+1943","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed70d4b13d65b2a620e67e0d177d5bf19a38248c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,112,212,177,61,101,178,166,32,230,126,13,23,125,91,241,154,56,36,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
