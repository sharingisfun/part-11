Their correct use is important for delivering high quality acoustics.\n\nUnique and authoritative, this book describes how to effectively measure, model, design and apply diffusers and absorbers. It is a resource for new and experienced acousticians, seeking an understanding of the evolution, characteristics and application of modern diffusers. Absorption is a more established technology and so the book blends traditional designs with modern developments. The book covers practical and theoretical aspects of absorbers and diffusers and is well illustrated with examples of installations and case studies.\n\nThis new edition brings Acoustic Absorbers and Diffusers up-to-date with current research, practice and standards. New developments in measurement, materials, theory and practice since the first edition (published in 2004) are included. The sections on absorbers are extended to include more about noise control.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 496 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (March 13, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0415471745\nISBN-13: 978-0415471749","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edbfd73794dbac30ffa460d9b0f4d8054697c263","amp;dn":"Acoustic+Absorbers+and+Diffusers%2C+Cox+and+D%27Antonio%2C+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edbfd73794dbac30ffa460d9b0f4d8054697c263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,191,215,55,148,219,172,48,255,164,96,217,176,244,216,5,70,151,194,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
