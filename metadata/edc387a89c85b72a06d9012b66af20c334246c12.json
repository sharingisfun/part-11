The contents have been carefully matched to provide full coverage of the appropriate units in the new BTEC Higher National Engineering scheme from Edexcel.\n\n\n\nIan Hickman is looked to by thousands of circuit designers for his innovative design ideas and clear explanations of the fundamentals of analog circuit design. This book is a distillation of Hickman's design insights, introducing all the main areas of analog electronics.\n\nTHE professional text for analog electronics\nIncludes numerous practical circuit ideas\n\nFrom the Publisher\nAnalog Electronics is a vital book for all electronics designers to have to hand. It will answer nagging questions about core analog theory and design principles as well as offering practical design ideas.\n\nStudents at degree level will find in Analog Electronics an ideal course text. However, it does not have the feel of a textbook - this is the real thing - from a leading designer. For students with a practical bent and career aims in the industry this book will teach them the tricks of the trade that they will not learn in the classroom.
