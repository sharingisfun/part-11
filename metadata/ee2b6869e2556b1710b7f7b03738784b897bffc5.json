The songs and sounds are surprisingly contemporary, with covers of songs by John Phillips, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Bob Lind, as well as above-average originals by the group that mostly constitute a sincere effort to keep their sound up-to-date. As neither of these albums was ever reissued after their original release, this is effectively the first chance that most listeners will have had to hear these albums -- the audio quality is excellent, but the annotation is a bit non-specific, delving more into the era than the music. \n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9frxq8aldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9frxq8aldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Review for tracks: 01-11 - Livin' Above Your Head: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:w9frxq95ldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:w9frxq95ldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Review for tracks: 12-22 - Try Some Of This: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:d9ftxq95ldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:d9ftxq95ldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
