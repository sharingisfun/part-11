Angered by sanctions placed against its nuclear program, a rogue state is determined to release it. Their chosen method: one of the Black WidowsÃ¢â‚¬â€female suicide terrorists of Chechen descent with a deadly reputation for slaughter that rivals any other group.\n\nThe only thing standing in the Black WidowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way is the Taskforce, an extra-legal counterterrorism unit. Racing against time to prevent a global pandemic, Taskforce operator Pike Logan and his partner Jennifer Cahill follow the trail across Southeast Asia to the United States, only to learn that the enemy they face may not be the enemy they should fear.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Ready.
