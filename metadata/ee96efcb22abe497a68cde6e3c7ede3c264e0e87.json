Jean Batten became an international icon in the 1930s. A brave, beautiful woman, she made a number of heroic solo flights across the world. The newspapers couldn't get enough of her; and yet she suddenly slipped out of view, disappearing to the Caribbean with her mother and dying in obscurity in Majorca, buried in a pauper's grave. Fiona Kidman's enthralling novel delves into the life of this enigmatic woman, exploring mysteries and crafting a fascinating exploration of early flying, of mothers and daughters, and of fame and secrecy.\n\n\nNote: Tested chapter links using Calibre for PC, and ibooks for the epub file, and Kindle for Apple for the mobi file. \n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee96efcb22abe497a68cde6e3c7ede3c264e0e87","amp;dn":"The+Infinite+Air+ebook+by+Fiona+Kidman+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee96efcb22abe497a68cde6e3c7ede3c264e0e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,150,239,203,34,171,228,151,166,140,222,110,60,126,222,60,38,78,14,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
