Led by vocalist Rasputin Stoy, C.C.C.P. released their debut singles &quot;American-Soviets I&quot; and &quot;American-Soviets II&quot; in 1986, both hits in alternative dance clubs. Although C.C.C.P. received scant airplay in the U.S., they remained a favorite of club DJs throughout the &amp;#039;80s, and tracks like 1987&amp;#039;s &quot;Made in Russia&quot; and 1989&amp;#039;s &quot;United States of Europe&quot; further expanded the group&amp;#039;s following among post-punk partygoers. As with their electronic peers, C.C.C.P.&amp;#039;s records were frequently remixed, appearing in countless versions before the band finally released their first album, The World, in 1990. Two years later, Best of C.C.C.P.: 1985-1992 provided a summary of the mysterious group&amp;#039;s career. C.C.C.P. recorded The Hallucinogenic Toreador in 1992 and The Cosmos in 1996, neither of which had the impact of their earlier material. \n\n01 American-Soviets\n02 Save Me\n03 Liaison\n04 Digital Musicland\n05 Twilight\n06 All She Wants\n07 William\n08 Heaven Closed\n09 Intro\n10 Caravan\n11 Sound Innovator\n12 Made in Russia\n13 Orient Express\n14 Unoted States of Europe\n15 Don&amp;#039;t Kill the Rainforest\n16 Liquit Sky\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea50704afea6e678ced9e393b2ba97e073b4235","amp;dn":"CCCP+-+Best+of+CCCP+1985+-+1992+%5BSynthpop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea50704afea6e678ced9e393b2ba97e073b4235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,165,7,4,175,234,110,103,140,237,158,57,59,43,169,126,7,59,66,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
