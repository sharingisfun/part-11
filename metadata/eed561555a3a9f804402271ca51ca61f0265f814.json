This is his most important and significant album, with the influence of the psychedelia of USA and UK. With the traditional mix of the brasilian music (aka MPB) and external influence he made this great disc. Ronnie Von said one time that this is his first work without the pressure of the Record Label, and is such original until today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed561555a3a9f804402271ca51ca61f0265f814","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Von+-+A+M%26aacute%3Bquina+Voadora+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed561555a3a9f804402271ca51ca61f0265f814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,213,97,85,90,58,159,128,68,2,39,28,165,28,166,31,2,101,248,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
