Starring David Thewlis and Alison Steadman, this is the bittersweet tale of the growing relationship between Clive (Thewlis) and Joy (Sylvestra Le Touzel), told through a series of vignettes.  Those familiar with Mike Leigh's work will know what to expect, for the uninitiated expect a fairly bleak (though offset by humour) plot-light 'slice of life' drama.  Don't expect shootouts, explosions, naked female ninjas - those were saved for the director's cut ;-) - the imdb keywords for this are: &quot;Hairdresser | Pharmacy | Joke | Haircut | England&quot;.\n\nThis came as an extra with the recently released Mike Leigh boxset. From the looks of it, it was a last-minute extra as the quality is not great. No digital remastering here, this came straight from a (VHS?) tape source and included some minor tape roll (removed while encoding), while the soundtrack has some static hiss on it.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093961/\n\nSPECS:\n\nfilename:       Short.and.Curlies.1987.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nfilesize:       262,973,440\nvideo codec:    XviD ISO MPEG-4\nvideo bitrate:  1874kbps\nduration:       17m, 11.000s\nresolution:     640*432\nfps:            25.000\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  153kbps VBR\naudio channels: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1b8170e90b6c73f82744d345b429744fbc7411","amp;dn":"The+Short+%26+Curlies+%28Mike+Leigh%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef1b8170e90b6c73f82744d345b429744fbc7411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,27,129,112,233,11,108,115,248,39,68,211,69,180,41,116,79,188,116,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
