Now, Fury draws upon his hard-won combat experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and his gift for true-to-life storytellingÃ¢â‚¬â€to offer a brand-new series of thrillers that are as close to reality as readers can get.\nMeet Kolt Raynor. A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and dutyÃ¢â‚¬â€after a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey ordersÃ¢â‚¬â€one that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But RaynorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shot at redemption comes at a price.\n\n\n A shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home. What Raynor never expected was to uncover a sinister al Qaeda plot to capture a Black Site--a secret U.S.Ã‚Â­Ã‚Â­ prison--and destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trailÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and he will stop at nothing to make sure that RaynorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission is not accomplished.\n\n\nAn intense, gritty work of edge-of-your-seat suspense, Black Site is the first of what promises to be one of the most exciting fiction series of the new millennium.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                         Published -  January 31st 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef24727cf14c60eaf8783ba188c4b817ce82cbff","amp;dn":"Black+Site+by+Dalton+Fury+%28Delta+Force+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef24727cf14c60eaf8783ba188c4b817ce82cbff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,36,114,124,241,76,96,234,248,120,59,161,136,196,184,23,206,130,203,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
