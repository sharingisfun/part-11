The residents wonder if they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be better off in prison! Martha gets an idea: they shall commit a crime that will ensure convictionÃ¢â‚¬â€some type of financial crime, a small coup of some sort. They will give whatever they get to the poor and elderly. If Robin Hood could do it, so can they!\n\nWhat starts as a robbery attempt at a nearby luxury hotel escalates to art theft from a major museum, the culprits armed only with bolt cutters and high-tech walkers. The Mafia gets wind of these robberies, and suddenly the underworld has its eye on both the stolen paintings and the handiwork of The Genius. Soon the Senior League has both the law and the lawless at their heels.\n\nReview\n\n'A shining expression of how joyous life is.
