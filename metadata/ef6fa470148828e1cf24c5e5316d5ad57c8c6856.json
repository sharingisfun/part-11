The Jackson 5's infectious brand of funky pop-soul was a definite departure from the typically smooth, elegant Motown sound, as befitting the group's youth and the dawn of a new decade. That youth, coupled with the merchandising juggernaut that sprang up behind them, inevitably got them tagged a bubblegum group. But they were far more talented musically than that label would suggest, especially lead singer Michael, and their material, while sunny and upbeat, didn't pander to its audience. Solo careers and overexposure gradually weakened the Jackson 5, but their best music still holds up surprisingly well as some of the most vibrant mainstream pop/R&amp;B of its era.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Zip A Dee Doo Dah\n02.Nobody\n03.I Want You Back\n04.Can You Remember\n05.Standing In The Shadows Of Love\n06.You've Changed\n07.My Cherie Amour\n08.Who's Lovin' You\n09.Chained\n10.(I Know) I'm Losing You\n11.Stand!\n12.Born To Love You\n13.The Love You Save\n14.One More Chance\n15.ABC\n16.2-4-6-8\n17.(Come 'Round Here) I'm The One You Need\n18.Don't Know Why I Love You\n19.Never Had A Dream Come True\n20.True Love Can Be Beautiful\n21.La La (Means I Love You)\n22.I'll Bet You\n23.I Found That Girl\n24.The Young Folks\n25.Oh, I've Been Bless'd (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6fa470148828e1cf24c5e5316d5ad57c8c6856","amp;dn":"The+Jackson+5+-+Diana+Ross+Presents+%2B+ABC+%282001%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6fa470148828e1cf24c5e5316d5ad57c8c6856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,111,164,112,20,136,40,225,207,36,197,229,49,109,90,213,124,140,104,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
