He was born in Bethel, Germany, and studied law at West BerlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Free University.  Between 1987 and 2006 he was a judge at the constitutional court of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  Since his retirement from the bench in 2006, Schlink has taught public law and legal philosophy at Humboldt University in Berlin and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York.\n\nSchlink's career as a writer began with several detective novels with a main character named Selb (a play on the German word for &quot;self&quot;).  One of these, THE GORDIAN KNOT, won the Glauser Prize in 1989.\n\nIn 1995, he published THE READER (&quot;Der Vorleser&quot;), an international bestseller about a teenager who has an affair with a woman in her thirties who suddenly vanishes but whom he meets again as a law student when visiting a trial about war crimes.  Translated into 46 languages, it was the first German book to reach the number one position on the New York Times bestseller list and was adapted into a 2008 Oscar-winning film directed by Stephen Daldry.\n\n\nSeven novels and one short story collection are included here, all in EPUB format:\n\n* THE GORDIAN KNOT (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, 2010).
