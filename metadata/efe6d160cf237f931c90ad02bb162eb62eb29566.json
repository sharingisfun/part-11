Karl Beckman: Guitar, Vocals\nJonas Albrektsson: Bass\nLars G TÃƒÂ¤ngmark: Guitar\nKarsten Larsson: Drums\n\nKing of Asgard took form in 2008 by founder Karl Beckman, when he teamed up with long time fellow worker, Karsten Larsson, whom he had previously performed with in the well known viking horde Mithotyn. The duo worked on re-discovering their roots, thereby establing the foundation of King of Asgard, both musically as well as in the Norse heritage lyrical approach.\n\nIn January 2009, the first recording was done, resulting in the demo Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prince of MÃƒÂ¤ringsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a seven track disc recorded in Lotang studio. In November the same year, Jonas Albrektsson (ex-Thy Primordial) joined King of Asgard. The three piece now took serious form, meanwhile the demo recording was well received and caught the interest of metal labels, particularly Metal Blade Records. By December of 2009, the band had signed a deal with Metal Blade.\n\nStudio time at Sonic Train Studios in Varberg, Sweden was booked and in March 2010, the debut album was recorded with engineer Andy LaRocque. King of Asgard tracked thirteen songs of folk-based blackened death metal, reminiscent of times of old. During the summer, a video was shot for the album opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“EinhÃƒÂ¤rjarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, produced by Rickard Moneus from the production company 1897 (www.1897.se).\n\nKing of AsgardÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs debut album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“FiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mbulvintr,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in August of 2010 and made an astonishing impact on the scene. Still, the band was in need of a second guitarist for future live events. Lars TÃƒÂ¤ngmark was hired for the job in August of 2010. King of Asgard finally became active as a live performing act and played a bunch of successful festivals and club shows throughout 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn early 2012, King of Asgard finished the songwriting for their second album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦to North,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and returned to Sonic Train Studios in April, again with Andy LaRocque at the helm. Another video was released in May of 2012, once again with producer Rickard Moneus.\n\nOn the 22nd of July, 2014, King of Asgard will release their 3rd full-length Ã¢â‚¬Å“Karg.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third time recording with Andy LaRocque at Sonic Train Studios. Karl Beckman comments: Ã¢â‚¬Å“After well over a year of intensive writing, we finally reached the point where everything is put into finish. When countless hours of hard work and careful consideration has been completed. This completion, being our third album which at an early stage was titled to Ã¢â‚¬Å“KargÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in English, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BarrenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. A word which later on came to form the atmosphere of the whole album and a sense that meanders through more or less all the material. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darker, it is harsher, and more stripped down than our previous releases. More mature, precise and well thought out. A challenge both for us as well as for the observer. Lyrically, we have come closer to our own immediate surrounding and ancestral heritage, based on old legends and tales from our home region, a tribute to our fair and historical countryside. Yet again everything was recorded and mixed in Sonic Train Studios with Andy LaRocque at the helm assisted by Olof Berggren. Even in the phase of recording we used the word Karg as a guidelineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and thus, it is upon thee.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe6d160cf237f931c90ad02bb162eb62eb29566","amp;dn":"King+Of+Asgard+-+Karg++320k+++++mp3+++++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe6d160cf237f931c90ad02bb162eb62eb29566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,230,209,96,207,35,127,147,28,144,173,2,187,22,46,182,46,178,149,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
