Anam's baby is due in a few months, so it is no longer realistic for her and husband Wajid to share a home with eight members of their family. Piers pushes them to commit to bold architectural solutions, while Kieran scours the nation for low cost examples of the luxury they desire.\n\n2)  Marcus and Sholto \nJournalist Kieran Long and architect Piers Taylor follow the progress of Sholto and his partner Marcus. When the latter had to have a double organ transplant, the couple decided to leave their cramped house in the South of England and bought a rural patch of land in Scotland, 40 miles east of Inverness. The dream was to build their own residence, but finding a kit home which suited their needs was a struggle, so Piers and Kieran attempt to get the most out of their budget.\n\n3)  Andrew and Claire \nKieran and architect Piers Taylor meet Andrew and Claire, who have ditched their nine-to-five lives and gambled everything on a fledgling free-range egg farm - but still need a family home. They have plans to build a basic chalet-style bungalow. However, Kieran is concerned they'll end up with little more than a larger version of the static caravan they are desperate to move out of, while Piers challenges them to bring their own personality into their abode.\n\n4)  Joann and Andy \nKieran Long and Piers Taylor follow the progress of Jo'ann and Andy, who are attempting to build a home from scratch that will never produce a heating or electricity bill. Bare concrete floors and breeze block walls are helping the budget, but will their compact residence feel more basic bunker than family home? As well as taking them to an award-winning eco-home in Nottingham, Piers encourages them to design a lighting scheme with a sheet of acrylic and a Ã‚Â£5 light fitting. However, as their budget runs low, decisions on where to invest and where to save become trick\n\n5)  Heidi and Steve \nHeidi grew up in the countryside near Inverness, but she and husband Steven can't afford a home there. They've decided to try to construct one, but their strategy is a risky one. Heidi's parents have agreed to temporarily re-mortgage their own home to fund the Ã‚Â£70,000 build cost. The couple are keen to do as much of the work as possible, so Kieran Long takes them to see a property which is full of low-cost ideas that could add character to their home. Meanwhile, Piers Taylor visits a boat yard and a plastics bending factory in his search for design solutions that could be achieved on Heidi and Steven's budget.\n\n6)  Sue and Tim \nSue and Tim set out to prove they can build a low-cost contemporary farmhouse without scrimping on aspiration. Piers Taylor and Kieran Long are concerned that the cheap materials they plan to use could compromise the building's success, so Kieran shows them the latest in contemporary homes, and Piers helps them achieve a good look for less money. However, a major structural problem emerges that threatens the future of the project. Will they even be able to complete the home that they had such big dreams for?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/The-House-that-100k-Built-Series-2-Screen0.jpg&quot;
