Tell the wrong joke in Singapore or United Arab Emirates and risk being handcuffed before you ever leave the stage. Bring Achmed the Dead Terrorist on stage in Malaysia after a government warning forbidding his presence, and you may begin an indefinite vacation in Kuala Lumpur. While Dunham collects and crafts pop culture references that can excite a local audience upon entering each country - Achmed on this trepidation of returning to the Middle East, Walter's (lack of) understanding of current race relations in South Africa, Bubba J. finding kindred spirits in Australia - Jeff shows that humor is truly universal. Most of the time.\n\n\n01:23:32\n688x384\n23.976 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01dcb5e3cf8f87da0d25ef354773b2154006db5","amp;dn":"Jeff+Dunham%3A+All+Over+the+Map+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01dcb5e3cf8f87da0d25ef354773b2154006db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,29,203,94,60,248,248,125,160,210,94,243,84,119,59,33,84,0,109,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
