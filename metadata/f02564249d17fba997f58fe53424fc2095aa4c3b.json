Each episode was an eclectic, freeform mix of blues, folk, rockabilly, R&amp;B, soul, bebop, rock-and-roll, country and pop music, centered around a theme such as &quot;Weather,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; and &quot;Flowers&quot; with songs from artists as diverse as Patti Page and LL Cool J. Much of the material for the show's 100 episodes was culled from producer Eddie Gorodetsky's music collection, which reportedly includes more than 10,000 records and more than 140,000 digital files.\nInterspersed between the music segments were email readings, listener phone calls, vintage radio air checks, old radio promos and jingles, even older jokes from Dylan (&quot;My grandmother is so tidy she puts newspaper under the cuckoo clock&quot;), poetry recitations; taped messages from a variety of celebrities, musicians and comedians; and commentary from Dylan on the music and musicians as well as miscellanea related to the themes. The show was not live (Dylan taped his portions at various locations and while touring), and the studio location at the so-called &quot;Abernathy Building&quot; was fictitious. Most of the &quot;listener phone calls&quot; and emails were also fictitious, although at least one email read on the show came from an actual listener.\n\n\n2.1 Episode 51: Hello\n2.2 Episode 52: Young and Old\n2.3 Episode 53: Days of the Week\n2.4 Episode 54: California\n2.5 Episode 55: Classic Rock\n2.6 Episode 56: Cadillac\n2.7 Episode 57: Head to Toe\n2.8 Episode 58: Smoking\n2.9 Episode 59: Dreams\n2.10 Episode 60: Party\n2.11 Episode 61: Second Countdown\n2.12 Episode 62: Number One\n2.13 Episode 63: Walking\n2.14 Episode 64: Around the World I\n2.15 Episode 65: Around the World II\n2.16 Episode 66: Lock &amp; Key\n2.17 Episode 67: Mail\n2.18 Episode 68: Presidents' Day\n2.19 Episode 69: Doctors\n2.20 Episode 70: Danger\n2.21 Episode 71: Birds\n2.22 Episode 72: More Birds\n2.23 Episode 73: Joe\n2.24 Episode 74: Heat\n2.25 Episode 75: Cold","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02564249d17fba997f58fe53424fc2095aa4c3b","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+Theme+Time+Radio+Hour-Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02564249d17fba997f58fe53424fc2095aa4c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,37,100,36,157,23,251,169,151,245,143,229,52,36,252,32,149,170,76,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
