DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do just one ? do a whole sequence!\n \nThis bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary approach to sex guides you position-by-position from arousal to building excitement to orgasmic finish like nothing you have ever experienced before. Sex Position Sequences shows how to master 60 different positions and transition from one position to the next so the mood only gets hotter and hotter right up to the heart-pounding climax.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f071a7ecadc2916105313995be72f3d352eefe2e","amp;dn":"Sex+Position+Sequences+%282012%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f071a7ecadc2916105313995be72f3d352eefe2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,113,167,236,173,194,145,97,5,49,57,149,190,114,243,211,82,238,254,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
