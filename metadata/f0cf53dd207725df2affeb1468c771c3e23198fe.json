Amazing movie amazing acting and amazing tracks.\n\n- Big Papi\n\nimage\n\nBy mirasreviews VINE VOICE\nDirector William Friedkin chose Wang Chung to score &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; on the strength of the band's debut album &quot;Points on the Curve&quot;. Wang Chung's techno rhythms, lush interludes, and ironic lyrics turned out to be the perfect sound for Friedkin's complex, cynical neo-noir masterpiece and one of the most evocative film soundtracks of the 1980s. This CD includes 4 vocal tracks and 4 instrumental tracks.\n\nThe soundtrack kicks off with the film's title song &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;. William Friedkin had asked Wang Chung not to use the movie's title in a song. But Jack Hues and Nick Feldman did it anyway, and the result is terrific. -And Friedkin liked it. The immediately recognizable percussive &quot;clicking&quot; of the second track, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, was effective in heightening moments of relative silence in the film. &quot;Wait&quot;'s tentative, anxious rhythm and lyrics create palpable tension. This embodiment of the film's angst and unease may be its best vocal track. The first instrumental track, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, is also the longest track at 9:17 minutes. &quot;City of Angels&quot; is an unforgettable composition for an unforgettable scene. Its energetic techno beat help make &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;'s counterfeiting scene legendary.\n\nI mention &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Wait&quot;, and &quot;City of Angels&quot; because they are the most evocative of the film's tone. It would have been nice if &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; were included, since it is featured briefly in the film -and that's one reason I give this soundtrack 4 stars. This is good work by Wang Chung, without which one of the most memorable films of the 1980s would not have been as memorable. The soundtrack is invaluable to the film, but well worth listening to on its own.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - To Live and Die in L.A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: \nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1985\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 59 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Best Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
