From the opening of his file in March of 1953 to his assassination in 1965, the story of Malcolm XÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political life is a gripping one.\n\nShortly after he was released from a Boston prison in 1953, the FBI watched every move Malcolm X made. Their files on him totaled more than 3,600 pages, covering every facet of his life. \n\nViewing the file as a source of information about the ideological development and political significance of Malcolm X, historian Clayborne Carson examines MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship to other African-American leaders and institutions in order to define more clearly MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in modern history.\n\nWith its sobering scrutiny of the FBI and the national policing strategies of the 1950s and 1960s, Malcolm X: The FBI File is one of a kind: never before has there been so much material on the assassination of Malcolm X in one conclusive volume. 11 black-and-white photographs\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a8cd7accedbd6a0da7ca1c509374019945bf1d","amp;dn":"Malcolm+X%3A+The+FBI+File+by+Clayborne+Carson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a8cd7accedbd6a0da7ca1c509374019945bf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,168,205,122,204,237,189,106,13,167,202,28,80,147,116,1,153,69,191,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
