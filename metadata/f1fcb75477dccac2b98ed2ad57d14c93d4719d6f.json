The book is a biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and some of the men who served with him in his Cabinet from 1861 to 1865. Three of his Cabinet members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election: Edward Bates (Attorney General), Salmon Chase (Treasury), and William H. Seward (State). The book focuses on Lincoln's mostly successful attempts to reconcile conflicting personalities and political factions on the path to abolition and victory in the US Civil War.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fcb75477dccac2b98ed2ad57d14c93d4719d6f","amp;dn":"TEAM+OF+RIVALS+-+Doris+Kearns+Goodwin.+%28Abridged%29+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fcb75477dccac2b98ed2ad57d14c93d4719d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,252,183,84,119,220,202,194,185,142,210,173,87,209,76,147,212,113,157,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
