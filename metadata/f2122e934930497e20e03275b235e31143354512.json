It is considered the definitive book of etudes for study and performance for the trumpet, and a &quot;must have&quot; for any serious student of the instrument. The cost for this book keeps going up every year, and was about $85 last I checked. (It was $35 back in about 1990 when I bought my edition.)\n\nIt is PDF (Acrobat) format, 300 DPI black and white, and ready to print to 8.5 x 11.\n\nIt is also my very first torrent, so please forgive if I havn&amp;#039;t done this correctly yet, and rest assured that any problems will be rectified so this book gets shared as intended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2122e934930497e20e03275b235e31143354512","amp;dn":"Charlier+-+36+Advanced+Etudes+for+Trumpet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2122e934930497e20e03275b235e31143354512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,18,46,147,73,48,73,126,32,224,50,117,178,53,227,17,67,53,69,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
