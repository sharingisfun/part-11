Rather than taking on the target's identity himself (as in the comic book version), he protects his clients by completely integrating himself into their lives, to become a &quot;human target&quot;. Chance is accompanied by his business partner Winston (Chi McBride) and hired gun Guerrero (Jackie Earle Haley). Former client Ilsa Pucci (Indira Varma) becomes Chance's benefactor, while experienced thief Ames (Janet Montgomery) joins the team to seek redemption. Chance puts himself on the line to find the truth behind the mission. Even his own business partner Winston doesn't know what drove him towards this life.\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_target_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_target_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Complete Season 1 in HDTV (XviD/MP3) can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6087413/Human_Target_A_a__a___Complete_Season_1_%28Xvid_MP3%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6087413/Human_Target_A_a__a___Complete_Season_1_%28Xvid_MP3%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t350 MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t13 + 1 TitlePic\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ####################\n###########################  Here you go!  ###############################\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29e6bc2c378deed474817d809667d2b15864ab2","amp;dn":"Human+Target+-+Complete+Season+2+%5BHDTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29e6bc2c378deed474817d809667d2b15864ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,158,107,194,195,120,222,237,71,72,23,216,9,102,125,43,21,134,74,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
