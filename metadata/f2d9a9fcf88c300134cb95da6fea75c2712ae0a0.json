Get Cooking is the first book from bestselling cookbook author Mollie Katzen designed specifically for beginners, whether you are just starting to cook for yourself or trying to kick the restaurant habit. Unlike most cookbooks, the goal of Get Cooking is to get you in the kitchen, no matter what your experience level might be. \n\nIllustrated throughout with color photographs of each dish, Get Cooking gives you clear, step-by-step instructions for making everything from classic mashed potatoes to BroccoliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cheddar Cheese Calzones to Hot Fudge Sundaes (with homemade hot fudge!). With this book, anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½you includedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½can make delicious, fresh food, with a lot less expense (and a lot more satisfaction) than ordering in. \n\nYou may know Mollie Katzen as the author of such famous cookbooks as Moosewood Cookbook or The Enchanted Broccoli Forest; Get Cooking has all of the accessibility and personal warmth of those beloved books, but it is Mollie's first cookbook for vegetarians and omnivores alike. You will learn how to make North African Red Lentil Soup, Linguine with Spinach and Peas, and Chickpea and Mango CurryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and also Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup, Spinach Lasagna, and Steak Fajitas. \n\nWith Get Cooking in hand, you'll be serving everything from salads (such as Wilted Spinach Salad with Hazelnuts, Goat Cheese, and Golden Raisins) to desserts (try the Cheesecake Bars), with stops along the way for party snacks, a full array of side dishes, and a brilliant assortment of handcrafted burgers (bean, tofu, and mushroomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as beef, turkey, and tuna). Here at last is the cookbook that will make a cook out of everyone.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/95da/fb104590.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d9a9fcf88c300134cb95da6fea75c2712ae0a0","amp;dn":"Get+Cooking+150+Simple+Recipes+To+Get+You+Started+In+The+Kitchen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d9a9fcf88c300134cb95da6fea75c2712ae0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,217,169,252,248,140,48,1,52,203,149,218,111,234,117,194,113,42,224,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
