It features tactical play focused on positioning and careful use of resources. Built to keep you on your toes as you progress through the decks of your besieged ship while clearing enemies and trying to reach each level's elevator.\n\n\nPermadeath\nBuild your marines up into long range or up close death machines, but don't expect any mercy. Death is permanent and fallen marines are gone forever. Finding survivors not guaranteed.\n\nTurn and Squad Based Gameplay\nCommand up to four marines, each with their own gear, talents, and Action Points. Positioning is critical - even a lone enemy can be lethal! Sight and snipe or funnel enemies into a choke point and blow them up!\n\nFive marine classes\nFour ranks for promotion and talent tree access\nFive perks to further differentiate each marine\nClass specific weapons and armor\n\n\nProcedural Generation\nThe steampunk spaceship is composed of multiple decks you must progress through. Different environments and creatures await, and you'll never know for sure what lies beyond the next corner.\n\nFive human ship decks with a sixth Alien Deck to be implemented\nRandomized weapons, armor, and enemy units\n\n\nScore, Difficulty, and New Game Plus\nGet rated on your overall performance. Manage to fight your way past 25 levels of mayhem? New Game Plus offers fresh challenges. Currently three levels of difficulty and a to-be-implemented harder mode for the truly masochistic!
