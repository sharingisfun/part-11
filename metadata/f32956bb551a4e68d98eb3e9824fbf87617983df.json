He was the inventor of the term &quot;organized sound&quot;, a phrase meaning that certain timbres and rhythms can be grouped together, sublimating into a whole new definition of music. Although his complete surviving works only last about three hours, he has been recognised as an influence by several major composers of the late 20th century. His use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the &quot;Father of Electronic Music&quot; while Henry Miller described him as &quot;The stratospheric Colossus of Sound&quot;.\n\nTraclist\n\nCD 1\n1.
