The books are based around the mischievous schoolboy William Brown.  The series was published over a period of almost fifty years, between 1921 and 1970, however throughout the series the protagonist remains at the same eleven years of age. The first book was Just William, and often the entire series is named after this book. Each book, with the exception of Just William&amp;#039;s Luck, was a collection of short stories.  The series has spawned various television, film, theatre and radio adaptations. It also has a large fan following, with such groups as the Just William Society. (Wikipedia)\n\nThe following five episodes are selected from the ten short stories which make up the sixth of ten BBC abridged story collections.  First broadcast 2004.\n\n\n1.
