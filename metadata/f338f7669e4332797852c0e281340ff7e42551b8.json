ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not often that we think of decorative houseplants as Ã¢â‚¬Å“delicious,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but in Plant by Numbers, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no denying that author Steve Asbell makes his powerful debut as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“gourmet chefÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the floral color palette. With his unique and fun recipe-style approach, visually tantalizing full-color photography, and crystal-clear step-by-step instructions, Asbell takes interior container gardening to a sophisticated but foolproof new level. Each of the 50 projects within features a comprehensive shopping list and functional plant-a-gram (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a custom planting diagram), showing you precisely how to plant the container combinations to achieve the most beautiful results in your living space. Even better, interiorscaping has never been more affordable: youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll impress friends, family, and visitors with your luxurious-looking interior plant designs, and you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t break the bank in the process. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be entertained while you do it, too: AsbellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature wit and original planting projectsÃ¢â‚¬â€with titles like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flavor TrippinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jurassic Spark,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shower Caddy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Femme FataleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€make the beautiful designs in Plant by Numbers as much fun to read as they are to plant.
