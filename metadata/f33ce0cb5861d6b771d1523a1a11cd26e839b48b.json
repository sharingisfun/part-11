Confined to small, hidden mystery schools for centuries, and often misunderstood and misinterpreted today. Tantra is not just a collection of techniques to enhance sexual experience. As Osho shows in these pages, it is a complete science of self-realizatoin, based on the cumulative wisdom of centuries of exploration into the meaning of life and consciousness. Tantra-the very word means &quot;technique&quot;-is a set of powerful, transformative tools that can be used to bring new meaning andjoy to every aspect of our daily lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f33ce0cb5861d6b771d1523a1a11cd26e839b48b","amp;dn":"Book+of+The+Secrets+by+OSHO.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f33ce0cb5861d6b771d1523a1a11cd26e839b48b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,60,224,203,88,97,214,183,113,209,82,58,26,17,205,38,232,57,180,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
