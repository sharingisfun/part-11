They have a decisive influence on the great rush of revolution and change through which the world has passed in the last two hundred years. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith traces these ideas and their consequences from Adam Smith, through Marx and Lenin, to Keynes and to the thinking that gave shape to the concepts of the Cold War, the corporation and, now, the conflicts and concerns of the Third World. The Canadian-born, Berkeley-trained John Kenneth Galbraith remained something of a renegade in modern economics - and his work has been nothing if not provocative.\n\nBBC Production Notes\n====================\nProducer David KennardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comments:\n\nThe Age of Uncertainty series is, as far as I know, &quot;the one that got away.&quot; Though it featured the well-known J.K.Galbraith, it was loved by some and hated by others -- partly because of his direct political assessments, and partly because the style of the films wasn't to everyone's taste: quite cartoon-like in parts, sardonic/ironic in effect. Not the traditional &quot;posh&quot; BBC series.\n\nI was one of the three producer/directors on the 13-part series, which was premiered on the BBC in Spring 1977 and on PBS (through KCET Los Angeles) six months later. It was shot around the world on 16mm film, and featured many different types of special effect and reconstruction. It ran into a lot of political and critical rough water during the Reagan era, and to my knowledge was not re-broadcast after about 1980.\n\nHowever, it had quite wide educational distribution. I know that the library of UC Berkeley has a copy, and it is possible that KCET/LA have a copy though I have never asked them. The BBC was unhelpful when I contacted them, and I think they may have junked their master negatives (not unusual!).\n\nI think that the series has great historical value, and is eerily relevant today, as the financial market implodes, which Galbraith accurately foretold.\n\nEpisodes, Runtimes (mm:ss), Descriptions\n========================================\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Prophets and Promise of Classical Capitalism (56:12): The ideological development of classical capitalism in Britain and France and its flowering into an accepted certainty in the United States in the late 19th century. It discusses the contributions of Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 02 - The Manners and Morals of High Capitalism (55:51): The robber baron industrial capitalists of the late nineteenth century and examines their conspicuous consumption concept of earning and spending money. It discusses ways in which this concept affects our attitudes today.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Karl Marx: The Massive Dissent (56:11): The film opens with a view of MarxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tomb. Galbraith enumerates the different qualities of Karl Marx. We are shown the home where he was born in Trier, Germany, and his early life history is recounted. Hegel and the University of Berlin stand out as a high-point.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Colonial Idea (55:17): Focuses on colonialism and the colonial adventure, which Galbraith considers historically and as a continuing legacy.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lenin and the Great Ungluing (56:08): The outbreak of the first world war, with its absurd unreason, should have triumphantly fulfilled MarxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prophecy of the end of capitalism. The war and the events leading up to it are illustrated on stage by posturing knights. The life of Lenin is counterpointed with the scenes of war.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Rise and Fall of Money (56:09): This program focuses on the history and function of money in society, which Galbraith considers through an analysis of the cycles of instability and inflation that plague the system.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Mandarin Revolution (56:18): This program focuses on the world-wide slump that threatened economic disaster after World War I and the role of economist John Maynard KeynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ideas on saving the West.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Fatal Competition (56:13): This program investigates the origins and development of the military and industrial economy as a result of the cold war and the continuing rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Big Corporation (56:09): The corporation, as a myth and reality, is examined and dissected. Multi national corporations are prominent today, their image is similar no matter where the corporation is headquartered. Corporations are also leading the way in advancing capitalism as a form of governance that is in contradiction to and often times conflicting with democracy.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Land and People (56:06): This program focuses on the role of land in determining wealth and poverty and its effect on social and foreign policies.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Metropolis (56:06): This video portrays problems of the industrial society as seen in the urban metropolis, which best reflects its uncertainty and crisis.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Episode 12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Democracy, Leadership, Commitment (56:04): Focuses on the processes and operation of democracy with a look at the American experiment.
