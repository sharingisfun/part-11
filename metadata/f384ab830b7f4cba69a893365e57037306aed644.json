I've been talking about this before several times. There are lots of subliminal messages on CDs and DVDs out there. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for example I've read they've hidden a subliminal file saying something like &quot;join the army&quot;. Now many children watching this stuff have the unexplainable urge to join the army. Such methods being used by the illuminati are really criminal. Instead of merely talking about it, I thought it would be easier to just demonstrate how it's being done. This project shows the easiest way how to do it.\n\nBasically there are two folders in this torrent: the input folder and the output folder. In the input folder you have three files:\n\nA: hypnosis\nB: pink noise\nC: music\n\nIn the intermediary folder you have one file:\n\nD: hypnosis masked by pink noise and reduced volume\n\nThe output folder contains one file only:\n\nE: hypno-subliminal music - DANGER! PROLONGED EXPOSURE NOT RECOMMENDED!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f384ab830b7f4cba69a893365e57037306aed644","amp;dn":"Experimental+Hypno-Subliminal+Mental+Programming+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f384ab830b7f4cba69a893365e57037306aed644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,132,171,131,11,127,76,186,105,168,147,54,94,87,3,115,6,174,214,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
