Their only other charted song was &quot;Mr. Turnkey&quot; which was a minor hit that same year. \n\nThe LPs In the Year 2525 (Exordium &amp; Terminus) and The Early Writing of Zager &amp; Evans followed in quick succession before the end of the year, but the pair&amp;#039;s chart run had finished. Food for the Mind, released in 1971, proved their final LP.\n\nHere you will find all 3 albums as vinyl rips, processed to eliminate noise.\n\n1969 - 2525 (Exordium &amp; Terminus)\n1969 - Zager &amp; Evans\n1971 - Food for the mind\n\nEnjoy, PLEASE COMMENT, and seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f391ca83b1a05ee7fae8de395024ce044ae75482","amp;dn":"Zager+%26+Evans+-+3+albums+-+Zager+%26+Evans+-+2525+-+Food+for+the+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f391ca83b1a05ee7fae8de395024ce044ae75482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,145,202,131,177,160,94,231,250,232,222,57,80,36,206,4,74,231,84,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
