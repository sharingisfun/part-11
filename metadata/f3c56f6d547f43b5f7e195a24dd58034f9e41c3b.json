Nelson Riddle commented, &quot;Gershwin wrote tomorrow's music yesterday.  Almost every musician who contemplates a Gershwin tune is a little startled to discover that the melodies, harmonies and rhythms are right up-to-date.  No matter what kind of revolution takes place in music, it seems as though Gershwin has already been there, written it and gone on into the future.&quot;  With respect to Ira Gershwin's lyrics, the remark is equally apposite.\n\nThe paradox of Ella Fitzgerald's prominence in the history of jazz singing and her lack of emotional intensity is much less apparent on this album. George Gershwin's affinity with jazz, and the corresponding delight jazz musicians take in performing his material, allow the singer to fly with the music. As for brother Ira's lyrics, they receive their due as cheerful, tender and always delightful examples of the lyricist's art. The Songbook series remains one of Ella Fitzgerald's major contributions--among many--to American popular music and this in particular is one of the best of the sizeable bunch.\n\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1.
