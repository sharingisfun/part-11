Unfortunately it never was rebuilt or patched(to my knowledge) to work on any other OS then Win '95 and Win '98.\n\nHowever:\nIt does work , I got an old Win '98 machine 'lying around' for such an occasion.\nIt may well work by right clicking the Games exe and changing the compatability mode in\nother OSs.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LANDNAAbN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LANDNAAbN&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maNDAAaBN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/maNDAAaBN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&quot;7th Legion is set in an apocalyptic future Earth, a land only just beginning to heal from a raging world war brought on by centuries of overpopulation and consumerism. Hundreds of years previously, the privileged society of a used-up planet had been evacuated, leaving behind a world ravaged by overpopulation and disease. Those who survived split into seven Legions, each vying for military and political control. And the chosen ones are about to return.\n\nThe player controls the 7th Legion, the most powerful force, and builds various barracks, battle units, and hi-tech labs to churn out bigger and better fighting vehicles such as mechs and tanks. The gameplay gets underway immediately, as troops and vehicles move quickly across the map and into battle.&quot;\n\n\n\nThe crack is both in a folder called 'Crack' on the ISO and in the 7th LEGION Folder.\nDrop crack into game directory replace the original .exe\nAlways a good idea to backup the original exe first to a folder or by renaming it.\nNot there's likely to be a new patch or crack coming out lol.\n\nFormat:ISO\nUse any Virtual drive (e.g.Nero) or burn to CD.\n\n\n\n\nIt's a classic. \n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c64f4f4381f95ada334bb579cb33ca72170dd0","amp;dn":"7th+Legion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c64f4f4381f95ada334bb579cb33ca72170dd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,198,79,79,67,129,249,90,218,51,75,181,121,203,51,202,114,23,13,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
