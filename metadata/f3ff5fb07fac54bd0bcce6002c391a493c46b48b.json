Basically, you play as a cockroach, and have to solve puzzles and avoid traps, a lot of fun. The downside to this game is that in spite of it being revamped in 2004, you still only get 640x480 resolution, and you need to install Quick Time; the version they give you on the disc seems to be the only one the works properly, the latest version just made the game drag, so install the version on the ISO image (At recommended setting)to play the game.\n\nWiki:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Mojo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Mojo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kanblAaei&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kanblAaei&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have installed this on Windows 7 on several rigs works perfectly, just read the INSTRUCTIONS text file on the ISO.\n\nI have included Xpadder with an Xbox360 profile as well.\n\nEnjoy, &amp; please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ff5fb07fac54bd0bcce6002c391a493c46b48b","amp;dn":"Bad+Mojo%3A+Redux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ff5fb07fac54bd0bcce6002c391a493c46b48b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,255,95,176,127,172,84,189,11,204,230,0,44,57,26,73,60,70,180,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
