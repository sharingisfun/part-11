Waller was also a prolific songwriter, with many songs he wrote or co-wrote still known to modern audiences, such as &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, &quot;Ain&amp;#039;t Misbehavin&amp;#039;&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Me&quot;. Fellow pianist and composer Oscar Levant dubbed Waller &quot;the black Horowitz&quot; in a favorable comparison to Russian pianist Vladimir Horowitz[1]. A prolific composer of novelty swing tunes in the 1920s and 30s, Waller sold many of his compositions for relatively small sums, and as they became hits, other songwriters had already claimed them as their own. Thus many standards are alternatively, controversially attributed to Waller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f41c557fda67775892a2bc2bd511b5468568da96","amp;dn":"Fats+Waller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f41c557fda67775892a2bc2bd511b5468568da96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,28,85,127,218,103,119,88,146,162,188,43,213,17,181,70,133,104,218,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
