Herzog did this same type of short for GRIZZLY MAN but I honestly don't think it's half as entertaining as the actual film. I think these shorts can be entertaining but this here clocks in at 39-minutes and I honestly think it went on for way too long and there's really no structure behind any of it. We basically have Herzog going around with a hand held camera capturing the recording sessions. That's it. There's no doubt that the score is a pretty remarkable one as anyone who has seen the film will admit. There's also no doubt that it's interesting getting some behind-the-scenes stuff but unfortunately I thought it just went on and on and on until the point where you just didn't want to listen anymore. Still, fans of Herzog and his bizarre style will probably still want to check it out.\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XVID\nDuration                                 : 39mn 17s\nBit rate                                 : 2 365 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nAudio\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 39mn 17s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 110 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nEncoding settings                        : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\nLanguage                                 : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ac9a53efde2e01e7887309070d2d7b4cb1f09f","amp;dn":"Ode+to+the+dawn+of+man+%28Werner+Herzog%2C+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ac9a53efde2e01e7887309070d2d7b4cb1f09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,172,154,83,239,222,46,1,231,136,115,9,7,13,45,123,76,177,240,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
