Don't be surprised to learn that the answer to that question varies, depending on who we're talking about. Lou and Peter are preparing to get married. But marriage, wedding plans and commitment can get complicated at times...\n\nAnd so can relationships! More than anything, that is this episode is about - Lou and Peter, Ashley and Caleb, Lisa and Jack and of course Amy and Ty. Watch for Lisa to once again get involved in Lou's affairs - this time in a good way, and watch for Chase Powers - the cocky cowboy Amy competed against in the Ring of Fire competition - to make an interesting visit to Heartland.\n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Mar 28, 2010. This is the final episode of season 3 (but season 4 has been promised).\n\nepisode description information is from the blog at http://www.cbc.ca/heartland/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c8b0cdb33fb00e0d2bbac336dd3caa1be5a2dd","amp;dn":"Heartland.S03E18.In.The.Cards.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4c8b0cdb33fb00e0d2bbac336dd3caa1be5a2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,200,176,205,179,63,176,14,13,43,186,195,54,221,60,170,27,229,162,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
