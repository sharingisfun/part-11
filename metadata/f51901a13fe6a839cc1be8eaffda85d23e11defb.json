In a series of visits he inspected every corner of the camp and interviewed dozens of personnel, from guards and interrogators to cooks and nurses. The resultÃ¢â‚¬â€coming just as the Obama administration wants to close the facilityÃ¢â‚¬â€is a riveting description of daily life for both prisoners and guards. Cucullu describes the six camps reserved for different levels of compliance, details the treatment of prisoners, and examines their experiences in detail, including the techniques used to interrogate them, the food they eat, their medical care, how they communicate with one another, and the many ingenious ways they contrive to assault and injure their guards.\n\nWhile some prisoners were indeed treated harshly in the early days, when the hastily built camp was flooded with battlefield captures and fears ran high of another 9/11-style attack, Cucullu finds that these excesses were quickly corrected. Current treatment and oversight routines exceed the standards of any maximum-security prison in the world.\n\nDespite what the public has heard, these are not innocent goatherds but dedicated jihadists whose overriding goalÃ¢â‚¬â€as they themselves candidly sayÃ¢â‚¬â€is to kill Americans. Should they now be released to return to the fight, perhaps on American soil? Read this book and decide for yourself.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51901a13fe6a839cc1be8eaffda85d23e11defb","amp;dn":"Inside+Gitmo%3A+The+True+Story+Behind+the+Myths+of+Guantanamo+Bay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51901a13fe6a839cc1be8eaffda85d23e11defb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,25,1,161,63,230,168,57,204,27,232,234,255,218,133,210,62,17,222,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
