The only poor choice was &quot;Not to Touch the Earth,&quot; which could have been replaced with any number of more significant songs in the band's catalog. When Elektra reissued the title on CD in the mid-'90s, the label removed &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; and added a couple additional tracks to the program. This time, the extended version of &quot;The Ghost Song,&quot; which had surfaced on the reissue of An American Prayer (the original version is a couple minutes shorter), was the poor choice -- it too is not the kind of thing a casual fan needs on an overview.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Hello, I Love You\n[02] Light My Fire\n[03] People Are Strange\n[04] Love Me Two Times\n[05] Riders On The Storm\n[06] Break On Through\n[07] Roadhouse Blues [Live]\n[08] Touch Me\n[09] L.A.
