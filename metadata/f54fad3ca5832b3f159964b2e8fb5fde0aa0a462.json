After the end of her movie career following the critically panned production of The Wiz, Ross&amp;#039; music career was also at an ebb. Save for the clubs who were playing her old hits with the Supremes, pop and R&amp;B radio paid little attention to Ross&amp;#039; solo recordings.\n\nAfter the moderate success of 1979&amp;#039;s The Boss, Ross wanted a fresher, more modern sound. Production team Bernard Edwards &amp; Nile Rodgers of Chic had recently written an album with Aretha Franklin in mind. Franklin had declined the offer and the material, including &quot;Upside Down&quot;, was subsequently passed on to Ross.\n\nWhat proved to be a grueling recording process with the singer was made even longer when Ross abandoned the sessions after producers Edwards and Rodgers informed her she was singing flat. Despite repeated conflicts during the recording sessions, the album was completed. Reportedly, Ross was anything but pleased with the results. Following an advance preview of the record, to be released in the aftermath of the anti-disco backlash, an influential New York City disc jockey warned Ross it would even be the end of her career.\n\nWhen the master tapes were submitted to Motown, a nervous Ross had resident Motown engineer Russ Terrana remix the album, toning down the funkier elements of Chic&amp;#039;s playing, removing extended instrumental passages - and most noticeably, speeding up the tracks to give the singer&amp;#039;s voice a brighter, more youthful sound. The remixing of the master tapes and the re-recording of Ross&amp;#039; lead vocals was done without the knowledge or approval of Rodgers and Edwards (in 2003, Motown issued a deluxe two CD version of diana and included the original &quot;Chic mix&quot; as well as several bonus tracks). When asked to produce Ross&amp;#039; next album Rodgers and Edwards politely declined. Rodgers and Ross were however to collaborate on album Workin&amp;#039; Overtime in 1989 and Edwards produced one song for her in 1984 (&quot;Telephone&quot;).\n\nReleased in May 1980, the diana album introduced Ross to a new generation of fans. Reaching number two on the Billboard 200 album chart and #1 on the Billboard Soul Albums Chart, as well as yielding two Top Ten singles including the number one single &quot;Upside Down&quot;, the album would sell over six million copies in the US alone and be certified platinum within months. It remains Ross&amp;#039; bestselling studio album.\n\ndiana was one of four albums written and produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers in 1980, the other three being Sister Sledge&amp;#039;s Love Somebody Today, Sheila and B. Devotion&amp;#039;s King of the World including European hit single &quot;Spacer&quot;, and Chic&amp;#039;s fourth studio album Real People.\n\nThe success of diana managed to resurrect Ross&amp;#039; music career. Following the release of two more singles, the duet &quot;Endless Love&quot; with Lionel Richie and &quot;It&amp;#039;s My Turn&quot;, Ross left Motown, signed a then-record breaking $20 million deal with RCA Records. The first album for the label was 1981&amp;#039;s self-produced Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc: 1\n\nDiana Released Album Mix\n01. Upside Down\n02. Tenderness\n03.
