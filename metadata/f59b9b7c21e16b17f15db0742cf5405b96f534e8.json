Don't judge this group by their strange and drug-induced performance on Rokk i Reykjavik, this turned out to be one of the best groups I'd ever heard. More like a dirty Duran Duran or Simple Minds than punk, with great keyboards and drums. \n\nSinger = Asgeir Jonsson, bass = Baldvin Sigurdsson, keyboards = Jon Freysson, guitar = Thor Freysson, drums = Sigfus Ottarsson (only 14 years old and one of the best drummers you could hear). For a sample search you*tube &quot;Bara Flokkurinn / The Just Group&quot;\n\n\nThis torrent is their best-of CD, released a few years back.\n\n  [1] It's All Planned\n  [2] Catcher Comin'\n  [3] Radio Prison\n  [4] I Don't Like Your Style\n  [5] Motion\n  [6] Windows\n  [7] Insult\n  [8] A Matter of Time\n  [9] Burnt Out\n [10] Watch that Cat\n [11] In the Quiet of the Night\n [12] Facts\n [13] So Long\n [14] Take Good Care of Yourself\n [15] Get Out\n [16] Leafless Trees\n [17] Just Like You\n [18] I Don't Like Your Style (single version)\n\nTracks [1]-[3] are from their first self-titled album, [4]-[7] are from their second album &quot;Lizt&quot;, and tracks [8]-[16] makes up their third and final album &quot;GAS&quot; in its entirety.
