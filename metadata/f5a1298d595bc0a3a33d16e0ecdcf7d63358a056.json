Savage was named 'British Producer of the Year' for 2010. \n\nDownload includes - cover art, inlay, booklet\n\nNotes Reviews Admiral Fallow were born out of a Glasgow based musical collective in 2006. A gathering of precocious talent fronted by the young foot-stamping, utterly captivativing singer-songwriter Louis Abbott. The band meld and indie-rock lineup with clarinet, flute, double bass and two jaw-dropping vocals to deliver their joyous, heart-filled, and beautifully eccentric and finely crafted songs. \n\nThey are fiercely proud of their roots with AbbottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Scottish accent to the fore in his singing, contrasting magically with the Northumbrian tones of Sarah Hayes, the second vocalist. \n\nTheir sets go from simple voice and guitar compositions, through stomping Wilco-esque tunes, to riotous cacophonies of bluring guitar; all sung with delightful abandon. \n\n&quot;Intimate and epic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ quite stunning&quot; The Herald Scotland  \n\n&quot;An astounding first album&quot; Music News  \n\n&quot;A lovely, well-crafted album&quot; The Sunday Mail  \n\n&quot;Brooding, heartfelt folk leanings are bolstered by a soundtrack of colourful orchestration, including flute, strings and double bass - a rich concoction that has caught the attention of more than a few unsuspecting ears.
