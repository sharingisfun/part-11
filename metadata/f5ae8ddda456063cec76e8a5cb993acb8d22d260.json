Chet Atkins&amp;#039;s lush production fit like a cardigan sweater around the Texan&amp;#039;s cozy baritone; it was a sound traditionalists believed was antithetical to true country music. Record buyers, however, begged to differ--in droves. The so-called countrypolitan movement produced its share of schlock, but Reeves had much going for him, most notably a knack for finding apropos material, including &quot;Welcome to My World,&quot; &quot;Four Walls,&quot; and &quot;He&amp;#039;ll Have to Go.&quot; This 20-track overview features 20 trademark tunes cut between 1957 and his death in a 1964 plane crash. For refined rural Romeos and Juliets, these are the cozy tunes that established the country crooner as something of a Nat King Cole in cowboy boots. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ae8ddda456063cec76e8a5cb993acb8d22d260","amp;dn":"%5BCountry%5D+-+The+Essential+Jim+Reeves+%5BRCA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ae8ddda456063cec76e8a5cb993acb8d22d260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,174,141,221,164,86,6,60,236,118,232,165,203,153,58,203,141,34,210,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
