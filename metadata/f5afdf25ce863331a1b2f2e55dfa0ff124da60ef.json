First, students read lessons that include a variety of charts, tables, and graphs. Then, they answer critical thinking questions to improve their understanding of the science concepts and develop their reading comprehension, and inferential and deductive thinking skills. Students can&amp;#039;t just scan the story for answersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½they must carefully analyze and synthesize the information from the text and charts, tables, and graphs to explain and support their answers.\n\nTeaching Support includes teacher and student introductions, a chart of topics and key ideas to help select activities, and detailed answers.\n\nSkills that are addressed include:\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE\n\n    * Physical Properties: Observing, Measuring\n    * States &amp; Classification of Matter\n    * Change of Phase\n    * Position, Distance &amp; Motion\n    * Pushing &amp; Pulling Forces\n    * Sound, Hearing &amp; Force\n    * Light: Reflection &amp; Refraction\n    * Heat: Sources, Conduction\n    * Electricity &amp; Circuits / Symbols\n    * Magnetism, Electromagnetism\n\nLIFE SCIENCE\n\n    * Animals, Plants &amp; Environment\n    * Instincts &amp; Behavior\n    * Plant &amp; Animal Cells\n    * Plant Structure, Function &amp; Survival\n    * Animal, Plants &amp; Energy\n    * Animal Needs &amp; Behavior\n    * The Five Senses &amp; Survival\n    * Life Cycles: Plants &amp; Animals\n    * Heredity\n    * Environment &amp; Change\n\nEARTH SCIENCE\n\n    * Earth Science &amp; Earth Materials\n    * Minerals / Soils / Rocks\n    * Objects in the Sky / The Sun\n    * Changes to the Earth&amp;#039;s Surface\n    * Atmosphere &amp; Weather\n    * Measuring Temperature, Air Pressure &amp; Humidity\n    * Motion of Objects in the Universe \n\nFormat: paperback, 150 pages\nAuthor: S.
