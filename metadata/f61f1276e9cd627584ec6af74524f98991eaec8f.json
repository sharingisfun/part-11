Not even a director is listed.  The executive producer is Rob Johnstone. There is quite a bit of minutiae, and very little in the way of appearances by the man with the very long name that ends up being just three letters.\n\nThere are a bunch of snippets of what look like music videos I've never seen or heard anything about.  They look quite interesting. If anybody has access to them, do post them (and let me know!). The picture above is from &quot;The Seven Deadly Finns&quot;.\n\nNot an exhausting list, but what is covered, mainly, is:\n\nObscure records\n801\nRoxy Music (and why the two Bs had to split up)\nCluster (and Harmonia)\nBowie\nThe Winkies\nJohn Cage\n\nand the very beginnings of his production activities (with the Talking Heads and Devo)\n\nLots of talking heads. A well balanced look at his early, and for many, his most interesting, years. Still, another one of those Rock Docs with a disclaimer:\n\nThe film is not authorized or sanctioned by Brian Eno, or by any party representing him.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61f1276e9cd627584ec6af74524f98991eaec8f","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+1971-1977+The+Man+Who+Fell+to+Earth+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61f1276e9cd627584ec6af74524f98991eaec8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,31,18,118,233,205,98,117,132,236,106,247,69,36,249,137,145,234,236,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
