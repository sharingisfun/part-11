The first half of the show is archived video interviews and concert footage (and people's personal thoughts/memories of Adam), the second half is less mainstream Beastie Boys videos from over the years.  The last few seconds of the last video was cut off, my apologies.\n\nI'm not a fan of the Beastie Boys, but I thought some of their fans outside of Canada would like to see this tribute special, in high quality.\n\n\nCOMMENTS BELOW ARE APPRECIATED.  Hint hint. :)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f625c50e318e839bd63be23ac6d410130ee745e5","amp;dn":"beastie.boys-a.tribute.to.adam.yauch.may.2012.the.wedge.muchmusi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f625c50e318e839bd63be23ac6d410130ee745e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,37,197,14,49,142,131,155,214,59,226,58,198,212,16,19,14,231,69,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
