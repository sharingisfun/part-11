With this unprecedented access, Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Robert Weide followed the notoriously private film legend over a year and a half to create the ultimate film biography. Woody Allen: A Documentary chronicles Allen's career - from teen writer to Sid Caeser's TV scribe, from standup comedian to award-winning writer-director averaging one film-per-year for more than 40 years. Exploring Allen's writing habits, casting, directing, and relationship with his actors first-hand, new interviews with A-listers, writing partners, family and friends provide insight and backstory to the usually inscrutable filmmaker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6342414871f007ba98d68b06f5eb2e54bbba8a1","amp;dn":"Woody+Allen+A+Documentary+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6342414871f007ba98d68b06f5eb2e54bbba8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,52,36,20,135,31,0,123,169,141,104,176,111,94,178,229,75,187,168,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
