It is not to be reckless or lazy. It is not to be unpunctual, badly presented or poorly spoken.\n\nTo be unprofessional is to be real. It is to create a vision that is unborrowed from the past. It is to develop products that genuinely Ã¢â‚¬ËœwowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ your audience. It is to think of marketing strategies that the management consultants donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have diagrams or buzz words for yet. It is to think original thoughts and speak of proactive ideas that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet been documented in the academic playbooks.\n\nAt just 26 years old, Jack Delosa knows more than youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect about business and entrepreneurship. A self-made millionaire by 24, Delosa is an award-winning entrepreneur and educator who has built several start-ups into successful thriving businesses. In UnProfessional, Delosa reflects on his business adventures and offers practical how-to advice on topics such as becoming a market leader on a shoestring budget, becoming the go-to person in your industry to win more business faster, how to manage and lead other people toward your vision and why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to fail fast.\n\nThe business world has changed. What worked in the past will not work today. Offering a fresh perspective on the challenges of starting and running a successful business, UnProfessional is an ideal guide for AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current crop of forward-thinking entrepreneurs of any age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69abe4e5ca7a7512c6c0c5a0a944cc3d023fc5e","amp;dn":"UnProfessional+%28Jack+Delosa%29+Retail+epub+PDF+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69abe4e5ca7a7512c6c0c5a0a944cc3d023fc5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,154,190,78,92,167,167,81,44,108,12,90,10,148,76,195,208,35,252,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
