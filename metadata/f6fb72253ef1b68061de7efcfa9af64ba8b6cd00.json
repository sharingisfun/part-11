As with the first game, a technology demo was released prior to the commercial release, on October 19, 1997, at an unannounced online IRC party. The demo contained the first set of levels from the single-player game, and contained no multiplayer support.\n\nQuake II's game engine was once again far ahead of anything else commercially available, and the full version of the game was released to the public on December 9, 1997.\n\nWhile a sequel in name, Quake II's story had little to do with the first game in the series. You play a space marine stranded on &quot;Stroggos&quot;, an alien planet in the midst of attacking Earth.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n- WindowsÃ‚Â® 95 or NT 4.0 with 100% compatible computer system \n- PentiumÃ‚Â® 90 MHz Processor (133 MHz recommended)\n\nMemory:\n- Win 95 - 16 MB RAM Required (24 MB recommended) \n- Win NT 4.0 - 24 MB RAM Required\n\n- 100% Sound Blaster-compatible sound card \n- Joystick and mouse-supported (3-button mouse recommended) \n- Supports network and internet play via TCP/IP \n- Minimum Install Additional Requirements (Play from CD-ROM) \n- Quad-Speed CD-ROM drive (600k/sec. sustained transfer rate) \n- Hard Disk drive with at least 25 MB of uncompressed space available \n- Normal Install Additional Requirements (Play from Hard Disk)\n\nGLQuake II Additional Requirements \n- 24 MB RAM for all operating systems \n- GLQuake II supports some OpenGL 3D accelerator cards\n\n______Official addons______ \n\n\nQuake 2 Mission Pack: The Reckoning\n\nQuake 2 Mission Pack: Ground Zero\n\nQuake 2 Netpack I: Extremities\n\n\n________Unofficial addons________\n\nQuake 2 Mission Pack: Zaero\n\nQuake 2 : Juggernaut\n\n_________--___________--_________--__________\n\n\nFull CD-images with soundtracks\n\nLanguage:English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fb72253ef1b68061de7efcfa9af64ba8b6cd00","amp;dn":"Quake+II+Complete+anthology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fb72253ef1b68061de7efcfa9af64ba8b6cd00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,251,114,37,62,241,182,128,97,222,126,252,250,154,246,75,168,182,205,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
