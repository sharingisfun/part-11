In 1992, the Airwave designer's first film 'Instability' helped thousands of pilots gain insight into tips and tricks learnt by the professional test pilots.\nAs paragliders have developed, so have the techniques required to fly them safely through turbulence and during radical manouvres. Instability 2 is an essential update for all pilots wanting to fly at their safest. This DVD and accompanying booklet will guide you step-by-step through some of the most critical lessons you&amp;sup1;ll need as a paraglider pilot.\n\nInstability 2 is not a do-it-yourself instructional guide. To learn any of the manouvres outlined on this DVD, you should be under instruction from an experienced SIV instructor in appropriate conditions.\nRunning time: 38 minutes. DVD all regions. Shot on location in the maritime Alps, south of France.\n\nParagliding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71d0b9fd7e69120aad7b2a85d4bf2c550e35af8","amp;dn":"Instability+II+-+Paragliding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71d0b9fd7e69120aad7b2a85d4bf2c550e35af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,29,11,159,215,230,145,32,170,215,178,168,93,75,242,197,80,227,90,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
