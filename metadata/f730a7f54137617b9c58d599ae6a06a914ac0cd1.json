From traditional gangland enterprises such as narcotics, gambling, and prostitution, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mafias have moved into new sources of illegal income, including high-tech arms smuggling, money laundering, and identity fraud. Traditional Crime in the Modern World tracks these organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€the Italian and Mexican mafias, Columbian drug cartels, Chinese triads, and othersÃ¢â‚¬â€across five continents as they adapt to change, and assesses their prospects in the short and long term. World events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 9/11 terror attacks are discussed in the context of contributing to emerging markets for illicit goods and services, and to evolving partnerships among criminal entities.\nThis timely volume:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Provides a comprehensive overview of how mafia-like structures function today.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Analyzes in depth national crime situations with global implications.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Examines the migration of organized crime groups and their operations in their new countries.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gauges the influence of digital and other technologies on organized crime.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Where applicable, notes the links between organized crime and national political institutions.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Describes the impact of the global financial crisis on crime organizations.
