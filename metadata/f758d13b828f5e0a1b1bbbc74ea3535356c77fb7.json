Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began in the early 1960s with Ike as a member of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.[5] Success followed with a string of notable hits including &quot;River Deep Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mountain High&quot; (1966) and &quot;Proud Mary&quot; (1971).\n\nTurner later revealed several severe instances of domestic abuse in her autobiography, I, Tina, against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. Raised a Baptist, Turner converted to Buddhism in 1974, crediting the religion and its spiritual chants for getting her through difficult times in her life.[6] Following her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career by constantly performing, eventually launching another series of hits starting in 1983 with the single &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; and the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer. &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It,&quot; the most popular single from the album, would later serve as the title of a biographical film about Turner that was adapted from her autobiography. In addition to her music career, Turner has also experienced success in movies, including a role in the 1975 rock musical, Tommy and a starring role in the 1985 Mel Gibson action flick, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, later appearing in a cameo role in the 1993 film, Last Action Hero.\n\n\nPrivate Dancer 1984\n\n\nPrivate Dancer is the fifth solo album by Tina Turner, released on Capitol Records in 1984. The album was Turner's breakthrough after several challenging years of going solo after divorcing husband and performing partner Ike Turner. It is her best-selling album both in the U.S. and internationally and was responsible for making her globally famous. It was produced in England with four different production teams including Rupert Hine, and Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh of Heaven 17. The album produced seven singles, including &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot;, &quot;Better Be Good To Me, &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, and &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot;. Positively received by critics on release for Turner's ability to give energy and raw emotion to slickly produced professional pop/rock songs; its long term legacy is that the softening of her raw Southern soul style produced a &quot;landmark&quot; in the &quot;evolution of pop-soul music&quot;.[2] The album was promoted throughout 1985 in a 177 date worldwide tour called the Private Dancer Tour.\n\nA&amp;R man John Carter of Capitol Records is credited with relaunching the career of Tina Turner in the 1980s.[3] In 1983, despite opposition from within Capitol, he signed her and A&amp;Red her first album for the label, Private Dancer.\n\nThe album was produced in England using several different producers.[2] &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; was produced by Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh of British band Heaven 17. Terry Britten produced the reggae-tinged &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot;. John Carter produced &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, which was written by Mark Knopfler and has a guitar solo by Jeff Beck. Rupert Hine produced &quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot;, which had been written by Holly Knight, Mike Chapman, and Nicky Chinn, and most of the other songs.[4] &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot;, a cover of The Temptations song which was Turner's first collaboration with the B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation)/Heaven 17 production team and part of their collaborative 1982 album Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One was not included on the Private Dancer album. A recording of Sam Cooke's &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; from the same sessions would re-appear in remixed form on B.E.F.'s Music of Quality and Distinction Volume Two in 1991. &quot;Help&quot; was recorded with The Crusaders.\n\nThe album was release on 29 May 1984 and became an outstanding commercial success. Private Dancer has been certified 5 Ãƒâ€” Platinum (5 million[5]) in the United States and sold around 250,000 each week for 2 months. Worldwide the album has been estimated to have sold over 20 million copies.[6]\n\nThe album produced a number of highly successful singles including &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot; which went to number one and stayed there for three weeks. At the 1985 Grammy Awards, Private Dancer won four of the six awards for which it was nominated. No less than seven of the album's ten tracks (nine in the U.S.) were released as singles: &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot;, which was a UK Top 10 hit and a US Top 20 hit; &quot;Help&quot;; &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot;; &quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot;; &quot;Private Dancer&quot;;, &quot;I Can't Stand the Rain&quot; and &quot;Show Some Respect&quot; (1985).\n\nThe critical reviews of the album were positive. The Los Angeles Times reviewer felt that her voice &quot;melts vinyl&quot;.[7] Debby Miller, in a July 1984 Rolling Stone review, felt that the album was a powerful comeback, with Turner's voice &quot;rasping but strong&quot;, and a range of songs that were all good in a &quot;modern rock setting&quot; that was &quot;neither detached nor very fussy&quot;.[4] Robert Christgau felt that she was able to deliver with honesty the &quot;middlebrow angst of contemporary professional songwriting&quot; and remain in control of an album with four different production teams to give it a &quot;seamless authority&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Might Have Been Queen&quot; \n2.\t&quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Show Some Respect&quot; \n4.\t&quot;I Can't Stand the Rain&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Private Dancer&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Steel Claw&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Help!&quot; \n10.\t&quot;1984&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f758d13b828f5e0a1b1bbbc74ea3535356c77fb7","amp;dn":"Tina+Turner+-+Private+Dancer+1984+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f758d13b828f5e0a1b1bbbc74ea3535356c77fb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,88,209,59,130,143,94,10,27,27,187,199,78,163,83,83,86,199,127,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
