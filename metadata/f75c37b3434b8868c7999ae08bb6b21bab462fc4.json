While seemingly playing off of the concept of Snakes on a Plane, the film was in production at the very same time as Snakes on a Plane and was developed independently.\n\nThe film was originally titled Plane Dead, but the title was changed at Montreal's 2007 Fantasia Festival screening. However, in spite of a successful screening there and at other festivals, the film did not gain a commercial release and was issued directly to DVD in unrated form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75c37b3434b8868c7999ae08bb6b21bab462fc4","amp;dn":"Flight+of+the+Living+Dead%3A+Outbreak+on+a+Plane+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75c37b3434b8868c7999ae08bb6b21bab462fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,92,55,179,67,75,136,104,199,153,154,224,139,182,178,27,171,70,47,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
