Gerry Roslie and company were one of the greatest american garage bands to ever make a record. For years this record was unavailable except for the rare and expensive original on the Etiquette label. People lucky enough to have a copy have spoke of its greatness for decades. Thankfully Norton has reissued this and the equally great Sonics Boom. Now everyone can hear this powerhouse. Gerry Roslie was no less than the white Little Richard, screaming his way through classics like Psycho, The Witch, Strychnine and Have Love Will Travel. Every song is a killer. Anyone interested in the true birth of punk rock has to hear this stuff. Norton did a beautiful job remastering and repackaging this classic with the tracks from the ultra rare Etiquette Christmas record as a bonus. This stuff is definitely not for the faint hearted!\n[/quote]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Sonics, The - Here Are the Sonics!!!
