Barenboim, with BoulezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assistance, will have none of it. He phrases his fingerings with lyrical finesse, while BoulezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s passion for clarity reaps large rewards in the play of colours and instrumental balance. Like restored paintings with the nasty varnish removed, the concertos emerge reborn, and newly powerful.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Times, 21st October 2011\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a8d87df01427a0d946a5f20f24094fa75f2a5e","amp;dn":"Liszt+-+The+Piano+Concertos+-+Barenboim+and+Boulez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a8d87df01427a0d946a5f20f24094fa75f2a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,168,216,125,240,20,39,160,217,70,165,242,15,36,9,79,167,95,42,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
