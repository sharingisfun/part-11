But rarely do these fearful, salacious dispatches come from sex workers themselves, and rarely do they deviate from the position that sex workers must be rescued from their condition, and the industry simply abolished Ã¢â‚¬â€ a position common among feminists and conservatives alike.\n\nIn Playing the Whore, journalist Melissa Gira Grant turns these pieties on their head, arguing for an overhaul in the way we think about sex work. Based on ten years of writing and reporting on the sex trade, and grounded in her experience as an organizer, advocate, and former sex worker, Playing the Whore dismantles pervasive myths about sex work, criticizes both conditions within the sex industry and its criminalization, and argues that separating sex work from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“legitimateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ economy only harms those who perform sexual labor. In Playing the Whore, sex workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ demands, too long relegated to the margins, take center stage: sex work iswork, and sex workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rights are human rights.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;Gira Grant is one of the most interesting policy thinkers in the country when it comes to sex work, and this short book introduces and outlines her thinking on the matter.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œMike Konczal, Washington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An informative and extremely worthwhile addition to the existing body of literature on sex work.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œStoya, adult performer and Vice columnist\n\nThis torrent contains a retail PDF version and the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, and LIT formats done in Calibre.
