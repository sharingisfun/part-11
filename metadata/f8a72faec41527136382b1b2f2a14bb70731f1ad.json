But it\n      isn't. And he doesn't pretend it is. It's showmanship and skill,\n      not paranormal power. So how does the man who knows every trick\n      in the book react to people who claim there is no book? To start\n      his new debunking series, he spends time with Liverpool psychic\n      Joe Power, who claims he communes with the dead. Excellent\n      scenes ensue, particularly when Power fails a test that Derren\n      sets up, and becomes a very unhappy medium.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
