The album sold over 3 million copies worldwide.\n\nThis album marks something of a transition for A-Ha, moving away \nfrom the 80's synthesized sound into something more moody. \nBut don't be scared, it will grow on you! \n\nCrying in the rain A great cover of a great song - it was the first \nsingle, which is an indication that the album doesn't really have any \nsongs that are viable instant hits.\n\nEast of the sun is a departure from the last album, with the pop \nsounds almost entirely replaced by soft rock with a 60's/70's feel.\n\nRolling Thunder I think A-ha recorded this and someone must have said \n&quot;That sounds a bit like Crying in the rain&quot; Which gave them the idea \nto cover said song. It's even got the same thunder/rain samples on it!\nIt's a very good song though and a rolling rock ballad.\nSeemingly non-stop July A slow acoustic ballad to end the album gently. \n\nIn a sense A-ha don't seem to be being themselves, so it can take a \nbit of getting used to, if all you have heard is what has come before.\n__________\n\n 1.
