On their second full-length, the Killers respond in kind by digging even deeper into the muddy, mysterious blues well. This is not to say that duo has run out of original ideas or are retreating to the safety of worn out riffage and twelve bar shuffles. In fact, the Killers' wailing, ear-splitting versions of tunes like the traditional &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; and R.L. Burnside's &quot;Goin' Down South&quot; are played in a manner that is equal parts studied reverence and aggressive force. Even a drunken take on &quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot; is completely devoid of irony. Equally as loud and ragged, but with a more defined sense of purpose than its predecessor, Love Is a Charm of Powerful Trouble only serves to strengthen the footing of the Killers' unique hybrid.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9078f5d3c133bc1998c511cd830129a94ef142e","amp;dn":"Immortal+Lee+County+Killers+-+Love+is+a+Charm+of+Powerful+Troubl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9078f5d3c133bc1998c511cd830129a94ef142e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,7,143,93,60,19,59,193,153,140,81,28,216,48,18,154,148,239,20,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
