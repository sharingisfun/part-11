But it does have some intriguing twists and turns along the way. Devon Allman Ã¢â‚¬â€ son of Gregg, leader of the group Honeytribe and member of the all-star Royal Southern Brotherhood Ã¢â‚¬â€ released his first Ã¢â‚¬Å“soloÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album, Turquoise, back in February 2013.\nFor Ragged &amp; Dirty, Allman left his Southern comfort zone, hired a crack Chicago band, and enlisted the producing and writing talents of Grammy winning producer Tom Hambridge.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For Ragged &amp; Dirty I really wanted to change my entire approach. I had made all my previous records down south, but this time I wanted to record in the electric blues Mecca of Chicago, with cats that live and breathe playing blues based music.\n\nI also enlisted Tom Hambridge to produce. He custom-wrote songs for me, which was a first and having him quarterbacking the sessions from behind the drum kit was a unique experience for me as well. He was in the trenches with me every step of the way.  Tom pulled my essence out on this record and pushed me in a most positive manner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f914ab1dc0f8797d70862151090816e3e18781ce","amp;dn":"Devon+Allman+-+Ragged+%26amp%3B+Dirty+%282014%29+MP3VBR+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f914ab1dc0f8797d70862151090816e3e18781ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,20,171,29,192,248,121,125,112,134,33,81,9,8,22,227,225,135,129,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
