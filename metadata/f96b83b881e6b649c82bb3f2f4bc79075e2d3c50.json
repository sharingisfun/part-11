But how do you make the leap from the old favorites to arrive at something new? Joen Wolfrom has been experimenting with that concept for years, developing innovative yet fairly foolproof methods for moving from standard patterns into bold new designs. Her lucid text and abundance of good color diagrams dissect the process clearly and in detail. Beginning with the anatomy of basic quilt blocks, Wolfram demonstrates how to give them a face lift by blending, adding, rotating, varying sizes, stretching, condensing, accentuating repetition, playing with color, and otherwise altering them to achieve dynamic, imaginative quilts. Dozens of beautiful color photos of quilts by many artists supplement Wolfrom's work to provide a gallery of inspiration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96b83b881e6b649c82bb3f2f4bc79075e2d3c50","amp;dn":"Patchwork+Persuasion%3A+Creative+Possibilities+from+Traditional+Qu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96b83b881e6b649c82bb3f2f4bc79075e2d3c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,107,131,184,129,230,182,73,200,43,179,242,244,188,121,7,94,45,60,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
