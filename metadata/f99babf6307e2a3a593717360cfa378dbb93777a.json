Smithâ€™s critically acclaimed and popular Eating History: Thirty Turning Points in the Making of American Cuisine, this volume recounts the individuals, ingredients, corporations, controversies, and myriad events responsible for Americaâ€™s diverse and complex beverage scene. Smith revisits the countryâ€™s major historical momentsâ€”colonization, the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion, the temperance movement, Prohibition, and its repealâ€”and he tracks the growth of the American beverage industry throughout the world. The result is an intoxicating encounter with an often overlooked aspect of American culture and global influence.\r\n\r\nAmericans have invented, adopted, modified, and commercialized tens of thousands of beveragesâ€”whether alcoholic or nonalcoholic, carbonated or caffeinated, warm or frozen, watery or thick, spicy or sweet. These include uncommon cocktails, varieties of coffee and milk, and such iconic creations as Welchâ€™s Grape Juice, Coca-Cola, root beer, and Kool-Aid. Involved in their creation and promotion were entrepreneurs and environmentalists, bartenders and bottlers, politicians and lobbyists, organized and unorganized criminals, teetotalers and drunks, German and Italian immigrants, savvy advertisers and gullible consumers, prohibitionists and medical professionals, and everyday Americans in love with their brew.\r\n\r\nSmith weaves a wild history full of surprising stories and explanations for such classic slogans as â€œtaxation with and without representation;â€ â€œthe lips that touch wine will never touch mine;â€ and â€œrum, Romanism, and rebellion.â€ He reintroduces readers to Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the colorful John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed), and he rediscovers Americaâ€™s vast literary and cultural engagement with beverages and their relationship to politics, identity, and health","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99babf6307e2a3a593717360cfa378dbb93777a","amp;dn":"Drinking+History+%282012%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99babf6307e2a3a593717360cfa378dbb93777a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,155,171,246,48,126,42,58,89,55,23,54,12,250,55,141,187,147,119,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
