This is the story of a young man who feels such indebtedness to another young man after he is saved from committing suicide by jumping in front of an oncoming train. So strong is his sense of gratitude that he follows his 'savior' even to the kidnapping of a wealthy woman. But there are ulterior motives to the kidnapping, complicating it with other details that intertwine and make for a typical British murder mystery. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cd5ae542452c9c08811b11461891035d370b79","amp;dn":"Gallowglass+-+Ruth+Rendell+++%281993+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cd5ae542452c9c08811b11461891035d370b79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,205,90,229,66,69,44,156,8,129,27,17,70,24,145,3,93,55,11,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
