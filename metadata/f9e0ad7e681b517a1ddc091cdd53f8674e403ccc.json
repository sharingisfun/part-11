The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above-ground.\nAs a first-person shooter, Metro 2033 features a variety of firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player will use in combat. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and the player fighting hostile humans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e0ad7e681b517a1ddc091cdd53f8674e403ccc","amp;dn":"Metro+2033","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e0ad7e681b517a1ddc091cdd53f8674e403ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,224,173,126,104,27,81,122,29,220,9,28,221,83,248,103,78,64,60,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
