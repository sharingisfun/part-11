Now available for the first time ever as a complete book, this edition contains never-before-released scenes and special bonus material. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss this erotic tale of a powerful billionaire who always gets what he wants and the young woman whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to enter his exclusive realmÃ¢â‚¬â€œa world of glittering opulence and all-consuming passion, where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.\nLucy DelacourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s temp position isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite her dream job but it pays the bills. The highlight of her day is riding the elevator in the mornings with a handsome stranger. Tall, dark, and sexy as hell, Lucy knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way out of her league, but a girl can look, right? Everything changes the day the stranger seduces her. Completely out of character, she yields without a Fight, but she has no idea her wanton acts with a man whose name she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know will change her life forever. Because the sexy stranger is none other than Jeremiah Hamilton, billionaire CEO of Hamilton Industries, and one taste isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly enough to satisfy his need. As the billionaire pulls Lucy deeper into his world of high stakes business deals and ruthless takeovers, he demands nothing less than her complete surrender. But even as enemies seek deadly revenge against him, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover that her greatest threat is falling for her fiercely guarded bossÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and yielding to her own darkest needs.\n\n\nFrom the author:\nThere are (essentially) two ways a reader could have come to this series: 1) You read the serials, or 2) you read the novel. The serials are how the series was originally released (Essentially, a serial is one story released in smaller segments. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reason why I Love this format so much: it allows me the ability to give readers exactly what they want (more story) AS I FINISH EACH PART. Sure, I could wait until the story is finished and just release the novel, but I came from a fan fiction background where authors give their readers the story in progress. AHW was meant to be an experiment to see if that format could have a wider market, and as such was a wild success!), but in November of 2012, St. MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Press released the novel to much wider distribution.\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read the novel itself, DISREGARD the first five serials. You have the compiled version in your hand of Anything He Wants parts 1-5; the novel is essentially the same as the serials.\nSerials:  The Meeting (#1) / The Contract (#2) / The Secret (#3) / The Rescue (#4) / The Betrayal (#5)\n \n&quot;Dominated by the Billionaire&quot; is the 1st book of the &quot;Anything He Wants&quot; Series.\n\n\n\nIs this torrent dead?
