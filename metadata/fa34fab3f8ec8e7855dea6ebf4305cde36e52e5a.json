Krishna \n is left behind by the circus and he takes a \n train to Bombay. Krishna is called Chaipau  \n by the street children of Bombay and he     \n works delivering and selling tea for        \n Chacha, who owns a street bar. Krishna      \n befriends the heroin addicted Chillum       \n that sells drugs for the drug dealer and    \n caftan Baba Golub, and the girl Manju Golub,\n who is the daughter of Baba with the        \n prostitute Rekha Golub.
