They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make us feel happier or richer. Why are they not designed as well as the products we love to use such as an Apple iPod or a BMW?\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬ËœdevelopedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ world has moved beyond the industrial mindset of products and the majority of Ã¢â‚¬ËœproductsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that we encounter are actually parts of a larger service network. These services comprise people, technology, places, time and objects that form the entire service experience. In most cases some of the touchpoints are designed, but in many situations the service as a complete ecology just Ã¢â‚¬Å“happensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is not consciously designed at all, which is why they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like iPods or BMWs.\n\nOne of the goals of service design is to redress this imbalance and to design services that have the same appeal and experience as the products we love, whether it is buying insurance, going on holiday, filling in a tax return, or having a heart transplant. Another important aspect of service design is its potential for design innovation and intervention in the big issues facing us, such as transport, sustainability, government, finance, communications and healthcare.\n\nService Design is an eminently practical guide to designing services that work for people. It offers powerful insights, methods, and case studies to help you design, implement, and measure multichannel service experiences with greater impact for customers, businesses, and society.\n\nAlong with many other insights, this book offers:\n- A clear explanation of what service design is and what makes it different from other ways of thinking about design, marketing and business.\n- Service design insights, methods and case studies to help you move up the project food chain and have a bigger design impact on the entire service ecosystem.\n- Practical advice to help you sell the value of service thinking within your organisation and to clients.\n- Ways to help you develop business, design, environmental and social innovation through service design.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
