From pets to beasts of burden and even just a friendly face in the barn, animals like these produce thousands of products you use around the house every day and can be a great addition to your home, property, or small farm. For anyone looking to raise such animals though, the realities of their new furry and feathery companions can be jolting; from the care they need on a regular basis to the food they eat. This book was written for anyone considering purchasing and raising domesticated animals for family pets, producers of eggs and milk, or a friendly creature in the backyard.
