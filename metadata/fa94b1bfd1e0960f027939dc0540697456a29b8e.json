Seduced and brought into the extravagant lifestyle of the rich and powerful, Lucy was swept up into the highest highs, and experienced dangerous lows, but always there was her billionaire protector. Safe in his arms, she thought for sure her life had finally found the right track. Until she couldn't hold back saying those three little words, and found out how fragile her new position was. Her affections spurned by the man she loves, the dejected young woman is kidnapped from Jeremiah's home and discovers more about another facet of the Hamilton family legacy. Lucas Hamilton, known in darker company as Loki, is an arms dealer and Jeremiah's brother. He needs Lucy for his own purposes, but makes it no secret that he wants to get back at his brother any way he can for stealing the family empire. Dangerous outside forces seem intent on taking the proud and wealthy New York family down. But what will broken-hearted Lucy do when her new captor sets his sights on seduction? No matter what happens, Lucy's life will never again be the same.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE NOVEL.
