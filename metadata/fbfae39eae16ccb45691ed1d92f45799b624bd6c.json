Little Walter made his way north to Chicago via stops in New Orleans and Monroe, Louisiana; St. Helena, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; and St. Louis, Missouri, arriving in the Windy City in 1947. That same year, he made his first recordings for the local Ora Nelle label. Little Walter and Muddy Waters first appeared on a session together when both backed Jimmy Rogers in 1949. Waters backed Little Walter on a session for Parkway Records in January 1950. That August, Little Walter first backed Muddy for the Chess label, and in October, they recorded the Waters classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLouisiana Blues.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Nearly a year after Little WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s initial appearance on a Muddy Waters session for Chess, he used an amplified harmonica for the first time on a groundbreaking July 1951 session that yielded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe Moves Me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Waters was among the earliest to recognize that blues possessed a formidable power when electrified, and with Jimmy Rogers on electric guitar and Little Walter on amplified harp, he had the hottest blues band in Chicago. Little Walter split from WatersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ band after an instrumental showcase of his that was popular with crowds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYour Cat Will Play,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ retitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when he recorded it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ became a huge solo hit. A classic juke-joint instrumental, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ topped the R&amp;B chart for eight weeks in the fall of 1952.\n[img]http://rockhall.com/media/assets/inductees/default/little-walter.jpg[/img]\nIn addition to harmonica, Little Walter played guitar, sang and wrote songs. He recruited a backing band from the Chicago club scene (whom he rechristened the Jukes, after his big song), and they recorded and toured throughout the Fifties. On his own, Little Walter charted 14 Top Ten R&amp;B hits for the Chess labelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Checker subsidiary. Another single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy BabeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ written by Willie Dixon and featuring the melody from the spiritual ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis TrainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - went to #1. Other sizable hits from Little Walter included ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSad Hours,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMean Old World,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlues With a Feeling,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re So Fine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh, BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Last Night.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At Leonard ChessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behest, Little Walter continued recording with Muddy Waters, too, adding his unmistakable harmonica to such classics as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Your Hoochie Coochie ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrouble No More.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nLittle WalterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s had a pervasive influence on succeeding generations of harmonica players, especially in Britain, where he was revered by a rising generation of blues-smitten rock and rollers. Unfortunately, his predilection for drinking, fighting and self-destructive behavior caught up with him. Little Walter died in 1968, at the age of 37, from head injuries suffered in a street brawl\n\nTrack List:\n01. It Ain't Right [02:53]\n02. Rocker [03:06]\n03. I Got To Find My Baby [02:49]\n04.
