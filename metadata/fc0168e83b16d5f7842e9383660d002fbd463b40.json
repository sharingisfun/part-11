Hypnotically engrossing, this picture delves deep into the psyches of its two main characters, employing irony, humor, and drama to weave a masterful tale of human interaction.\n\nIn A Short Film About Love, Krzysztof Kieslowski, through his collaborators, screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, composer Zbigniew Preisner, and cinematographer Witold Adamek, displays superb directorial skills, presenting a complex web of emotions and ideas with precise visual economy and effective restrained performances from a capable cast.\n\n\nScreenshots\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?pid=567#p567&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?pid=567#p567&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nFile Size (in bytes): 1.05 GB (1,134,741,504 bytes)\nRuntime (# of frames): 1:22:44 (124,085 frames)\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 720 x 448\nFPS: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate: 1630 kb/s\nBits per Pixel: 0.202\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nAudio bitrate: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave: 96 ms\nNo. of audio streams: 1\n\nSubtitles: English, Turkish\n\n\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic \nart in the digital era.
