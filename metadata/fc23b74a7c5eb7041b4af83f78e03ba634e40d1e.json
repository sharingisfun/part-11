It treats the delicate theme of sibling incest with great subtlety and sympathy. The development of the relationship between brother and sister is totally plausible and beautifully portrayed by the young actors Alexandra Schalaudek and Florian Heiden. The viewer soon comes to sympathize with them and with their illicit feelings for each other as he watches their mutual attraction building up towards the (inevitable) breaking of the taboo. This scene, like the entire movie, is very beautifully and very tastefully shot. I watched it on DVD and I really could not believe just how good this little movie with all its budgetary and other restraints was. If you are not offended by that kind of topic watch it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc23b74a7c5eb7041b4af83f78e03ba634e40d1e","amp;dn":"Der+Kuss+Meiner+Schwester","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc23b74a7c5eb7041b4af83f78e03ba634e40d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,35,183,74,124,94,183,4,27,74,248,63,120,224,59,166,52,228,13,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
