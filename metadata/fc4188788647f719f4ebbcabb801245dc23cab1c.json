But whilst mourning the death, failure and corruption of the last centuries romantic optimism he also brings about the awareness of a new generation who may once again discover the innocence in those old ideals.\n\n\n--------------\n\nthanks pa6sur for the rip\n\n--------------\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
