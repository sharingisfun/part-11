In 1964 this pink-inked feline slinked onto the opening credits of Blake Edwards&amp;#039; caper film by the same name and threatened to steal the entire show. Sleek sophisticated and witty the animation produced by Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie was a stylish departure from its contemporaries and an instant hit. A subsequent short film The Pink Phink would go on to win* an OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and spawn a celebrated series of six-minute cartoons featuring the sly cat. Now for the first time 124 cartoons produced by Freleng and DePatie between 1964 and 1980 are collected here in a swingin&amp;#039; 5-disc set. With over 14 hours of &quot;pink comedy&quot; you can&amp;#039;t help but lick your whiskers!\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Panther_(character)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Panther_(character)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/show/14100/summary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/show/14100/summary.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRelease date on DVD:\nJanuary 31, 2006\n\nSource:\nR1 NTSC DVD\n\nVideo:\nFull Frame 1.33:1\n\nAudio:\nDolby Digital Mono\n\nSubtitles:\nFrench, Portuguese, Spanish\n\nRuntime:\n13 hours 17 minutes (5 discs)\n\nDVD features:\n- &quot;Behind the Feline: The Cartoon Phenomenon&quot; Documentary\n- &quot;Pink Patter With Art Leonardi: The Story Behind the Animation&quot; Featurette\n- &quot;Remembering Friz: A Tribute to Friz Freleng&quot; Featurette\n- &quot;Think Pink: How to Draw the Pink Panther&quot; Featurette\n- Page to Screen: The Making of Two Cartoons\n- Animated Main Title Sequences From Five of the Feature Films \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc544ea03e954d798e9b2712cba36f4599c5a4b3","amp;dn":"The+Pink+Panther+Classic+Cartoon+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc544ea03e954d798e9b2712cba36f4599c5a4b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,84,78,160,62,149,77,121,142,155,39,18,203,163,111,69,153,197,164,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
