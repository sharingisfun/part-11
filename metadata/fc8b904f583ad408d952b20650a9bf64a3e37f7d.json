It's about a band of rogue DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government that, incomprehensibly, preferred jazz. The Count, a big, brash, American god of the airwaves; Quentin, the boss of Radio Rock -- a pirate radio station in the middle of the North Sea that's populated by an eclectic crew of rock and roll DJs; Gavin, the greatest DJ in Britain who has just returned from his drug tour of America to reclaim his rightful position; Dave, an ironic, intelligent and cruelly funny co-broadcaster; and a fearsome British government official out for blood against the drug takers and lawbreakers of a once-great nation.\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Music\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis file will play on the following list.\n\n* PC ----- PowerDVD, VLC Media Player\n* MAC ----- Roxio Toast Video Player, VLC Media Player\n* PS3 ----- Direct from External HD or streaming using a Media Server such as PS3 Media Sever\n* X-box 360 ----- Windows 7 and streaming on the network through Windows Media Center\n\nSpecifications\n\n* Codec ----- H.264\n* Resolution ----- 1920x1080\n* Bitrate ----- 4.3 Mbps\n* Frame Rate ----- 24 fps\n* Audio ----- AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640Kb)\n* Language ----- English\n* Subtitles ----- None\n* Aspect Ratio ----- 2.35:1\n* Source ----- Blu-Ray\n\nProcedure and Testing\n\n* This file is kept under 4GB for easy storage (Dang FAT32!)\n* Hi quality 2-pass H.264 standard encoding\n* Tested on Sony PS3 Firmware 3.21\n* Tested on Samsung 750s 120hz 52ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ LCD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8b904f583ad408d952b20650a9bf64a3e37f7d","amp;dn":"Pirate+Radio+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8b904f583ad408d952b20650a9bf64a3e37f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,139,144,79,88,58,212,8,217,82,178,6,80,169,191,100,163,227,127,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
