The lyrics tell a story you can't hear anywhere else and the music is his most innovative of recent years. The writing is some of the best of his career and both veteran fans and those who are new to Bruce will find much to love on Wrecking Ball.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fceb4db2bb218b7d0d879baf7365b82e915cfe61","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-++Wrecking+Ball+%5Bmp3-256-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fceb4db2bb218b7d0d879baf7365b82e915cfe61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,235,77,178,187,33,139,125,13,135,155,175,115,101,184,46,145,92,254,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
