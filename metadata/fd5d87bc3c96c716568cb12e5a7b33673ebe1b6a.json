He devises a drug, that when applied to the eyes, enables the user to see beyond the normal realm of our sight (ultraviolet rays etc.) it also gives the user the power to see through objects. Xavier tests this drug on himself, when his funding is cut off. As he continues to test the drug on himself, Xavier begins to see, not only through walls and clothes, but through the very fabric of reality!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5d87bc3c96c716568cb12e5a7b33673ebe1b6a","amp;dn":"X+-+The+Man+with+the+X-Ray+Eyes+1963+Roger+Corman+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5d87bc3c96c716568cb12e5a7b33673ebe1b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,93,135,188,60,150,199,22,86,140,177,46,90,123,51,103,62,190,27,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
