For  this  second  edition  the  author  has  revised  all  the \nexisting  chapters,  added  two  new  ones,  and  updated  the  bibliography.  He  has  also  added  an  appendix  describing  some  of \nthe  deep misunderstanding of,  and consequent violent  reaction \nto,  the  book  in  Germany, Austria,  and  Switzerland where  the \nbook  has  tested  the  limits  of  freedom  of  speech. \n\nThe focus of the book  is the application of ethics  to difficult and \ncontroversial  social  questions:  equality  and  discrimination  by \nrace,  sex,  ability,  or  species;  abortion,  euthanasia,  and  embryo \nexperimentation;  the Moral Status of animals; political violence \nand civil  disobedience;  overseas aid and  the obligation  to assist \nothers;  responsibility  for  the environment;  the  treatment of refÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­ugees.  Singer  explains  and  assesses  relevant  arguments  in  a \nperspicuous,  non doctrinaire  way.  He  structures  the  book  to \nshow  how  contemporary  controversies  often  have  deep  philosophical roots; and he presents an ethical theory of his own that \ncan be applied  consistently and convincingly  to all  the practical \ncases. \n\nThe  book's  primary  readership  remains  teachers  and  students \nof  ethics  whether  in  philosophy  or  some  other  branch  of  the \nhumanities  or  social  sciences.  However,  such  is  the  clarity  of \nthe book's style and structure that it should interest any thinking \nperson concerned with  the most difficult social problems  facing \nus  as we  approach  the  twenty-frst  century.
