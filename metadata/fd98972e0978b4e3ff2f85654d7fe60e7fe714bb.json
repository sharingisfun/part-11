ENJoY!\n\nHUGH TRACEY RECORDINGS - Congo Songs &amp; Dances\n\nHugh Tracey, 1903 - 1977\n\nHugh Tracey recorded extensively from the Sudan border down to the Cape of Good Hope. A whole sub-continent, a life's work! He was one of the pioneers of ethnomusicology and was responsible more than anybody else for 'putting African music on the map'. Indeed, if you put your finger almost anywhere on a map of that half of Africa, you will find a closely corresponding recording in Tracey's vast output. Most important of all, many of his recordings are the only recordings of certain musics which have long since disappeared.\n\nHiQuality: 320Kbps + full cover scans\n\n\n\nThis OLD collection of Hugh Tracey recordings is very hard to get.\nI released No.1, No.7 and No.8 - If you have any other recordings \nof the old collection please let us know - just post a comment. \nThank you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd98972e0978b4e3ff2f85654d7fe60e7fe714bb","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Congo+Songs+%26+Dances+%28vinyl+rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd98972e0978b4e3ff2f85654d7fe60e7fe714bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,152,151,46,9,120,180,227,255,47,133,101,77,127,230,14,127,231,20,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
