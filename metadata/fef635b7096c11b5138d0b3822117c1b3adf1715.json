Behind this lies a short name adult adventure and &quot;dark&quot; that will carry us to a world ravaged by a terrible disease ... and dangerous creatures known as Shadows. \n\nThe character that we control (at least to start, because then will be adding others) is Nier, a father tormented by his daughter's illness Yonah, evil that has infected much of the population. The disease is known as Black Scrawl and closely linked with the main enemies that await us in this adventure, The Shadow. Our goal is clear: find a cure for our daughter and settle as many shadows cross our path.\n\n\nPlease seed after download....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef635b7096c11b5138d0b3822117c1b3adf1715","amp;dn":"Nier+%5BEnglish%5D%5BRegion+Free%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef635b7096c11b5138d0b3822117c1b3adf1715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,246,53,183,9,108,17,181,19,141,11,56,34,17,124,27,58,223,23,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
