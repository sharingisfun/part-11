Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Birta and Arbez have created a well-rounded, general introduction to a very difficult field to enter. The text fills a clear gap in the resources available for introducing this field. The holistic, neutral treatment of a wide variety of topics provides an alternative to the typical modeling and simulation survey course. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Appropriate for an upper-division undergraduate course leading to a concentration in modeling and simulation. It would be equally well suited as a first course in modeling and simulation at the graduate level. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The authors have succeeded in creating a broad, balanced perspective of the modeling and simulation discipline. Readers will gain a refreshingly unified understanding of how simulation springs from conceptual models and context.&quot; (Thom Mclean, ACM Computing Reviews, December, 2007)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef9c72f20481668f0e77a938d2ea2d4276d8736","amp;dn":"Modelling+and+simulation+ISBN%3A+1846286212","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef9c72f20481668f0e77a938d2ea2d4276d8736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,249,199,47,32,72,22,104,240,231,122,147,141,46,162,212,39,109,135,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
