Almost immediately afterward, he was informed that his sister had been killed by drug dealers. Rhodes traveled to Little Mogadishu, or &quot;The Mog,&quot; a dangerous section of Brooklyn, New York City, controlled by gang warlords and drug dealers. Looking for his sister's killers, he demanded answers of both the police and the deadly street gangs who ruled the lawless territory. Receiving none of the answers he sought, Rhodes took matters into his own hands.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff61c3acd606f449b5bdb91451c3e53b8b755dc1","amp;dn":"The+Crew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff61c3acd606f449b5bdb91451c3e53b8b755dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,97,195,172,214,6,244,73,181,189,185,20,81,195,229,59,139,117,93,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
