Read HIS writings (and those were prolific!) instead and make your mind.\nHere the serious student will find a very abangent spectrum of A.C.'s writing corpus, as well as precious jewels and rare works. You get even facsimile manuscripts!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n&quot;This shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart &amp; my tongue, unto whom I send this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever To me!
