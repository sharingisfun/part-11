This fifth edition outlines therapeutic approaches and suggests treatment and management options, providing a wealth of practical information, supported by clear diagrams and photographs, on assessment, management and treatment. The book emphasises an eclectic, holistic approach, and integrates current ideas on motor control and motor learning in a further development of LevittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Collaborative Learning Approach. This new edition provides greater commentary on evidence-based practice, as well as practical, updated information on the use of botulinum toxin, orthopaedic surgery and the therapist's role following these procedures.\n\nThe book is aimed primarily at practitioners and students concerned with the developmental abilities and difficulties of children, particularly physiotherapists and occupational therapists working in paediatrics. Doctors and other healthcare professionals will also find useful insights in the book. Parents, families and also teachers of people with cerebral palsy can learn more about therapy by consulting the book together with their therapist.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Written by an international authority in the field\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extensively revised, updated and well referenced\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Emphasises an eclectic, functional and holistic approach\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Highly illustrated\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Promotes positive relationships between therapists, people with cerebral palsy and their families","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fffcd634d0b51a6e7430233f2ffaa57e4d504fdd","amp;dn":"Treatment+of+Cerebral+Palsy+and+Motor+Delay%2C+5E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fffcd634d0b51a6e7430233f2ffaa57e4d504fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,252,214,52,208,181,26,110,116,48,35,63,47,250,165,126,77,80,79,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
